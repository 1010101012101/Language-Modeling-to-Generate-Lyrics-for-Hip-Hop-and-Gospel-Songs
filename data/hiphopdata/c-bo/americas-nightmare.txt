22 years old, bold with much guts 
 O.G. from the hood kickin' up dust 
 Once I got ya, no one can save ya 
 Fresh out the swamp, a neighborhood gator 
 One-times want some action, I'm paper lapped and taxin' 
 Bo dropped them like the Jacksons 
 Don't sing, down with Rodney King 
 Solo on the scene, let my dick swing 
 Fuck the white man and his plan 
 America's nightmare is who the fuck I am 
 Six-feet and dark skin, with skills of a marksman 
 Kill at will when I feel like barkin' 
 So step to my left side, as I aim with my right eye 
 'Cause at the end all the whites die 
 Pay is what you owe 
 I'll have a hundred and fifty billion blacks at the white house front do' 
 And I won't eat pork on a God-damn mission 
 And no I'm not a member of the Muslim religion 
 Platinum, one million stackin' 
 Flood the hood with tapes, now everybody's rappin' 
 And jackin' so how it happen, captain 
 It's the general, sucka no, indo with the fo' fo' 
 Auto mag saggin' without a rag 
 One in the chamber, ready for the fuckin' danger 
 Call up your boys, it's worser then the watts riot 
 Whitey got his buck stopped in the violence 
 Lyrics that flow, letting your punk-ass know 
 Standing right here's America's Nightmare 
 Walk like I'm on my way to execution 
 A.K. in my hand is what I'm usin' 
 Confusin fools run up and catch the bruisin 
 Tatoo's under rest in peace cause of the music 
 I'm hard-core, six deep in a ford explorer, ready for the fuckin' war 
 So when it's on take cover 
 A.K's dance from the gutter, thick gloves for the smother 
 No finger tips so there's no evidence 
 Plus I dumped the A.K's in the ditch 
 Hit the switches, fuck the bitches 
 I'm a killah, hardcore nappy head guerilla 
 Soudin like cube, so give the president the bad news 
 Another ex-con with flow, fool 
 No tattoo's so you can't mark me 
 Down with my sista's, FUCK charles barkley 
 Send me to the war, and I'll push the button 
 America's Nightmare saggin' and struttin' 
 Fuck the coppers, let 'em have it with the choppers 
 Trigger happy like "O-Dawg", trick, America's Nightmare 
 It's that locced out madness that got these steel toes thumpin' 
 And it's that henn though that got me drunk as a motherfucker 
 Bangin' like pots and pans 'fore day he yells 
 Thousand watts 15's on thangs with no L's 
 America's nightmare, strapped to a tee 
 Cocked and ready to bust it's that H.K. forty 
 I'm known to get further on the block then white P.D. 
 Get out of sight quickly, dump when I'm tipsy 
 Crip-made hookers I'm the one that you fear 
 America's night, motherfuckin' mare 
 Uh, so bring it on when it's on 
 Fools strapped up back to back then I make that call to the dome 
 I got bounce like a baller but I'm real like air dog 
 And when it gets funky I attack like a bear hog 
 Dawg, so pick a bone with the next man 
 'Cause I, am, a crazy lunatic man 
 I crease my own khaki', you fools can't jack me 
 Or eat a strap of fully loaded mac daddy 
 And don't give a fuck, plus can't wait to buck 
 Full pump slugs will catch you 'fore that ass ducks 
 Fool I gets even, steven ain't even breathin 
 Fucked and bucked him, eternal bleedin' 
 On the concrete, passed away like some bomb weed 
 Fuck freddy, it's me trick: America's nightmare
