 Every where I go niggaz be holla out my name 
 Talking the about the set I claim and the gang I hang 
 Ain't nothing damm thang change 
 All y'all niggas, y'all can't fuck with me we throwing up the C 
 Tell me what y'all want to do and how y'all niggas really wanted to be 
 (C-Bo Chorus) 
 We just Crippin, Crippin, Crippin all night 
 We just Dippin, Dippin, Dippin let's ride 
 (C-Bo) 
 It's C-Bo and that nigga daz in an four rag 
 With an auto mag, tag, blasting niggas about the move 
 Feeling to do this out the roof, twenty-one guns and loop 
 And crush son like Big Pun, I die for 29th street 
 Like Daz would die for 21 
 Connect gang, wreck thang, disrespect I swing the tech man 
 For the guard and blocks for the Insane 
 If you down for your gang and throw your rags in the air 
 Flag the mother fuckers like you just don't care 
 I'm going to ride for mine, do or die for mine 
 South side duce nine, Long Beach eastside 
 We going ride together, sly eye together 
 We going crip and die together, getting high forever 
 (Daz Dillinger) 
 C-Bo, Daz Dillie 
 Serving other niggas in their city, getting greedy 
 Seen getting shity, rolling vapor are dilly 
 Now it's time to get stupid or really (Yeah) 
 High stone roll everywhere I Rohm with the meat on my bone 
 Me and C-Bo we keep going zone to zone 
 My type reaps are anonymous 
 Coke, weed, cock, feeds we dropping them 
 Four kills, an emmy, and in the mode to kill 
 Prepare for your blood to get spilled, that's on the real 
 Rhino we explode like dynamite 
 How many niggas getting killed tonight 
 Is you, you, you, and all of you 
 Back flossing with the mother fucking mack 
 Going clip from clip, bout my business and shit 
 Fly whips and getting dip, we ain't taking no shit 
 See we serious about this and lyrically about this 
 Curious about this, its beautiful without this 
 How can you come to an battle without an gun 
 (C-Bo) 
 You get done fucking with duce ninety-two-one 
 (C-Bo Hook) 
 (C-Bo Chorus) 
 (Daz Dillinger) 
 I guess the war zone, get soldiers and let's go to war 
 Putting work mother fucker even the storm 
 Meeting machine guns, grenades, and 45's 
 Crazy in the land when its hard to survive 
 Catching the nigga slipping, the blunt, and the crippin 
 On the mission blasting niggas if you already 
 See we bang for the living, use the gun to go to prison 
 Doing hell of time with them scandalous bitches 
 Back looped out, smoked out hit an another one 
 When I'm bombed out, smoked out 
 So we swerve in the glass house and we roll the street 
 I ran niggas rolling up on us and well up the heat 
 I said, What's up you plotted the wrong set 
 It's my duty to put my gun this nigga to rest 
 Boom, boom, shots from the tech ran out 
 Another enemy gone, that's what I'm talking about 
 Niggas draw my name out and say they going to kill me 
 I ain't worried about an damm thang, y'all niggas can't kill me 
 See my homies is killers and we do this for passion 
 You better get your strap, when you see us we blasting 
 We will run up on you nigga their ain't going to be no asking 
 You better get your strap when you see, we blasting 
 (C-Bo) 
 Their ain't no future in the front you bitches is straight hoes 
 Wish niggas want scramble with the foes 
 I peel his cap with the boom, boom 
 You niggas going die tonight, crip card going ride tonight 
 Niggas want to see roll the hardcore 
 Dump niggas in the sea 
 Many fourteen leave them slope in his front seat 
 Approach me I jump my magnum to your teeth 
 Hop out the bentley, sagging down to my knees 
 Screaming out thug life, throwing slugs in the air 
 Leaving in the mansion with no neighbors and don't care 
 Drinking Cristile out the bottles 
 To the life of luxury, stuck with me, we smoldered with models 
 I'm an thug nigga, wont die alone without taking an knife 
 And shoot an piggy in his face for his third strike 
 You cremate me or send me to jail 
 Don't give an fuck because I was born in hell 
 (Daz Dillinger) 
 And every where I go I see the same mother fuckers and I end up back in jail 
 (Hook: C-Bo) 
 (Chorus: C-Bo)
