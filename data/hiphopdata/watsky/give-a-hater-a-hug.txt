 Hey that's the city 
 Traffic's always shitty 
 If you can't kick it happily then dammit that's a pity 
 You don't even have to be some hackie-sacking hippie 
 For you to be relaxed and free like Janet Jackson's titty 
 So wave your freak flag 
 If they don't like it they're a D-bag 
 They deserve a tea-bag 
 If they want to be mad 
 You could give 'em knee pads 
 Tell them to S on your D or your V (Vag) 
 Maybe daddy was mean 
 Or they got the tiniest penis 
 Or the hater's gene 
 And you ended up in between it 
 And it seems that they're a little bit insecure 
 So they want you to feel smaller than an insect, sure sucks 
 When they hear what I recorded 
 And they wish I'd been aborted (wait, what?) 
 But it don't make me sore 
 I got to love them more

 I get a lot of people judging my 
 Stuff that I 
 Put into the public eye 
 I used to wonder why 
 So many people would say that I'm gay and I should just give up and die 
 Now I shove my pride 
 And all of that stuff aside, see 
 Most of these haters that be commenting on youtube 
 They respond with anger 'cause it's something that they're used to 
 Something in their childhood that left them with a lose screw 
 And the abase, we don't choose who raise us 
 No paced is given, photo the way that you living 
 So I just made a decision, that I say I forgive 'em 
 And give 'em a chance to make it in this unfavorable system 
 Before they do something crazy and shit in the name of religion 
 You saying you christened, but hate someone different from you 
 Ask yourself what the leader of your religion would do 
 Now roll up on a hater with some out-stretched arms 
 It ain't gonna do nobody no harm
