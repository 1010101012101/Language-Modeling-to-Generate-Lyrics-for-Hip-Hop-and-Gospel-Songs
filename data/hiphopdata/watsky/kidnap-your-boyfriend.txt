I was just thinking that I really like you 
 And I was just thinking that I really like you 
 And I was just thinking if I kidnap your boyfriend could I be your boyfriend? 
 I've gotta time it right I've gotta plan it through 
 You're a stick of dynamite hope that I can handle you 
 You're a whole new animal they couldn't hold a candle to 
 So I demand a candid answer, what's a man to do? 
 Could pay a camera crew, get an editor set up in his kitchen with the video and kid and put his ass on catch a predator 
 Call his creditor 
 Tell 'em he's in heavy debt and with fed on red alert I plant a care package, a bear trap with the teeth padded 
 And when he grabs it, then I beat it like brear rabbit 
 Or I could lock him in the liquor cabinet 
 Drinking, thinking of you, sad until he kicks the habit 
 And if he gets lovey dovey 
 I'll take the kindergarten keep him in the cubby 
 When we leave for winter break and someone gets the pet I'm gonna pawn him off on little betty like he was a guppy 
 I was just thinking that I really like you 
 And I was just thinking that I really like you 
 And I was just thinking if I kidnap your boyfriend could I be your boyfriend? 
 It's a minute to midnight and 
 That's my cue pull up in my big white van 
 Beckon him with my charisma 
 Chucking snickers at him like it's his Bar mitzvah 
 And if someone heard the racket better bet I'm gonna bag him in a burlap sack dude's whack, he lacks the X Factor (bookmark boy) I can be the next chapter/ (3 rising) what do I do for the women who tell me they want me? that when I got over the one who steadily haunts me if I get over the one then I'll be ready to party then I'll be looking at blondie, on me get up and calmly walk away it's pretty pathetic I get it, but not today you wanted to play you want me to act tough? spend every dime but I won't go bankrupt (3) I said to be easy could you please back up all these Jenga beezies they just don't stack up 
 I was just thinking that I really like you

 If I'm too blunt, I can mask it if time's a blunt, I can pass it I'd rather pass it with a passenger shotgun the messenger call off the massacre your dude is cool, I wish I didn't have to mess with him to tell the truth, I want the very second best for him I'm positive I'm not pessimist I'm not jumping, I'm just pissing off the precipice 
 If I deafen to the definition and I never getcha god I betcha I'll be better 'cause I metcha but be I'm missing always waiting for day you'll be available you keep on stating who you're dating ain't debatable but baby maybe we could pick up when this shit ends my sixth sense says we're clicking like we're bic pens and I don't wanna read the writing on the wall if it's only gonna end like annie hall
