Guys, I am absolutely thrilled to announce that 
 This band behind me and myself are going on tour 
 Uh, this is the first national tour of my life and it is 
 Absolutely just a dream come true 
 I love performing on YouTube, I love doing videos 
 But my heart and my soul is in live performance 
 And I can't wait to hit like 22 cities across America and London 
 We're hopping in a van and we're bringing the amazing Dumbfoundead on many of the dates 
 And it's just gonna be a great show, so tickets are on sale now 
 Buy 'em below, can't wait to rock out with you 
 I don't really give a damn about a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow 
 If it's being on a billboard 
 From the moment I saw Chali 2na rocking under the multi-colored lighting 
 In concert at the Fillmore 
 I'd kill for punks and b-girls 
 Never gonna matter I'll be spitting like a water cannon making waves I'm an orca 
 I recommend a parkas you'll be feeling like you're in the front row at Sea World 
 Gonna hike it till I make it, it's a good call 
 Taking the mic and I spike it like a football 
 Like a running back 
 Like I'm under the gun but I'm never gonna crack 
 Never could fall 
 It's like I'm Arnold I'm 
 Skinny but I'm picking up a barbell fine 
 Gonna make it putting my pen to the paper poppin' out a novel in a minute 
 Like I'm R.L. Stine 
 Gotta try because I got a fool's chance 
 Grab the mic up at a middle school dance 
 Take it from the DJ and I rap until they plug up out on me to stop it or until I get pantsed 
 Fuck it, they can pull the plug I'm gonna kick it acapella 
 Dockers at my ankles, and I tell 'em what I'm feeling 
 Even if nobody is listening I yell it to the ceiling 
 And I celebrate the fact that I'm alive and I'm breathing
