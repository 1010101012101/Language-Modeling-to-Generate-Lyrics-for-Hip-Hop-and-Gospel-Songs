Get in bed like I'm at war 
 Make your vagina more than kinda sore 
 I'm hung like a dinosaur 
 Shit, your hymen tore 
 You're busted, you never grew up like a Toys R Us Kid 
 I'm well adjusted like jock strap crotches 
 Bang my old teachers while the preschool watches 
 Met a slow girl, I was fucking her fast 
 Had some tight old pussy 
 And got stuck in the past 
 I molest old age, grab the best old babe in a breast hold babe 
 Is you chest cold, babe? 
 Are those boobs or goosebumps? 
 Hey, sugar tits, can a pimp have two lumps? 
 Measure my hard prick, whatever the night 
 I use my dick as a yardstick to measure my height 
 I'm healing myself 
 Got a hole in my pocket and I'm feeling myself 
 I'm like wu tang 
 Your art's cookie cutter like a Warhol soup can 
 The rapper who can destroy mere humans 
 Fuck your facelift 
 Fuck your played whip 
 I built a space ship to ride in while you're cruising earth 
 I'm owning all the aliens who emcee in the universe 
 The ten best rappers is a list of me 
 I exist to be the greatest rapper in history 
 Built a time machine from Flava's clock and a saddle 
 Taught Plato to rap and then kicked his ass in a battle 
 I'm best rapper alive 
 Who gets mistaken for michael cera 
 Everywhere that he drives 
 Fuck michael cera, you weren't so superbad 
 When I was riding you around rodeo yelling who's your dad?
