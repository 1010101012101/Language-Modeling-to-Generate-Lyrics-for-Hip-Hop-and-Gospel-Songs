It's a song about girl the next door 
 Love the girl next door 
 The world's next door 
 They see her- everybody melts 
 She's the girl next door to everybody everybody else 
 It's a song is a song about the girl who sings 
 And every time you hear her sing 
 She sings for you 
 And you alone 
 And every other guy you know 
 She loves you back 
 She says she's with it 
 Loves you back 
 But wait a minute 
 All along she loved ya back 
 Enough to put a dagger in it 
 (Cause) This is a song about girl the next door 
 I love the girl next door 
 The world's next door 
 They see her- everybody melts 
 She's the girl next door to everybody everybody else 
 It's like a fairy tale! 
 About little chickenhead 
 Thought the sky was falling 
 So she kicked it sick in bed 
 I came calling (she pretended she was dead) 
 Feeling she was healing but the ceiling fell instead! 
 You feel stellar in your skeleton? 
 Tell a guy you fell for him then tell him he's irrelevant? 
 It's evident you think you're helen of troy 
 But you're hell in a handbasket 
 Hell of a coy little cruella de vil 
 If it's fitting you fill in 
 Another filthy felony with every fella you thrill 
 You're cellophane 
 But there's a spell on us still 
 A man goes window shopping 
 And you sell him the sill 
 You give an illness that isn't a silly pill or some silvery penicillin 
 Or pity gonna fulfill and so willing my pen is spilling I'm drilling my point until 
 The pen point's dull 
 The end point's still 
 In sight, I'm inside, I'm insisting 
 Get wise and quit with lip synching 
 In Christ you entice the quick kissing 
 Rise in a bathtub full of ice with a rib missing 
 It's been decided 
 You can lie, but you can't hide it behind your eyelids 
 I provided rhymes and had to plan a hybrid 
 With the man that led this band who might have liked you more than I did 
 Or maybe as much 
 Cause baby that's what 
 Make me want to laugh 
 Just, breaks me right in half cause 
 It really adds up 
 Dwelling on this sad stuff 
 Cellibacy mad sucks 
 When everybody tapped once 
 Including a best friend 
 Then one of my roommates 
 You said it was just then 
 But shit it was too late 
 So what's your group rate 
 'Cause we've waiting our turn 
 To watch you eat your words 
 And catch some heartburn 
 (Here!) is where you would have sung the verse 
 (Here!) is where you'd have to catch you breath 
 (Here!) is where you might forget the words 
 (Haha) that where you'd laugh to fill the rest 
 (Here!) is where you'd hit another high note 
 (Here!) is where you'd make it pretty, shit if I don't 
 (Here!) is where we'd really try to be friends 
 Funny how the shallow girls end up off the deep end 
 (First) I met your ass last year 
 First day of class, you were mad sincere 
 (Then) you went and chose my friend for benefits 
 (Then) he did the same and said it was the end of it 
 (Then) funny thing, I got up on the TV 
 (Then) coincidentally you said you'd like to see me 
 (Then) you stood me up on just our second date 
 Out with mister music 
 (Then) you used him for a your serenade 
 It's a song about girl the next door 
 Love the girl next door 
 The world's next door 
 They see her- everybody melts 
 She's the girl next door to everybody everybody else 
 It's a song is a song about the girl who sings 
 And every time you hear her sing 
 She sings for you 
 And you alone 
 And every other guy you know 
 She loves you back 
 She says she's with it 
 Loves you back 
 But wait a minute 
 All along she loved ya back 
 Enough to put a dagger in it 
 (Cause) This is a song about girl the next door 
 I love the girl next door 
 The world's next door 
 They see her- everybody melts 
 She's the girl next door to everybody everybody else
