Yeah, I've been doing that 
 I've been doing that ever since I was in kindergarten 
 I've been doing that for a long long long long, long long long long long long time 
 Oh, when did it actually get really bad though? 
 I was turning the age I am right now 
 Which is how old? 
 Eight 
 Eight is a good year, eight is maybe the finest year 
 The only thing is that 
 The only problem with that is that you're getting closer to being ten 
 That's the real problem 
 You don't wanna turn ten? 
 I mean, I mean, that's the only problem with it 
 I mean you're like, you're being closer to ten every time you change in age 
 And when you're close to ten 
 It's all over 
 Yeah, you might not like the things you used to like, right? 
 I actually had probably the exact same fear when I was about to turn ten 
 But I'm gonna let you know right now you shouldn't worry 
 Because being ten is-is super rad 
 But the thing that would always make me feel better 
 Is my mom and dad would sit me down and do funny voices 
 And they would tell me a story and it would all go away
