I can't hear you (I got my headphones on) 
 I can't hear you (I got my headphones on) 
 I can't hear you (I got my headphones on) 
 I got headphones on (I got my headphones on) 
 When I look at who's around 
 And it feels like two's a crowd 
 I don't run and hide 
 I just smile real wide 
 And I turn my music loud 
 It's not practical to react to bull 
 I was thinking too hard and I cracked my skull 
 It's natural, erase all doubt 
 If I take my phones off, then my brains fall out 
 So you can shout, Empty out your throat on me 
 It just looks like you're lip synching Obla Di 
 Obla da, every time you go, "blah blah 
 Blah" I'm hearing "life goes on" like it's your mantra 
 So talk shit, but when it's prone to go down 
 You're afraid of your own bull like rodeo clowns 
 I stay low to the ground, I stay plugged in 
 And when my dome needs love, phones hug my skin 
 But Earbuds don't count, they're headphone loopholes 
 I want 'em bigger than a couple sideways soup bowls 
 And if you're saying next to nothing 
 Make like my playlist and get to shufflin' 
 I can't hear you (I got my headphones on) 
 I can't hear you (I got my headphones on) 
 I can't hear you (I got my headphones on) 
 I got headphones on (I got my headphones on) 
 When I look at who's around 
 And it feels like two's a crowd 
 I don't run and hide 
 I just smile real wide 
 And I turn my music loud 
 I get up, when you get down to this 
 Keep cool, but still get loud to this 
 When it drops just can't deny 
 The mic's turned off but I'm amplified 
 So if you want to ride 
 This young son will come out tonight 
 And this one tongue will give out the vibe 
 With this mic off I'm still amplified (amplified) 
 We don't just write poems, we got a mic jones (Mike Jones!) 
 Giving a fuck, ripping it up in different time zones 
 I know it's so apropos that it's gotta be said 
 That I was flowing so hard in the car off the top of my head 
 When I drove home That my own flows gave me road dome 
 So go bone man but fuck it if you're celibate 
 Screw the music if you do it 'cause you're selling it well equipped, man 
 We do it for the hell of it, never delicate hella ripped off the elements 
 Earth wind fire water top rock echo box 
 Yo man we got Cosby doing jello shots 
 I've been tellin' 'em the melanin's irrelevant 
 I'm yellin' and you'll feel it from the ceiling to the sediment 
 Intelligent epic and reppin' the Bay you're tripping 
 If you're thinking that you're getting away, because 
 I can't hear you (I got my headphones on) 
 I can't hear you (I got my headphones on) 
 I can't hear you (I got my headphones on) 
 I got headphones on (I got my headphones on) 
 When I look at who's around 
 And it feels like two's a crowd 
 I don't run and hide 
 I just smile real wide 
 And I turn my music loud 
 The sun is coming up and running through me 
 If weather is getting better, don't be gloomy 
 Let's get together, gather up and get it moving and 
 If you don't like my motherfuckin music, sue me 
 A new me, a new reason to be, So unseasonably fine 
 The ill summer grill serving supper with free sides cut to the 'B' side 
 It's Watsky covered in batter and butter and refried 
 The speakers are pushing the roof the tweeters the woofers are proof 
 The meters are up in the booth the subs 
 The mids, the highs, the highers, the lows 
 The cones all bump duh we're amped 
 That's the god damn truth we flowing low in this moment 
 Only to sew and be growing over the roses 
 And now that we broke it open we know that we're dope enough 
 We're hoping no one just can't get live 
 This is how we get amplified 
 I can't hear you (I got my headphones on) 
 I can't hear you (I got my headphones on) 
 I can't hear you (I got my headphones on) 
 I got headphones on (I got my headphones on) 
 When I look at who's around 
 And it feels like two's a crowd 
 I don't run and hide 
 I just smile real wide 
 And I turn my music loud
