I'll be gone when you read this so I just wanted to say 
 I'm sorry to the couple decent people who got in the way 
 And maybe there was a point at which it all coulda been different 
 But this is the position we're in and it's pointless to wish that it isn't 
 You'll all be gawking when I walk in the door 
 Cocking my shotgun hammer and you drop to the floor 
 The clocks shatter I scatter the jock horde and splatter the chalkboard 
 It matters a lot more, than half of you thought 
 When you were knocking me like I'm a laughingstock 
 And a weakling a freak and creep, I was mocked and ignored 
 You're sorry now but talk is cheap - shoulda thought it before 
 You're the sorry flock of sheep who made me rot to core 
 And of course you'll make a break to escape through the corridor 
 Don't be late - I'm tryna arrange a date with the coroner 
 And our fate's are sealed, all you fakes 
 Don't worry this will all be over soon 
 You got your finger on the trigger, kid 
 You got your finger on the trigger, kid 
 Line it up, line it up, line it up 
 And hit me with the truth 
 Thanks for tuning into the top-rated crew in the news 
 Feels great to us that we're the one that viewers would choose! 
 I'm hearing through my producer 
 We've got the scoop on the name and the favorite food of the shooter 
 Plus an interview with a student 
 Who's been fed through a tube - she was shot in the head 
 We're gonna bring you a segment live from her hospital bed! 
 We'll try to bring you the spin through your preexisting opinions 
 But if we miss it switch it to our sister network instead 
 Of course we know this situation is tragic 
 But take a minute to appreciate our fabulous graphics 
 And we'll be back in action with up to the second reports 
 After a couple of words from all our loyal sponsors of course 
 So like us, vine us, and tweet to connect 
 24/7 we're giving ya what you're craving 
 We live to deliver live the kinda coverage you've come to expect 
 We're always here for you 
 We come together in this hour of need 
 To the honor the innocent victims of this cowardly deed 
 Of course I share your sentiment as your voice in the senate 
 But let's accept nothing ever could have been done to prevent it 
 It's just the strange inner visions of a deranged individual 
 Full of rage, full of hate, full of vitriol 
 But I gotta mention that it's sick and insane 
 My opponent's twisting your pain for political gain 
 That's lame 
 And I think it's a damn shame 
 It doesn't give anyone power to cast blame 
 Because the past is past, and it's best that we keep things the same 
 So my Chads and my Stacey's, go back to the mall 
 Fill your bags up at Macy's, and chat in the hall 
 And I hope I'm the vote that you cast in the fall 
 'Cause I care for you, it's true 
 Stick to your guns 
 Stick to your guns 
 Stick to your guns 
 Stick to your guns
