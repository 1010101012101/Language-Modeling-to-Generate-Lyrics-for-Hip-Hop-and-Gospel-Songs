My head's up in the sky it's higher than the clouds are 
 I like to look up at the stars and wonder how far 
 From what I hear about a billion babies are delivered every day and so it's like the planet is a clown car 
 I know it probably shouldn't work, but we all fit 
 Like a Mcy D's Playplace ballpit 
 So lookie me, I'm about to jump up in it swimming through syringes like a mothafuckin dolphin 
 I might have an outburst 
 There's a lot of freaky people on the planet and it makes me want to crowd surf 
 Everybody everywhere dig downwards 
 It's what we work for 
 Party at the earth's core! 
 I don't where to go to go far 
 But if if I go, then I know I should go hard 
 And if I go and I never come back 
 Then I'll send a postcard 
 And a couple thumb tacks 
 Teacher said this party started with a loud bang 
 The way my ears are ringing I don't hear a sound mang 
 I'm steady looking at the crowd like a proud dad 
 For coming out instead of clicking like a mouse pad 
 Steal a bounce house, fill it full of helium 
 Ride like a blimp because I think It'd be really fun 
 To do a triple flip in zero gravity while puffing on a philly blunt and shooting stars with a BB gun 
 Tonight I'll look at something that I've never seen before 
 And I might even pen graffitti on a meteor 
 I can reach it, homie veni vidi vicci it's all peachy got a vision of the future on a wigi board 
 I didn't believe it, I 
 Thought it CGI 
 Why don't you decide 
 If we're computerized? 
 Assuming you and I are alive 
 And tomorrow is the rapture 
 I wonder watcha wanna do tonight 
 I don't wanna I don't wanna I don't wanna 
 I don't I don't wanna end up as an anybody 
 Everybody is anybody 
 Made of arteries and antibodies 
 And you never get to see confetti without getting bloody 
 If you read ahead you'll all be surprised 
 Spoiler alert! 
 We're all gonna die 
 But I'll be hooping in that driveway in the clouds 
 Shooting fouls with that big orange ball in the sky 
 And when I die wanna say well I made it 
 And be way celebrated 
 And remain as a staple 
 If I stay hella faded 
 Then I'll fade and my fate'll be the same as the fakers with the chains on the labels 
 It's a shame people do it for the fame and the cash and not the flame and the passion I train through the pain and I frame every passage as way to stay fit 
 Cause an 808 kick is my gatorade drink
