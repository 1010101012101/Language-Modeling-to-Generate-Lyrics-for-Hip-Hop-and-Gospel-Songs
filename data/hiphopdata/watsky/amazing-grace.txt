I used to think I was a marxist, 
 Now I go to less marches 
 It's not that I don't want to start shit 
 But I don't want to start shit 
 Unless it's where my heart sits 
 I don't keep a knife under my seat 
 To join the revolution and spill blood in the street 
 I'd rather have a discussion over a bottle of bud or a puff on a blunt and then get something to eat 
 I used to ask strangers if they believed in a God 
 To see if we were peas in a pod 
 And if they didn't agree with me then I'd argue and try to be smarter thinking I'd hear people applaud 
 But 
 I'm getting older 
 And I'm getting dumber 
 Or least I know less than I did when I was younger 
 I used to profess, now I'm more pro-wonder 
 I used to fear death, now I'm set to go under 
 No, fuck it, I still fear 
 This life is too top tear 
 And it's like we just got here 
 We're more than an oozie on a navy plane 
 Or lazy susan cruising on the gravy train 
 We're the tingle up your neck 
 When you see the sunset filter through the dust as it settles on the waves of grain 
 Yes, the waves of grain on the stolen land 
 Theft is as American as a Cola can 
 Yeah, it was sold to sam 
 Tell it to the mother of a little girl 
 On the trail of tears as she holds her hand 
 Dammit, this was built on something ugly 
 But with all my heart, man I believe in this country 
 The beauty of our constitution 
 Have you read it lately? I swear It's really pretty lovely 
 It's really splendid 
 It's like our forefathers penned it 
 Inspired, some early eminem shit 
 It's like they meant it 
 It's like they dreampt that all the fences that divide us would eventually be mended 
 Or rather torn down 
 So I don't think it's un-American at all for us to ask for even more now 
 Let's talk it over over more rounds 
 What do you say?
