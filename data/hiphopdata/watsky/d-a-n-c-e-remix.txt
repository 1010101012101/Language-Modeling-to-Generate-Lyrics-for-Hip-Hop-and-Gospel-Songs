6th grade, I remember my first dance 
 Steady searching through the mix for a slow dance 
 Like the marshmallow pieces in the Lucky Charms 
 'Cause that's golden your opportunity for romance 
 But on the fast songs the numbers between 
 That's when you get to show the lovely ladies what you mean 
 It's when the fella's preen watch me C-Walk 
 How I strutted and displayed feathers like a peacock 
 They did the Funky Chicken, I learned the Dirty Bird, 
 'Cause the Atlanta Falcons did it in the end zone 
 After every touchdown 
 It didn't help me score, did it at the dances 
 And it put me in the friend zone 
 And if I went home, with my head down 
 I lift my chin up 
 Then put it down again 
 Up again 
 Down again 
 Up again 
 Down again 
 Now I'm headbanging to the brand new sound again 
 Your body is a temple 
 My body is a circus ring trying to hold itself up like a tentpole 
 Every instrumental makes my pencil neck 
 Snap back fast until I'm going mental 
 Some call it grinding, some call it bumping 
 But in the Bay we had a funny way of speaking 
 In San Francisco, we're the kids of hippies 
 Just a bunch of geeks so we called it freaking 
 In 6th grade, freaked with a 8th hottie 
 Named Janny and I sang Kumbaya Amen Hallelujah! 
 Until a hater chaperone came and made room for God 
 It's all good though 
 Turn the anger into energy and passion till I'm burning like a wood stove 
 I do Liquid and the Fireball 
 The only raver moves I know 
 But I'm putting on a good show
