God told me himself, no weapon formed against me shall prosper

 Let me say 
 Bitch, who you trying to act a fool with 
 I pack my own bag, got my own bowling ball and my own pool stick 
 I'm live in big bear, bitch

 The tripping care and I raised 'em up 
 I don't give a fuck about bitch 
 Niggas, you can have that bitch 
 Packapack a stop sign green light yellow light 
 In the train dipping down in the morning all that night 
 Am I scaring you nigga? 
 You know black tongue, the mothafucka turned aroung and leave me alone 
 Nigga, I ain't scared when I'm home alone

 Kicking back like that, he on the gang, he on the trigger 
 Big Demen pool tables when he weed smoke

 My Mama said, "Dejuan, why you talk about women like that?" 
 I said, "Cause a bitch took my son from me and didn't bring him back" 
 So this for you, fuck you, your Mama your grandmama and her mama's mama too

 Bitch, I'm going my own way, I don't wanna be witch you 
 And what don't you do

 But you're too two-faced to talk about it 
 Ugh, you got to get up and take a walk about it
