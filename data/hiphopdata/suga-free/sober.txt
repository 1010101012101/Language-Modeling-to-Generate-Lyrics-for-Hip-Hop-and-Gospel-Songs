The city is glamming 
 In the spot coming from my Gucci lenses 
 Plus tour buses scoops and Benzes 
 I ain't used to this I came through the trenches 
 Now my cousin fill up on boots and end em 
 Said I can't pronounce multiple bank accounts 
 Now I get my homies and my hemmys down 
 Shit I used to get a hundred bucks a show 
 Now I get a couple grand to come and stand around 
 And drink shots of crown but never snitched to real 
 One too many gotta catch some air 
 Rooftop parties bars everywhere 
 But success don't rest out of hair corvair 
 Big rozay hoe's day when I come and show them 
 This the me I get 'em tipsy freeze 
 Be going both ways pussy lickers skills that go showcase 
 Late night bunch of hoes at my doorway 
 It's 4 in the morning and the party don't end 
 Baby come over, baby come over 
 Our clothes on the ground drinking crown till we spin 
 Fuck till we're sober 
 Two fucker take a break to take a shot 
 Restaurant closed so we go in 
 Have my Iphone out making homemade porn 
 And she screaming oh Lord, like she born again 
 One of us going down on snorkeling 
 Walk by my hotel room door and 
 I'm sure you hear us bone and probably came the moment 
 And fuck a maid keeping knocking reorienting 
 She give me oral then I told her you're a 10 
 Blind 'cause you really bout eaten a half 
 But a head game is the greatest I had 
 It's a damn shame that I'm singing the last 
 Bet it was a blast she was making the splash 
 And I got one more favor to ask 
 Can I put a lil' bit cocaine on your ass 
 I took a sniff and I told the bitch slider ass 
 It's 4 in the morning and the party don't end 
 Baby come over, baby come over 
 Our clothes on the ground drinking crown till we spin 
 Fuck till we're sober 
 I'm feeling like a rabbit coming out of the egg 
 Feeling like a motherfucker breaking down record my tool 
 The nervous nigga with a flat on glove 
 Hella body with a bounce this is pimpin' hoe 
 Pow, vroom! shake with a fine grim 
 And both out to shine like a barn bill 
 I'm too cool don't I walk like I got it all down to a science fiction 
 Kinda like domino's pizza 
 And don't get too comfortable in the morning, 
 Money always feel better than sex to me 
 The trick if I pick it up and ask for free 
 Motherfucker flamboyant 
 When I walked on the snow baby 
 And the sound of shy day fills the room with jamma bitch which fills my pocket 
 I like to wiggle wiggle it more I'm a hussler 
 Walk around pimpin' I don't touch 'em 
 I thought you knew that pimps don't go to jail 
 For pimpin', they go for mispimpin' 
 So don't do that, 
 And understand God made pimps so a hoe can have a man 
 A trip won't understand 
 Suga Free, my man! 
 It's 4 in the morning and the party don't end 
 Baby come over, baby come over 
 Our clothes on the ground drinking crown till we spin 
 Fuck till we're sober
