 Yeah nigga!... 
 You know!... 
 That's right!... 
 Yeah baby!... That's how we do it... 
 Hahaha... hahahah... 
 Follow me tell me if you feel me! 
 I think niggas is tryin' to kill me 
 Picturin' pistols 
 Spittin' hollow points till they drill me 
 Keepin' it real 
 And even if I do conceal my criminal thoughts 
 Preoccupied with keepin' steels... see niggas is false 
 Sittin' in court 
 Turned snitches that used to be real 
 But now they petrified bitches I'm tryin' to be strong 
 They sendind' armies out to bomb me 
 Listen to Ron 
 The only DJ that could calm me 
 Constantly armed 
 My firepower keep me warm 
 I'm trapped in the storm 
 And fuck the world till I'm gone 
 Bitches be warned 
 Word is born you'll get torn 
 I'm bustin' on Juliani he rubbin my niggas' wrong 
 And then it's on 
 Before I leave 
 Picture me 
 I'm spittin' at punk bitches and hustlin' to be free 
 Watch me set it 
 Niggas don't want it 
 You can get it 
 Bet it... make these jealous niggas mad I said it 
 This' Thug Life nigga we don't cater to you hoes 
 Fuck with me... have a hundred mothafuckas at your door 
 With 4.4s 
 Yeah nigga!... 
 Thug Life!... 
 Big L 
 I be that young shorty, fly, smoothe, glorious kid 
 A Bad Boy just like Notorious B.I.G 
 A Rockafella like Sean Carter 
 With more game than Ron Harper 
 The bomb sparker, rapper, slash armed robber 
 While y'all be on the corner bummy' and high 
 I be out... buyin' the finest shit money can buy 
 You wish you was in the position that I'm in 
 Hot rhymin' 
 Diamonds shinin' 
 Autograph signin' 
 My lifestyle is far out 
 Every week bring a different car out 
 I go to night clubs and buy the bar out... uh... 
 'Cause I keep clean 
 I'm large on the street scene 
 Every time I touch mics you hear all the freaks scream 
 Yeah!...Yeah!... Big L 
 Harlem's finest 
 The nigga who hold it down from uptown 
 2PAC

 Deadly combination boa'!...
