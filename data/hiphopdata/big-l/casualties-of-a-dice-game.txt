(Big l) 
 It's flamboyant y'all 
 Yeah, yeah yeah, corleone y'all 
 Me and my man was cruisin through the streets and everything was flowin nice 
 The corner's crowded, niggaz must be rollin' dice 
 I parked the ride so my nigga iroc can crash the lye spot 
 And I'ma gamble until he come back - why not? 
 Click-clack, cock the gat back, gotta be strapped 
 The game was mad packed, mad cats pockets was fat 
 They playin' cee-lo, my dick get hard when I see dough 
 I bets nothin' less than a g yo, you know my steelo 
 First I was losin then I started throwin' headcrack 
 After headcrack, got my bread back, jumped in my red ac' 
 I'm waitin for my nigga to come out of the spot 
 I see niggaz startin to plot, and I'm far from my block 
 Finally he walked out, told him, 'hop the fuck in' 
 On my face he saw the grin and said, 'how much did you win? ' 
 I estimated about, 45 maybe 50 g's 
 My man was hungry so I dropped him off at mickey d's 
 Now I'm alone, headin home to rest my dome 
 Spotted some niggaz trailin so I picked up the phone 
 Called bones, I said, 'yo son, I'm on the run 
 Need your help before I get done 
 Meet me downstairs, bring your big gun' 
 I don't believe this, this nigga said he can't make it 
 Cause some bitch is in his house butt-naked 
 And then he hung up 
 And this supposed to be my man and he don't give a fuck 
 That duck sold me out just to get a nut, what? 
 I'm cruisin fast and they still behind me 
 The same nigga who I won the money from, and his grimy crimey 
 It's about to get, real hasty 
 Grabbed the steel, took it off safety 
 'Cause I refuse to let these niggaz waste me 
 I started to cruise fast, then stopped short and made 'em crash 
 And now them fags is all bloody from the shattered glass 
 And one of them had passed, when his face smashed the dash 
 I was injured too, leakin with a deep gash 
 I ain't panicked, I was quite calm 
 Couldn't use the right arm, so I grabbed the gat with the left 
 Walked up to the car the creep was stuck in the seat 
 Looked at him, shook my head then started buckin my heat 
 It's over now, cause both of these motherfuckers asleep 
 I think I'm dyin', I'm feelin' weak out on my feet 
 But before I got some medical help, I had to catch a cab first 
 To one-forty-first and bradhurst 
 That's where bones live, walked in the buildin, staggerin 
 Lookin' tore down, shot his door down and beat his whore down 
 From the look in my eye, he knew he would die 
 Started to cry, stuck the gat to his head and said, 'why? ' 
 Then he offered me, all of his cheese 
 Then dropped to his knees and begged me please not to squeeze 
 Then his brains got blast out, he's ass-out, then I dashed out 
 Into the streets covered with blood, about to pass out 
 The hospital's up, a couple of blocks, I'm on my way but 
 Damn, here comes a couple of cops; I pulled out 
 And started blowin' they started blowin' back I'm goin' all out 
 I ain't holdin' back, I been to jail once and I ain't goin' back 
 I kept shootin, one shot caught a cop dead in his top 
 The other pig ducked behind a big truck 
 I was bleedin real bad, and couldn't stop it 
 But still had the fifty thou' profit in my pockets 
 The coast was clear, so I jetted to a park that was near 
 Seen kids playin' everywhere then threw the cash in the air 
 I watched all of them, run for they share 
 And all I can do was stare 
 I got weak and fell on my rear 
 Now I can hear the sirens, that means here comes the jakes 
 But it's too late, I'm knockin' on the pearly gates 
 Yeah, casualties of a dice game 
 Never gamble with snakes 
 Let that be a lesson to ya 
 Yeah, it's corleone y'all 
 Yeah, it's flamboyant y'all 
 Big l y'all, flamboyant baby, yeah 
 Big l... uh 
 Big l... yeah, it's flamboyant y'all, yeah
