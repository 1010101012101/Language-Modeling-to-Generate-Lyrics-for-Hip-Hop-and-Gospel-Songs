(Malcolm X) 
 Stealing runs rampant in Harlem 
 Gambling runs rampant in Harlem 
 All types of evils and uh, vices that terrified our community 
 Run rampant in Harlem 
 (Big L) 
 The microphone is through when this rap legend grab it 
 Sending poems to have them faggots digging hoes like Reverend Swaggart 
 L's the nigga that crime follows 
 I'm hitting fine models and stabbing punks with broken wine bottles 
 I beat chumps till they head splits, then break 'em like breadsticks 
 I sex chicks, I'll even fuck a dead bitch 
 Always spraying Tecs, because I be staying vexed 
 Some nigga named Dex, was in the projects laying threats 
 I jumped out the Lincoln, left him stinking 
 Put his brains in the street, now you can see what he was just thinking 
 I'm choking enemies till they start turning pale 
 Satan said I'm learning well, Big L's gonna burn in Hell 
 Front and get scarred cause your rap style ain't even hard 
 I run with a thieving squad, and none of us believe in God 
 Chorus: McGruff, Big L 
 (McG) Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the Danger Zone 
 (Big) Where no man can withstand or hold his own 
 (Big) Cause one-three-nine and Lennox is the Danger Zone 
 (McG) Where no man can withstand or hold his own 
 (Big L) 
 I got styles you can't copy bitch, it's the triple six 
 In the mix, straight from H-E-double-hockey sticks 
 Every Sunday, a nun lay from my gun spray 
 Fuck Carlito, we doing shit the Devil Son's Way 
 Every minute, my style switches up, they said a real man 
 Won't hit a girl well I ain't real 'cause I beat bitches up 
 I use words that's ill, L got nerves of steel 
 I'm cool, but every now and then I get a urge to kill 
 I'm taking lives for a great price, I'm the type 
 To snap in heaven with a Mac-11 and rape Christ 
 And I'm fast to put a cap in a fag chest 
 The Big L smash stress, cause hell is my address 
 I'm on some satanic shit, strictly, little kids 
 Be waking up crying, yelling, "Mommy Big L is coming to get me!" 
 (Big L) 
 I keep a cutie with a soft booty, hoes be running up 
 "Can I get your autograph L?" No bitch, I'm off duty 
 I'm breaking hottie hearts, niggaz drop when my shotty sparks 
 It ain't no food in my fridge; just body parts 
 I keep the gear fresh, I keep the braids rugged 
 I never wear rubbers bitch, if I get AIDS, fuck it! 
 A beef with me, you better prevent it cause in a minute 
 I'll jump out a tenant rented, and leave a nigga body dented 
 And my swoll knob your main girl cold slobbed 
 And gave a blow job to my whole mob, with no prob' 
 Aiyo crazy bitches slept with L 
 Then they niggaz got mad and tried to step to L 
 But I'm sicker than a nigga that's in Special Ed so I suggest 
 You spread pretzelhead, 'fore I turn your white sweatsuit red
