(Big L) 
 Aiyyo spark up the phillies and pass the stout 
 Making quick money grip before your ass is out 
 In a street brawl, I strike men quicker than lightnin 
 You seen what happened in my last fight friend? Aight then 
 L's a clever threat, a lyricist who never sweat 
 Comparing yourself to me is like a Benz to a chevrolette 
 And clown rappers I'm bound to slay 
 I'm saying hi to all the cuties from around the way 
 Yeah, 'cause I got all of them sprung Jack 
 My girls are like boomer-rangs 
 No matter how far I throw them, they come back 
 I'm coming straight out the N.Y.C 
 I'm down with diggin in the crates 
 And I'm M.V.P. yeah 
 (Chorus: repeat 4X) 
 If rap was a game I'll be M.V.P 
 The most valuable poet on the M.I.C 
 (Big L) 
 Yo it's a must that I get papes 
 Peace to all the DJ's who gave me love on they mix tapes 
 And once again the man's back with a drenged track 
 So here's your chance jack to get loose and let your hands clap 
 I got juice like boco, mad crews I broke through 
 Niggas be getting mad 'cause I hit more chicks than they spoke to 
 And every time I'm in a jam I always find a loophole 
 I got a crime record longer than Manute Bol 
 And my raps is unbelievable like aliens and flying saucers 
 No more iron horses 'cause I'm buying Porsches 
 I'm coming straight out the NYC peace to the Kid Capri, I'm M.V.P 
 (Big L) 
 Battles I lose none I make crews run 
 I get fools done, got ten fingers but only use one 
 My run is like Machine Gun Kelly, with a black skully 
 Put one in your belly, leave you smelly, then take your Pelle Pelle 
 I'm the neighborhood lampor, punani vamper, mess around you'll find 
 My silkboxers in your mommy's hamper 
 And nowadays girls want you for your money 
 I'm like Hev, I got nothing but love for you honey 
 And yes I'm living slick and my pockets are thick 
 I need surgery to get chicks removed from my (chill) 
 I'm coming straight out the N.Y.C., raps my J.O.B., and I'm M.V.P
