Verse One: 
 Let me get to the point real quick, when ya pockets are thick 
 Mad chicks be on a brothers tip 
 When ya sporting jewels and driving in a groovy car 
 All the ho's go sweat you like a movie star 
 To get in ya pockets, that's what the girls wanna do 
 But if you not rich them chicks gonna front on you 
 No matter how strong your rap 
 You only nock boots when you got loot and your on the map 
 'Cause if you broke you'll get a wack slut 
 If you got dough you get a ho with a fat butt 
 With fresh gear, long hair and a cute face 
 And if ya live alone she's gonna pack her suit case 
 And move in then ya start losing all ya bucks 
 Soon your brothers a joke a not a rut? 
 Then she takes off and brakes off ya ho's gone, so long dear 
 I'm outta here a good relationships been torn 
 'Cause when you on top everything's OK 
 But when you broke you get no play 
 If you don't got endz you won't be gettin' no skinz 
 And if you don't got money you won't skoop a honey 
 If you don't got cash you won't be gettin' no ass 
 And if your not clocking loot you won't be knockin' no boots 
 Verse Two: 
 Girls of the 90's ain't nothing but crooks 
 It's all about what's in ya pockets not how ya look 
 That's why you can't talk to just any whore 
 Leaving brothers for the next man 'cause he's got a penny more 
 They want a drug dealer not a scholar 
 Some girls barely speak but always asking for a dollar 
 And if you pushing a fresh Benz they'll be ya best friends 
 Yeah, as long as you collect ends 
 You think she's all yours, but as soon as your dough go 
 Your ho go, now you solo 
 But when you was makin' papers sucker jumped ho's 
 You bought dumb clothes for all of them bum ho's 
 And you was taking 'em to the movies every weekend 
 Now that you dead broke the girls not speaking 
 Cause nowadays girls want you to crook 
 The only thing they can get from Big L is a big... 
 'Cause when you on top everything's OK 
 But when you broke you gets no play 
 Verse Three: 
 I tell it how it is 'cause I'm a goldfigga 
 And I hate a money hungry girl a.k.a. golddigger 
 It ain't even funny 
 Some girls don't even know me asking me can they get some money 
 I'm looking nothing like ya poppa 
 I wouldn't give a chick 10 cent to put cheese on a Whopper 
 They wanna know why I'm so fly 
 A girl ask me for a ring and I put one around her whole eye 
 Chicks used to diss but now they wanna kiss 
 Yo Showbiz I'ma break it down like this 
 It's like that y'all, and that's a fact y'all 
 I hit hoes from the back and don't give a jack y'all 
 It's Big L y'all, I'm livin' swell y'all 
 I do my famous, spell my name, ring bells y'all 
 (If you don't got endz) 
 Girls be frontin 
 (If you don't got endz) 
 They ain't givin' up nothin' 
 (If you don't got endz) 
 All the girls they ignore you 
 (If you don't got endz) 
 They act like they never saw you 
 (If you don't got endz)...
