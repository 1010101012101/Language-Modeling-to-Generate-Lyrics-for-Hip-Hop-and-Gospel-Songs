Yo 
 My crew is in the house 
 Terra, herb mcgruff, buddah bless 
 Big twan, killa kam, trooper j, and mike boogie 
 And ima set it like this 
 Big l 
 Aiyo, folks who quote what I wrote get choked 
 You better surrender before you get smoked 
 You niggas be thinkin' this kid is a joke? 
 I put chumps to rest fast, when my smith-wes blast 
 So just dash or trespass and get your chest smashed 
 Rap new york rules, I sport jewels and extort crews 
 Don't get me pissed, I got a short fuse 
 I go bezerk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk 
 So stay alert, no smoke, cause these knuckles hurt 
 I'm from the alley, not the valley 
 I'm hotter than cali, wicked like harry 
 And fuck sally, I rather marry halle 
 I revive crowds with live styles 
 Don't hang with jive pals 
 Adios, ghost, I'm 5 thous 
 Terra 
 Well, I'm flav, and I was down with the crime wave 
 Now its time saved, yo, cause now I'm a rhyme slave 
 In 87 I sold cracks, collected some dough stacks 
 Hold gats, a joker got his soul taxed 
 N.o. rated, rappers you no-made it 
 Tell the terra to rotate it, his raps are gold-plated 
 This nigga terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter 
 Ass brother, I leave your rhyme trash gutter 
 I'm more rare, the MC in this warfare 
 Put you in a morgue where it's too late for that lord prayer 
 Power struck, terra drops the follow-up 
 Sour luck, niggas got and popped and swallow nuts 
 Herb mcgruff 
 For those that don't know, yo, I'm herb mcgruff 
 I'm on some murder stuff 
 And when I talk every verb is rough 
 Front on this and get beat bad 
 With big bats that bruise, break bones 
 Then wind up bloody in a bodybag 
 Mcs are live, but I'm mad liver 
 Aiyo, my rhymes are more funky than an African cab driver 
 Step to this and get sliced with ease 
 Ate up like rice and peas 
 (Herb, can you fight?) yo, I'm nice with these 
 Ask the nigga in my last bout 
 He thought I just was on some gun shit, I had to knock his ass out 
 Microphones I gotta tear 
 Peace to big l, straight from hell 
 I'm the fuck up outta here 
 Buddha bless 
 Aiyo, its time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic 
 Herb passed it, now I melt the mic like its plastic 
 I rag crews 'cause I'm bad news 
 In a mad move I'm servin' brothers quicker than fast food 
 Step to this and get your body blown 
 'Cause I'm a known medigan for poems I slide the hotties home 
 Heres some advice, I'm mad nice 
 Aiyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice 
 And cold take a fags life 
 My swellin melon got niggas jealin 
 Aiyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin' niggas lives like a felon 
 Big twan 
 Yo, I bust chumps like a glock 10, when I drops in 
 The top ten is rocked when its locked in 
 I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow 
 Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill the show 
 I got lines that's deeper than a jail 
 Been no frail, kids get nailed and read braille when they fail 
 Yeah, ain't I nasty, too nasty to trash me 
 Bash me, aiyo, that's dead, so don't ask me 
 You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off 
 I never come soft, I gotta pump that sawed-off 
 And when I let slugs out, you will get rugged out 
 For dissin, you come up missin' like a cup scout 
 Killa kam 
 Rappers be funny like flesh, 'cause they sections 80 slaughter, son 
 Talk about nines and tecs, and never shot a watergun 
 But killa kam, I get erratic when it comes to static 
 There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic 
 Increase the peace that cease cause once I release 
 My crew from the east, we leavin' at least 
 20 police deceased, it's the beast on attack 
 So make tracks, I break backs 
 I jack with def gats and black macs 
 On lennox ave. ain't no light looks, you fight crooks 
 Left and right hooks, if you front, get your life took 
 Trooper j 
 I'm havin' nail-sharp pains in my brain like a hellraiser 
 I'm blazin' trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer 
 Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin' but lead 
 Boom-bye-bye, dem find another batty bwoy dead 
 In backyard alleys, but I call 'em crackyard valleys 
 And I pack more rallys than riots back in cali 
 And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse 
 I'm in a daze and I'm so confused 
 >From seein heads shake so many times the lead make 
 And mike boogies next up, and keep my head straight 
 Mike boogie 
 I should never rhyme cause every time I step into a contest 
 Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat 
 'Cause they know when I start droppin' poems 
 That I be knockin' domes, poppin' bones and sendin niggas hoppin home 
 Word to god, its kinda hard for a fag to touch this 
 So if you're comin' to see me, nigga, bring a cask and crutches 
 And niggas, I don't need a gun for you, none of you 
 'Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my no. 2 
 And its death in every paragraph 
 And niggas learn when I burn they muthafuckin ass to ash 
 No need to question am I nice, 'cause it's a fact, friend 
 I shoot the gift like santa clause with a mac-10 
 And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed 
 And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for mike 
 Now I'm bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin' it tough 
 Peace to big l, aiyo, 8 is enough 
 True, true 
 And before I get up outta here 
 I gotta say peace to d-whiz and short man 
 Brothers that was there since the beginning 
 What's up to rockin' wheel from the hard pack crew 
 Peace to mase murder and the b.b.o. crew 
 The best out crew, the m&m crew 
 And all the other crews that's representin in harlem 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 And last but not least 
 I gotta say peace to the 139th street nfl crew 
 My crew 
 Word up
