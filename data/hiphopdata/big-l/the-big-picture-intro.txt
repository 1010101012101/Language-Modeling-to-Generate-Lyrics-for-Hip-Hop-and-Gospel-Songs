 (Big l) 
 Yo; you know the game plan 
 C-town, that's my main man 
 We never bring luggage, we go shoppin' when the plane lands 
 Still run with the same clan, used to be a kane fan 
 ("Mmm, mmm, mm..") everything I rock is name brand 
 L'll make ya dame swallow 
 Your ice don't shine and your chain hollow 
 While you front in clubs for hours with the same bottle 
 Takin' midget sips, I run with the richest clicks 
 Tap the thickest chicks, plus drop the slickest hits 
 You know nuttin about l, so don't doubt l 
 What's this motherfuckin rap game without l? 
 Yo, that's like jewels without ice 
 That's like china without rice 
 Or the holy Bible without Christ 
 Or the bulls without mike 
 Or crackheads without pipes 
 The village without dykes 
 Or hockey games without fights 
 Don't touch the mic if you unable to spit 
 Flamboyant is the label I'm with, motherfucker
