Juke 
 She's a freak. 
 I say let your flag fly, 
 They crownin' me king like I was prince, 
 And then my dad died. 
 I'm a bad guy, 
 I bet she heard that shit from you, 
 'Cause you tell her what you feeling, 
 Even if that shit ain't true, 
 That's why you always in some drama, 
 Guess you think it's kind of cool, 
 To be the center of attention, 
 All the mentions about you, 
 Word to my tattoos, 
 I'll be long gone. 
 Getting slow dome 
 Listening to my own song. 
 I'm trying to live green, 
 I guess that's why I buy it, 
 Then I set that shit on fire. 
 Blow smoke to the o-zone, 
 Trying to learn it as I go. 
 Staring at the blue print, 
 I ask her nasty things, 
 She tells me that she's so into it. 
 She said I changed, 
 Then she asked me what's the difference. 
 I say Trini James, 
 This nigga' is a bad influence 
 Trinidad James 
 Hold the hand claps 'cause I don't want none, 
 My iPhone's got a gold button (Flexin'), 
 Lime-green to match my money, 
 I'm on one, so pray for me. 
 Nigga yo' bitch, she cum for me, 
 She in good hands, nigga' don't worry, 
 What we do is none of your concern. 
 With yo' pussy you in turn, 
 So with yo' pussy it's my turn, 
 I'm arrogant when I want some, 
 I hate a bitch who want no nut, 
 Fuck her so good think she owes something, 
 She says she want a cut, 
 So I said "Let's get faded," 
 She thought I was a joke, 
 But nah baby, I ain't Ledger, 
 So she slipped off her Cements, 
 And started sippin semen, 
 She ain't even breathin' just...(moaning), 
 She goin' in, 
 So the next time you on the couch, 
 Chillin' lookin' at Netflix, 
 Know that I was in yo' house, 
 Givin' yo' bitch the business.
