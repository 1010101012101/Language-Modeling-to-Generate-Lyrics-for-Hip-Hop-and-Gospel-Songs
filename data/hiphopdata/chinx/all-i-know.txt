Yeah 
 Right 
 It's all I know 
 Talking 'bout the money, talking 'bout the money 
 Talking 'bout the hoes, talking 'bout the hoes 
 Talking 'bout the cars 
 That street shit is all I know, it's all I know 
 It's all I know, it's all I know, it's all I know, it's all I know 
 Nigga if you scared go and buy yourself a gun or call 5-0 
 It's all I know, it's all I know, it's all I know, it's all I know 
 Nigga if you scared go and buy yourself a gun or call 5-0 
 Drew the perfect portrait now I'm hanging up the picture 
 Bought myself a fortress isolated from them niggas 
 Drinking out the faucet that's equated with the riches 
 Curve ya niggas but do anything for the bitches 
 Came from the bottom sewer 
 Ballin like Dumars back when he played for the piston 
 Hit the gun range practice aiming at a witness 
 Song singing need 'em at arraignment with the biscuit 
 Coke Boy ex-dope boy 
 If you ya brothers keeper nigga watch him die doughboy 
 Boys in the hood still drinking juice 
 Thots in the hood still getting loose 
 Talking 'bout the money, talking 'bout the money 
 Talking 'bout the hoes, talking 'bout the hoes 
 Talking 'bout the cars 
 That street shit is all I know, it's all I know 
 It's all I know, it's all I know, it's all I know, it's all I know 
 Nigga if you scared go and buy yourself a gun or call 5-0 
 It's all I know, it's all I know, it's all I know, it's all I know 
 Nigga if you scared go and buy yourself a gun or call 5-0 
 Everything that happened in these streets god planned em 
 You know I'm close 'cause you can feel the heat start fanning 
 Snatch the soul out your punk ass make you touch grass 
 Put a hole in 'em big enough you can park a van in 
 Came up swapped the sardines for the salmon 
 See it's funny how real brick layers turn to scammers 
 Still watching cameras trafficking the balance 
 Air your dirty laundry keep your eyes on your hammer 
 Talking 'bout the money, talking 'bout the money 
 Talking 'bout the hoes, talking 'bout the hoes 
 Talking 'bout the cars 
 That street shit is all I know, it's all I know 
 It's all I know, it's all I know, it's all I know, it's all I know 
 Nigga if you scared go and buy yourself a gun or call 5-0 
 It's all I know, it's all I know, it's all I know, it's all I know 
 Nigga if you scared go and buy yourself a gun or call 5-0
