I would've been here sooner 
 I would've been here sooner 
 But I was caught up in the hoes 
 Caught up in the cars 
 Caught up in the money 
 Caught up in the life 
 I would've been here sooner 
 (But I got caught up in the dope game) 
 Talking bout this money made me feel 
 (I got caught up in the dope game) 
 A certain type of way, certain type of way 
 (I got caught up in the dope game) 
 Sorry for the wait 
 (I got caught up in the dope game) 
 Sorry for the wait 
 (I got caught up in the dope game) 
 Better late than never, perfect timing for the money 
 Watchin' niggas ball I swear to god it made me hungry 
 Blowin' California just a product of the corner 
 Talkin' out of turn I had them niggas run up on you 
 Whip to chill a nigga broke his wrist and bought a foreign 
 Niggas kill you for this lifestyle if they can't afford it 
 Bank 12 stories 
 Drop top shawty 
 Cock Glock 40' 
 Hit the court and drop 40 
 It's hot up in the kitchen turn the fan up 
 Quick to sit and when you piss, a nigga stand up 
 Nigga quit the bitchin', nigga stand up 
 Retaliations when them niggas hit your man up 
 Young niggas aiming at your head for them dollars 
 Nigga talk trash, find his head in the garbage 
 We ain't gotta kill him, he was head on arrival 
 Nigga paranoid, man I swear I'm getting followed 
 I would've been here sooner 
 I would've been here sooner 
 But I was caught up in the hoes 
 Caught up in the cars 
 Caught up in the money 
 Caught up in the life 
 I would've been here sooner 
 (But I got caught up in the dope game) 
 Talking bout this money made me feel 
 (I got caught up in the dope game) 
 A certain type of way, certain type of way 
 (I got caught up in the dope game) 
 Sorry for the wait 
 (I got caught up in the dope game) 
 Sorry for the wait

 Been in corners ridin' on them niggas no insurance 
 Feds rest the kitchen, throw the chickens down the toilet 
 Fuck them niggas talkin', straight to business I was on it 
 Dope flow feeds, tell your Christmas every morning 
 Nigga back when I got pitched I played the bail out 
 Now I sit on red guts, push it to the red line 
 Straight to bucket on them niggas talkin' cleared out 
 Hatin' holidays because the pens and your mail out 
 It's hot up in the kitchen turn the fan off 
 Light flash when them niggas pull the van up 
 Told my niggas go and get it fuck the scan up 
 For you be a man down, keep your head up 
 All you niggas told me use a green light 
 'Member nigga used to move to workin' for the clean light 
 Nigga drop his top they be aimin at your bean light 
 Youngin was a church nigga, now he throwing B's like 
 I would've been here sooner 
 I would've been here sooner 
 But I was caught up in the hoes 
 Caught up in the cars 
 Caught up in the money 
 Caught up in the life 
 I would've been here sooner 
 (But I got caught up in the dope game) 
 Talking bout this money made me feel
