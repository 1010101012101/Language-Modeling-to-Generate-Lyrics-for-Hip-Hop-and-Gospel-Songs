Lil Durk 
 I ain't gon' lie 
 (I ain't gon' lie) 
 I ain't gon' lie 
 (I ain't gon' lie) 
 I ain't gon' lie 
 (I ain't gon' lie) 
 I ain't gon' lie 
 I ain't gon' lie, got K's in the crib that'll shoot 
 40 cal, 50 cal, one call my niggas gone hit you up 
 I ain't gon' lie, got bricks in the crib for the low 
 One call my niggas gotta get that move 
 I ain't gon' lie 
 Chinx 
 (I ain't gon' lie) 
 We move that work right from off of the playground 
 (I ain't gon' lie) 
 These niggas quiet, the shit I be smoking it stay loud 
 (I ain't gon' lie) 
 Them youngins I came with don't play around 
 (I ain't gon' lie) 
 They hit your chest and yo head with that K round 
 (I ain't gon' lie) 
 Letting off a hundred round drum, cook a pussy nigga well done 
 Stick the fork in 'em, my young niggas hit 'em for the low 
 Real niggas sitting in the feds 
 Down to go to war for the spread 
 Hope you got a helmet, hit a fuck nigga in the head 
 Extended clip, hey 
 Need an extra liver 'cause I'm 'bout mine 
 Nigga you food, and every nigga with me know it's chow time 
 Hold it steady ay, niggas keep your eyes on the target 
 Ain't nobody gonna miss 'em, just one less pussy nigga on the market 
 (I ain't gon' lie) 
 We move that work right from off of the playground 
 (I ain't gon' lie) 
 These niggas quiet, the shit I be smoking it stay loud 
 (I ain't gon' lie) 
 Them youngins I came with don't play around 
 (I ain't gon' lie) 
 They hit your chest and yo head with that K round 
 (I ain't gon' lie) 
 Lil Durk 
 I ain't gone lie to a nigga 
 Talkin' all this roof, Imma ladder me a nigga 
 Tell 'em climb up, Rolex on me say time's up 
 50 seconds from the west niggas get ground up 
 Ain't gone lie to a nigga dad 
 Or another nigga he don't give a damn of 
 I keep the nine tucked, if you come around wrinkle my shit 
 You gon have some, then we been work 
 Stay on the porch and finish school first 
 Proof in the line to me, nigga you gone need a hearse 
 OTF, 300, Coke Boy I know you niggas heard of Lil Durk 
 No CNN or TMZ, Chiraq where you heard it first
