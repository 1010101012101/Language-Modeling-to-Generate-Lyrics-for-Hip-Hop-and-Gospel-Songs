I love it when you push it back 
 When I'm making love to you 
 And baby when you bite your lip 
 I Wanna go deeper, deeper, deeper 
 Keep on pushing back (Keep on pushing back) 
 Just keep on pushin back (just keep on pushing back) 
 And I'll deeper for you babe 
 Can I go deeper bay bay 
 (x2) 
 Girl I love the way you read my mind 
 The way you always know when I wanna grind 
 Girl you know I always Satisfy on the first time 
 Second and third time 
 Girl your sweating just as hard and me 
 Pumping as hard as me 
 Want it as bad as me 
 I'll make sure that you get yours before I get mine 
 I'm in the mood tonight 
 Can I play it like a Submarine 
 Or take it all the way down to the bottom 
 I wanna see you shaking at the knees 
 Hiding you face under the pillow 
 Girl I see you ain't holding back and I ain't holding back 
 Who needs tomorrow 
 Cause tonight your getting all of me 
 Make your body follow me like it's apart of me
