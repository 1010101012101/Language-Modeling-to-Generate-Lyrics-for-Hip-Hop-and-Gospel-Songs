Baby girl (Baby girl) 
 I don't know how to tell you this 
 But, I feel a little outta line 
 I don't know if it's the right thing 
 I mean, I don't know if it's inapropriate... 
 I've got a secret 
 That I've been holdin' from you 
 Don't know what I should do 
 Girl I want you everyday 
 Because we've worked together 
 Can we mix business with pleasure 
 Boy I've beem thinkin' that 
 I think it's bout time you know that 
 I've been wantin you for a long long time 
 And I've been lovin' you for a long long time 
 Can you second my emotion 
 I've been lovin' you for a long long time 
 And I've been wantin you for a long long time 
 Words can't explain 
 How I feel about you 
 Contemplating and waiting to see if I could steal your heart 
 I don't know how you would feel 
 But I've been keepin' it to myself 
 I ain't tell no one else, but you 
 Girl I ca-ant 
 I can't stop thinkin' about you 
 I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I can't stop lookin' at you 
 I-I can't 
 I can't stop dreamin' about you 
 I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I can't stop talkin' about you 
 (Baby) 
 (CHORUS: until end of song)
