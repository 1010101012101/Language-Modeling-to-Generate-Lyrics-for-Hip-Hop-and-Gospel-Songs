Cops ain't shit to me 
 Jobs ain't nothing but free pens and long distance calls 
 Thought I had it all, the God got birth control 
 I've never paid parking ticket: 
 It's 20 dollars now or 300 then; 
 You want your money, come and get it 
 But better bring 200 guns and a 100 men 
 I've killed a million pens and thrown many stones, but never lost a bet 
 Looking at the fossil on my wrist like 
 "Is my five minutes up yet?" 
 Got more time to relax now; 
 So I can say, "Fuck the industry." 
 Went for Rupert Murdoch's throat and left with Rawkus trying to sign me 
 You can't buy me 
 I'm holding my chips till I land on last base 
 I didn't burn any bridges; 
 I never needed none of 'em in the first place 
 'Cause money made is money gone is money never had 
 Money here only pretends to care for the people we leave around 
 Always pack light 'cause the guns are packing suckers 
 All mad 'cause someone else paid' em 
 Shaking in their waste-your-life-away stance 
 'Cause it's cool to be tragically hip: 
 Fools rule the Universe - it's O.K. 
 You say you want blood but drink piss all day 
 I say hang the queen from every streetlight on every Washington Street 
 Tell 'em it's difficult to have sex on waterbeds 
 'Cause most of us can't afford waterbeds 
 And if we could, we'd move out the hipster settlement of Oakland 
 (The fine line between low icome and no income) 
 I can't read no lips 'cause I am stone 
 Always wanted to be a rapper 
 But when I finally made it there, no one wanted me 
 Since no one wants me here 
 In the immortal words of Ice-T: 
 "You should have killed me last year." 
 Bit in the mere mortal words of me 
 I've torn up some rebuttals and lost some friends 
 But like the old saying goes 
 "If you can't nuke 'em... starve 'em or drop food on 'em." 
 I'm half a brothel, half a novel, half a one-man army 
 MC's don't want beef, they wnna shake my hand 
 Then make a diss song about me 
 Idiots live to outdo their shortcoming 
 While my inner Napoleon is frying the biggest fish 
 I hold the gridge like a mic and a girl like a cross 
 People say I'm vague 
 But we know who's in vogue and when the revolution comes 
 All you'll know how to do is beg 
 The white man... is the fucking Devil 
 The white man is the baddest poet
