I hope you like my stupid painting 
 It won't be here next time, you'll burn it 
 I'm no matisse and never said I could paint 
 The way things are going... I dunno if I'm gonna finish it 
 I graduated with passin' colors 
 Into the world and directly through the other side 
 Fitting in isn't about what you know 
 It's what you don't know that makes you a team player 
 So many ways to freeze but never taught us one...
