You know what 
 I'd like to send my condonlences out 
 To the whole Jackson family 
 Be so real 
 I feel Mike was one of my family members man 
 He was one of the closet things to home 
 Without actually being at home 
 And I only need to say that we love you Mike 
 Put your lighters in the air 
 If you love him 
 Yeah, everybody put your lighters in the air 
 If you love him 
 Yeah, the tribute 
 To the greatest that ever did it 
 Okay, pay homage to the kid 
 You gone too soon dawg 
 No more smooth talk 
 No more white glove 
 No more moonwalk 
 Showed me how to look at the man in the mirror 
 I see how the heal the world you couldn't paint a better picture 
 Michael we miss you 
 What we do without you 
 I'mma keep you in my heart no matter what they say about you 
 How can I explain this 
 There never been a man better 
 When it comes to entertaining 
 So haters take a beating and leave alone 
 Damn you shined, I remember the time (I remember Mike) 
 And Billie Jean was not my lover 
 It made sense for the public, Mike we love ya 
 Mike we love ya, Mike we miss ya 
 There could never be another entertainer 
 Mike we love ya, Mike we miss ya 
 I swear that heaven sent down an angel 
 When He sent you, When He sent you, When He sent you 
 Put your lighters up, put your lighters up 
 Remember the times 
 Tell me was it Dirty Diana 
 Or Billie Jean that had me wildin' for the camera 
 Or people screamin' for the video with Janet 
 Or them concert tickets that we can't afford 
 We miss you dawg that's real 
 I feel like one of my brothers got killed 
 Saw you moonwalk first time got chills 
 Thought it was a dream what you lived through killed 
 Despite him and Trey Songz beefin' 
 They need to get ready for the double up remix 
 Why beat gangs, MJ chain 
 On the way baby I can drop 20ks 
 Make 'em say young when I put them gloves on 
 Everytime is a Thriller, got them number ones for em 
 We miss you dawg and that's real 
 Now off to Neverland with the triple stack wheels 
 Mike we love ya, Mike we miss ya 
 There could never be another entertainer 
 Mike we love ya, Mike we miss ya 
 I swear that heaven sent down an angel 
 When He sent you, When he sent you, When he sent you 
 Hey this goes out 
 Public Service Announcement 
 My brother ain't here with me 
 But if he was, he would tell you motherfuckers 
 Let's Go 
 Michael Jackson 
 The Greatest of all Time 
 We bow in the prescence of greatness 
 We Love Ya 
 And our lighters still up for you 
 We love ya 
 And you we do is for you 
 Let's Go 
 Michael Jackson: 
 Why, Why 
 Why, Why
