 Girl I wish I can paint a perfect picture 
 Put it in a frame 
 Throw a ring on ya finger and give you my last name 
 Pick a champagne pink tran vicky 
 To a sister to my big brother bro Saint Richy 
 Baby want business 
 We can get busy 
 Make love with the camera on you can watch with me 
 'Cause ma its swag it outrageous 
 Button up my Louie Vuitton blazer 
 And girl I never said that I was perfect 
 But they wanna rock shit that I purchase 
 I'm something like a star 
 There you are 
 Nobody got a swag like moi 
 Tried to play around with ya boy still confronting (still in love)
