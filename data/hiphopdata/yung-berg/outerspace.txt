Say hey baby (hey baby) 
 Yo baby (yo baby) 
 I've been tryin' to keep my eyes off you but everybody knows I'm feeling you 
 Yeah baby (yeah baby) 
 Yo baby (yo baby) 
 From the way that you walk, the way you move 
 Damn ya cute, tubes, designer shoes 
 (Girl you a star from) Head to toe 
 (Thought I'd be the first to) Let you know 
 Forget about traveling aross the globe 
 (I will take you, I will take you) 
 (Cum and swear) Girl right away 
 (You gon' be up) Night to day 
 Took her to the shop, people stormin' out (Ay) 
 (So what you sayin') 
 We about to seek off so slip off your shoes and 
 (Put your Louis luggage in of a red Benz) 
 You gon' feel it when we take off, feel it when we movin' 
 Feel it when we touch, girl you know what we doin' 
 I'm gonna take you outerspace 
 I'm gonna take you outerspace 
 I'm gonna take you outerspaa-aaace

 I'm gonna take you outerspaa-aaace 
 So hey baby (hey baby) 
 Yo baby (yo baby) 
 Girl the way you puttin' it down on me feels like we're in a new galaxy 
 Yeah baby (yeah baby) 
 Yo baby (yo baby)

 So baby won't you come to me 
 (Start off fast) Then take it slow 
 (Right there girl) And there it goo-ooh 
 Girl, babay

 Took her to the shop, people stormin' out (Ay)

 So I ain't satisfied till I'm up inside of you 
 I wanna see your bed break 
 Baby girl I wanna see your legs shake 
 When I'm inside of you
