I ain't tryna be ya boyfriend, lemme manage ya 
 (Verse 1 - Yung Berg) 
 Yeah, these girls like me 'cause I show 'em somethin' icy 
 Roll Somethin' nicely 
 Make her wanna have a seed, Hope her son looks like me 
 Uh, can't imagine the things that I'm fightin 
 Collipark on the drums, I know you gon like it 
 Chi-Town swag wit a A-Town bounce 
 Mix in all in together Watch a hit drop out 
 See we started from the kitchen, from the bed, 
 To the couch 
 Gave her 45 minutes I was In 
 Then I'm Out 
 See my mama say I'm lucky 
 The hood say they love me 
 These girls (hate the part how i?) Put no one above me 
 See now I'm livin' lovely 
 My Girl Gotta buddy 
 But she be trippin' out because her girls wanna fuck me 
 And now we pullin up, see 
 Me and the boy Lloyd 
 Redbone (Girls) 
 Lambourghini (Toys) 
 Take it to tha flo, 'Cause I know how to handle ya 
 I ont wanna be ya man I wanna be ya manager 
 (Chorus - Lloyd) 
 Know I'm hot, let the top down if you burnin up 
 Speakers Knockin' the block down wen we pullin up 
 I see you movin around on the dance floor 
 Baby watcha doin' here watcha mad for
