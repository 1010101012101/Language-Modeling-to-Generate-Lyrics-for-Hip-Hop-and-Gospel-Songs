Yo, it goes tellin', hoes bobbin' 
 Saturday 3'o clock on Melrose shoppin' 
 6pm flight for more club hoppin' 
 Landing at H town, damn, they got it poppin' 
 The whole party rockin' if the young don't know how we come through 
 One night in town and we only got one room 
 Presidential suite, baby, girl with the front view 
 Forget about your friends, ma, I'm talkin' to you 
 Said the way you move, girl, you puttin' it down 
 Got me stuck in the zone, I can't leave her alone, I gotta have her around 
 See I don't know about you, girl, you turnin' me on, turnin' me on 
 Gotta nigga, like hold up, wait a minute, stop 
 (It's all on you) 
 Would you be my lover? 
 (For one night) 
 I just wanna hold you 
 (For one night) 
 I don't wanna tease you 
 Promise, I'm a please you 
 If you let me hold you 
 (For one night) 
 Would you be my lover? 
 (For one night) 
 I just wanna hold you 
 (For one night) 
 Gotta nigga, like hold up, wait a minute, stop 
 (It's all on you) 
 So what you want me to do? I'm doing all I possibly can 
 Ma, I been at the airport waitin' on stand by 
 All this just to catch a plane out to NY 
 And lay yo ass down for one night 
 You know what I live like, yeah, the mansion, the coupe 
 You should've known I could never settle down with you 
 Until I see you in Atlanta when I mail you through 
 I got twenty four hours for you 
 Said the way that you move, girl, you puttin' it down 
 Got me stuck in the zone, I can't leave her alone, I gotta have her around 
 See I don't know about you, girl, you turnin' me on 
 Gotta nigga, like hold up, wait a minute, stop 
 (It's all on you) 
 Would you be my lover? 
 (For one night) 
 I just wanna hold you 
 (For one night) 
 I don't wanna tease you 
 Promise, I'm a please you 
 If you let me hold you 
 (For one night) 
 Would you be my lover? 
 (For one night) 
 I just wanna hold you 
 (For one night) 
 Gotta nigga, like hold up, wait a minute, stop 
 (It's all on you)
