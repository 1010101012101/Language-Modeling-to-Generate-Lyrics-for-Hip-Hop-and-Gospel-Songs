 Ray j:ya took me swimmin, in the ocean and we flyin 
 Coast to coast and ya always keep me focused yeaheyeah

 Yb:ay I'm headed uptown to harlem to pick my mami up 
 I know da pussy tight, she ain't tryina give it up 
 She my pretty, young thing

 Body like jlo face like selina 
 Saturday morn' reggaton out the speakers,

 She knows that imma playa but when I get a chance 
 Imma put her ina bed, shit, n j holday her 
 I'm all about paper, but ma it ain't a party if i 
 Can't have you

 For the weekend, by da weekend, puerto rican yeaheyeah 
 Yb:I'm headed downtown, chicago to pick ma shawty up

 Roll up, hit the pip till she cough her lungs up 
 But baby she a freak, she taught me da tummy tuck 
 Girl:what is that? 
 Yb:its when I lay a pillow down, on her stomach flat 
 Hand full of hair, just the arch of her back, 
 Then I go deep in it, so deep in it that I fall 
 Asleep in it 
 Ay, betta hope that shit don't leak in it, shell 
 Try tuh keep it in less than 3 minutes 
 And baby, she a pimp, she dealin' wit three niggas 
 But I still love her, we do it like no other 
 Ray j:ya took me swimmin, in the ocean and we flyin 
 Coast to coast and ya always keep me focused yeaheyeah 
 On a island, jet skiin', me and you girl 
 For the weekend, by da weekend, puerto rican yeaheyeah 
 I make a stop in Spanish harlem, pick ma girl up 
 I bought a red rose it matched my red tux 
 Take her to a island, make her feel special 
 Hop up on a jet, take ya to a place ya ain't never 
 Been yet 
 Fiji is the island, that's where we'll get wet 
 Had me swimmin in the ocean, flyin coast to coast 
 Always keep me focused 
 Yeaheyeah
