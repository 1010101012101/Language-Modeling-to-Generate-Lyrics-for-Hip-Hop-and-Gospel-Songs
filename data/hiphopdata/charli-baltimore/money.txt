For the love of what... 
 Uh huh, Untertainment 
 Charli's Angels 
 H-Class, little it 
 Uh uh 
 Verse One: Charli Baltimore 
 I don't know if it's the pretty face or the expensive taste 
 That got everybody wantin' to touch me like Case 
 Feels So Good like Mase, to pull over 
 Anywhere I want, diplomats on the Rover 
 The way I put it on a nigga sober 
 I have 'em comin' back, knockin' on my door like Johovas 
 Y'all already know that Charli's in charge 
 Weekly massage, platinum and gold cars 
 Money stashed from NY to Witchitaw 
 And I stay with my niggas cause you know how bitches are 
 Aggy, 'cause they baby daddy wanna bag me 
 That's why I never leave home without the chrome maggy 
 Y'all hoes can't do nothin' to me 
 I got this game wrapped like a dubee 
 Pinned up in what? 
 Charli rappin' about, I really got 
 And it ain't that I'm stuck on myself, I'm really hot 
 Uh 
 For the love of money (dollar bills y'all) 
 For the love of money (gots to have it, eh-heh) 
 For the love of money (dollar bills y'all) 
 For the love of money (really need it, yeah) 
 Verse Two: Charli Baltimore 
 Yo yo, femminine honey 
 Rich niggas be swimmin' in money 
 I need Jet Ski's in mind, can't tease a dime 
 Lookin' in the mirror, feeling pleased with the shine 
 Lady Rolex for the time, the class is "S" 
 Wear the ice on the bra of my chest 
 When the money ain't right I go far to the left 
 Niggas wanna play games then Charli the ref 
 Wanna Long Kiss Goodnight, don't hold ya breath 
 Niggas know I'm the shit with my MAC lipstick 
 Crushin' the player haters with a purple navigator 
 Shoes alligator, my bag is too 
 If I was broke like you, I would be mad like you 
 But you can come work for Charli, a boss with a body 
 Ask anybody, I could take over Gotti 
 Cool by the pool while you diss another hottie 
 Pissy broke bitch that'll stay actin' snotty 
 For the love of money (dollar bills y'all) 
 For the love of money (gots to have it, eh-heh) 
 For the love of money (dollar bills y'all) 
 For the love of money (really need it, yeah) 
 Verse Three: Charli Baltimore 
 Uh huh, yo when you look you see the slim waist leavin' no trace 
 Cause nigga's who know Charli will be in the breifcase 
 Yeah Long Kiss Goodnight, Baltimore get it right 
 For the cash, hop out the window and shoot through the ice 
 Ain't no love here, just the black gloves here 
 Check it, and I don't get involved with nothing I can't leave in 30 seconds 
 But my kids, they think mommy a teacher 
 They don't know, for the love of this 
 I make the whole world tre' blow 
 Then go, get 'em ready for school like nothing happen 
 Here's a apple for the teacher, tell 'em mommy said "Hi" 
 Bet he won't fail you no more, one more "F" and he die 
 Even with my nails done, I can take guns apart son 
 So when they come lookin' for this reporter broke Un 
 Dealt with birds, but I had to move on 
 But for memories I tattooed the little Peacock on my arm 
 Ask Un how the ones be when he advance me dough 
 So I put out mines and tell dawg keep yours yo 
 For real... 
 For the love of money (dollar bills y'all) 
 For the love of money (gots to have it, eh-heh) 
 For the love of money (dollar bills y'all) 
 For the love of money (really need it, yeah) 
 For the love of money (dollar bills y'all) 
 For the love of money (gots to have it, eh-heh) 
 For the love of money (dollar bills y'all) 
 For the love of money (really need it, yeah)
