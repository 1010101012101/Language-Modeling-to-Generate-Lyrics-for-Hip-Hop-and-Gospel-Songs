GAME; stop snitchin', stop lyin' DOT com 
 The blair snitch project DOT com 
 CHARLI; slow motion 
 Hoes go on hiatus when I come through 
 Baltimore 
 High 8ish, plus I'm hard too 
 Dime bitch 
 Call who 
 21 plus lookin' 19 in tight jeans 
 Nigga to bust 
 Nigga fuck game 
 Better be me 
 Front and back 
 Left pocket so swoll 'cause ya' ass to lean 
 Put a match to me 
 Gasoline 
 Game, I spits that 
 Any bitch nigga 
 Track what 
 I rips that 
 And I can flip back 
 To that night at the kit kat 
 When un and jay had they little tif af 
 Forget that 
 Sorry short 'un' lance 
 I'm just tryna advance 
 Fall back 
 Real niggas keep a gun in they hands 
 Real niggas keep it real 
 Big dicks in they pants 
 You might be feelin' like a bitch 
 Violatin' you 
 And? 
 Brush your shoulders 
 Dust shit off 
 Till I gets off 
 Ain't over till the dick's soft 
 Nah 
 Stops when I kicks off 
 Be redbulls 
 E pills 
 Never refills 
 Dead sober 
 Red rover 
 Head over 
 Ain't in the business of askin' 
 I'm expectin' 
 And that hot shit y'all rappin' about 
 Bitch I slept in it 
 Dior had the toastas 
 BIG was wreckin' it 
 Ain't gotta put our shit on blast 
 Cats acceptin' it 
 Anything I state my name on I'm the best in it 
 Fuck what 
 Want it with chuck 
 I'm addressin' it 
 GAME; can't keep a good bitch down 
 Philly stand up 
 CHARLI; nigga slide over 
 My wide body never plays shotgun in that wide body white rover 
 Beef, I'm right over 
 They slip, I never hesitate 
 Exorcist head 
 Make 'em spin 
 Dick's levitate 
 Bitch I don't separate thoroughbreds from featherweights 
 They can get duct taped and trunked if my chedda late 
 My bread at stake so I ride to the death 
 Blackwallstreet danglin' in between my breast 
 Oh yes 
 From the home of the ruthless 
 Philly know 
 Where my corner boys throw more bricks than yayo 
 You know 
 I ain't talkin' that wack shit he spit 
 I'm talkin' pack shit niggas re-uped and flipped 
 So we can skip the motherfuckin' commentary 
 I put a couple on irv gotti commissary 
 Let's see 
 Robbed my budget for like 1.3 
 Then got ghost when the feds was on the hunt for me 
 You just dissed us when bust got locked up on christmas 
 Me and the kids sittin' 
 You tryna put your dick in 
 Bitch I don't fuck with kitten 
 That mean pussy 
 And I ain't tryna kick you when you down 
 But you pushed me 
 Roll hard 
 Remember down ass chick 
 You let the whole M.I. fall apart for a snitch 
 You let my whole project fall apart for a bitch 
 But I bounce back quick like quarter ounce to bricks
