3rd verse 
 Hold up 
 Now niggaz tellin' in the movies? 
 What's the name of part two? 
 Get rich or die snitchin? 
 Stay away 
 Order in the... 
 What's ya name? 
 Stop bitchin! 
 Call the reporter 
 She got tape recorder 
 Got chea 
 "He laced some thing" 
 In the booth 
 Tellin' truth 
 With ya right hand high 
 Left shakin 
 Dawg stop fakin 
 You'z a window shopper 
 One sign to that one way glass to cops 
 How many leg pops did it take to break you? 
 I know a wild nigga in jail who'd love to break you 
 Said he liked you all greased up, muscles ripped 
 'Cause the bigga you iz, the smaller ya dick 
 And the smaller the dick 
 It remind him of the pussy 
 U got the right nigga when you go through g.p. 
 C.p. hood rat 
 Born and bread 
 So I ain't mine man enough for anything I said 
 M.i. let it slide 
 I tried to ryde it 
 But I got shut down 
 Bitch whaddup now? 
 I don't run with beef you can bring it 
 I know ya snitch ass song you can sing it 
 He did it she did it they did it 
 And what? 
 Sign ya statement 
 Ya 15 minutes is up 
 U fucked you fucked you fucked
