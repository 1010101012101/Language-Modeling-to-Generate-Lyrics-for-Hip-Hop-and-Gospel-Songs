Artist: charli baltimore f/ mase 
 Uh nigga 
 Uhm, yeah 
 (Do you wanna (repeat through song)) 
 [Charli baltimore] (mase) 
 Yo, yo, yo 
 See I hold my head, hoes wanna 'spite me 
 Mad, I got the jag' but they the wifey 
 Icey, is what my merchandise be 
 Know I'ma star, so they over-price me 
 Charli b'more be twice you bitch 
 Tell you got no style by the ice you pick 
 Step into my cold area, polar bear wear 
 White minking, white lincoln, now what you thinking 
 What? too much ice got you blinking? 
 Meanwhile, mickey sinking, what you drinking 
 West philly, bad bitch, dress really 
 Ain't met a nigga with enough dough to sex really 
 Seen everything, from king's to heavy haters 
 Cherry gators, tahoe in every flavor 
 Rhymes I wrote (9's I tote 'em) 
 And times I hold 'em 
 I even put 9's in niggas quotas 
 What 
 Yeah 
 What 
 Yeah 
 What what 
 Yeah what what 
 Turn me up, though 
 Turn me up 
 (Mase) 
 Yo, yo, now if you don't stop 
 Then we won't stop 
 If you want the bottom, then I'll be on top 
 I ain't never met a bitch that ain't ever suck a cock 
 So if you gotta proof, I gotta have a drop, bi-atch! 
 (Charli) 
 If you know b'more, then you know this song 
 I'ma rip any shit, niggas throw me on 
 While I'm reachin' mine, I ain't known you that long 
 Fuck around, nigga, wiggle more then your rollie gone 
 Ring too 
 Get that nigga cream too 
 Hit him bout once or twice, dream come true 
 (Mase) 
 I'll give you more then a six, mansion on the beach 
 Chanel flip flop's, satin all on ya feet 
 Liguini for brunch, or spice and your heat 
 So a bitch like you, can't check me from the street 
 (Charli) 
 I'm not a girl who'll dream about living with mase 
 All I wanna do is get his cake, and sit on his face 
 What what what 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 (Mase) 
 Yeah, what what what, what the fuck, ughh, yo 
 What they think, cause be mase young, mase be dumb 
 They get mase strung, there'll be no prenum 
 But ever since blood die, my life change 
 Out the blue, I'm they boo, that's quite strange 
 Now ya nice thangs, way out the price range 
 Half these girls, don't even know my right name 
 Though I got rollie, mink made of coyote 
 Love a ghetto hoe, I know she die for me 
 You got me confused, see cam the freak 
 Mase never the cat, bring sand to the beach 
 Show some that the average show-hand couldn't reach 
 Living expenses, 50 grand a week 
 You know me, I v-o-t, low key 
 Platinum rollie, smoke a o-z 
 Baby face nigga, without no goatee 
 2 point 8, about to blow 3 
 Huh 
 What the fuck 
 What the fuck 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 What what what 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 What what what 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 What what what 
 Uh 
 What the fuck 
 Don't stop 
 What the fuck 
 We won't stop 
 Harlem-philly's 
 Still bless ya forever 
 Mase blessed forever
