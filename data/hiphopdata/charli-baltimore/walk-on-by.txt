 Verse 1-fat joe 
 This ain't for the intelligent civilized divas 
 For all the hoes and bitches who swallow nut by the leiters 
 Two months pregnant madd dick pokin' the fetus 
 But she don't give a damn still suckin' dick for sneakers 
 You know the type, damn dirty is right she even did it wit dice 
 And made a dildo of ice 
 A-yo it's like the hiest 
 Move ya phat ass to gain 
 And if you love me baby girl give my friends some entertainment (yo that's 
 Foul joe) 
 Hey yo I treat 'em how they act yo 
 Behave like a hooker and played like a madd hoe 
 Rumor has it that you take it in the asshole 
 And wrap ya lips around my dick like a lasso

 Joe crack bozak 
 While niggas bone that 
 My stomach's where ya nose at 
 Just another hoe in the midst 
 That does more than kiss when we start pourin' the 'cris

 Playin' niggas but they can't get shit from me 
 You ain't smokin' my lye 
 Pushin' my ride and if you ain't fuckin' just walk on by 
 All you bitches just walk on by 
 Verse 2-fat joe 
 I once knew a girl by the name of savannah 
 Met her backstage at a show in atlanta 
 Seemed like a nice girl, class and well-mannered 
 When I took her to the hotel the bitch went bananas 
 Did my eyes deceive me 
 Was she suckin' three pee-pee's 
 Caught it all on tape so I could watch it late on TV 
 Couldn't wait to beep me 
 Started in the car shorty caught the quick train from the trinity stars 
 Big joe'll railroad 
 Any frail hoe 
 Have a bitch scream and yell throwin' elbows 
 Now who the hell knows 
 Why these girls fuck for cell phones 
 Turnin' tricks for material shit 
 Now bust it, you wanna hit it gotta pay top dollar 
 These chics is hott rodders 
 Wit grips like rottwilers 
 But why bother 
 Picture me payin' a fee 
 I'll just play like akinyle and fuck these hoes for free 
 Verse 3-charli baltimore 
 Picture b-more on the floor on all fours 
 Mind must've lost yours 
 Never been tossed 
 Tour that's what I do for ones 
 Not whore baby that's what I do for fun 
 Now I dread that I gave you head 
 All because them four double a duracells went dead 
 My vibrator... huh! playa hatin' on me 
 Thinking you can hit this and get away scott free 
 Now you boomeranged... all I wanted was some ac-tion 
 Brought my own branton 
 Got my own mansion 
 Now you off tryin' to front to yo niggas 
 'Cause I blew ya back out and got my own figgas 
 Please, you was just something to do 
 Had a camcorder too 
 How you like that boo 
 You madd 'cause I hit that and vanished 
 Or 'cause you on tape screamin' "charli baltimore" in Spanish 
 All you bitches be fuckin' for money 
 Playin' niggas but they can't get shit from me 
 You ain't smokin' my lye 
 Pushin' my ride and if you ain't fuckin' just walk on by 
 All you bitches just walk on by

 Just walk on by
