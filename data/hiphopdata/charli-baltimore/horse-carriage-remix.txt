(Intro: silkk (cam'ron)) 
 Remix 
 (That's right) silkk the shocker 
 Uh, cam'ron (you ain't know) no limit 
 (That's right) untertainment 
 (I'm here and there) mo' money 
 (I'm here and there) 
 Ya don't know? 
 (Verse one: cam'ron) 
 Aye yo I just walk wit' y'all, I don't wanna rhyme 
 I just need talk wit' y'all 
 Mamasita, senortia 
 I'm lookin' for my wifey 
 Cats always love me, till they girls start to like me 
 They don't know I'm sheisty, and all my jewels icey 
 Tryin' to settle down ma, stop actin' all fiesty 
 Cause 'i don't wanna be a playa no more' 
 Know it's soft, but I cam with a 'core 
 For the love of money, charli, whoa it ain't my fault 
 Like silkk, it's so timid, my trunk, it go wit' it 
 The whole squad is terrorin', cats is no limit 
 And I'm a diplomat, I'm a dimplomat 
 Where my honeies at?, where my money at? 
 That's why we act like that 
 Clak clak clak!, pat pat pat! 
 So all you girls bring your thongs and shit 
 Don't front, cause you know what song this is 
 Ju don't know 
 (Chorus (wyclef)) 
 Ya don't know what we're going through 
 Ya don't know the things that cam is showing you 
 What we're about to do 
 You don't know 
 Ya don't know what we're going through 
 Ya don't know the things these thugs will do to you 
 You and your family through 
 Ya don't know 
 (Verse two: big punisher) 
 Yo, yo 
 All the mami's know me, the Spanish kid wit' the goat-ti 
 And fixes the land, I be a muthafuckin' o.g. 
 Ya my taste, thick in the waist, pretty in the face 
 Dominican race, like my twin triple says 
 Hot as hell, I'm trickin' in 
 Shorties sharp as nails, the official chick 
 Repin' uptown to harlem world, where we at 
 I'm up coughin' in the ambulance 
 From way downtown, they got the horses and the carriages 
 For 40 bucks, you can ride and get ya hug on 
 Another 20, puff lye and get ya crush on 
 It's all love, just like the bud' when ya hit it 
 Cause way downtown, you know the fuzz is tryin' to hear it 
 So when ya spark, ya make sure it's in the dark 
 And most importantly, stay away from central park 
 Cause cops live, just to put away a thug 
 But not today, cause me and my baby in the cabaret of love 
 (Chorus (wyclef)) 
 Ya don't know what we're going through 
 Ya don't know the things that cam is showing you 
 What we're about to do 
 You don't know 
 Ya don't know what we're going through 
 Ya don't know the things these thugs will do to you 
 You and your family through 
 Ya don't know 
 (Verse three: charli baltimore) 
 Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo, uh 
 I thought I already barked on cats about russ hadden 
 It ain't work, gotta scream on cats like wes craven 
 Owwwww!, they ain't know I hadn't in me 
 Like lil' kim --, didn't know they had it in me 
 Don't you know don't you know, we pull up from a show 
 Cam and chrome bag the hoes, I prada bags all the dough 
 And caked out, break out, uh 
 Horse and carriage, forced to marriage, been had too many carats 
 And they ain't know, passin' that down 
 Where I come from 
 Ask jane, that's my dun-dun 
 How we handle them dumb dumb's 
 And we like, siskel and elbert 
 We review cats, thumbs up if they they shit's right 
 And down if they new jack's 
 You might see charli, in a benz or ferrari 
 Hennesey or pacardi, gettin' bent at a party 
 But I flip, be the new face, cover of trace 
 This the muthafuckin' remix, we ain't need no mase 
 Uh huh uh huh 
 We like it (slikk the shocker) 
 Uh huh uh huh (cam'ron, no limit) 
 (Untertainment) 
 (Mo' money, ya heard me) 
 (Verse four: silkk) 
 I live life like a thug, cause time's is rough 
 Convicted felon 
 Now I'm like, rhyme for bucks 
 Ball till I fall, should I say, my time is up 
 And I cop you diamonds, never diamond cut 
 Forget the money, 'cause I could ball with or without the shipment 
 And I'm down girl, but I could ball with or without the chick 
 Sillk the shocker, cam'ron, now how you gonna doubt us a hit 
 (Must be a car), miss I could pull you, with or without the six 
 Now I ain't the c-e-o, but I ain't far from it 
 So if I ain't far from c-e-o 
 That mean I ain't far from havin' c-e-o money 
 Can't discuss what I'm worth, but I'm worth this much 
 Like mantigo, fall back like snatchin' purses for bust 
 So many styles 
 Drop a beat, I'ma drop a hit 
 Rap game stop for the dope game 
 And cop a brick 
 No limit soldier baby, so watch the talk 
 Get lost like, oh it ain't my fault! 
 I'm from the n-o, l-i, m-i to the t 
 Tru my click, silkk, the shocker, yeah that's me 
 Now look, money I'm tryin' to make it 
 Bustas I'm tryin' to break, girls is like 
 Ooh I love silkk, and then, ooh I hate him! 
 'Cause they can't have me, but I don't look 
 I can't afford to live average 
 So senorita, let me walk you to my carriage 
 Now I don't wanna settle down, but we can do it like we married 
 Cheese! 
 (Chorus (wyclef)) 
 Ya don't know what we're going through 
 Ya don't know the things that cam is showing you 
 What we're about to do 
 You don't know 
 Ya don't know what we're going through 
 Ya don't know the things these thugs will do to you 
 You and your family through 
 Ya don't know 
 Ya don't know what we're going through 
 Ya don't know the things that cam is showing you 
 What we're about to do 
 You don't know 
 Ya don't know what we're going through 
 Ya don't know the things these thugs will do to you 
 You and your family through 
 Ya don't know 
 (Music till fade)
