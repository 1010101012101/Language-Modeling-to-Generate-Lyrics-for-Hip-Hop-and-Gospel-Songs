 (Charli) 
 Say mobb deep, niggas go sorry 
 Niggas might rob me 
 See these niggas that go with car figures 
 Papers dial mine, clothes custom figure 
 Matchin' jon gotti to roll through customs nigga 
 Roll the custom built shit, I bust them clips 
 Niggas trust my lips, while they suck they dicks 
 Plus the kiss be the long goodnight 
 Murderous bitch be the wrong in spiked-typed 
 Price right, be that song, the right type 
 But only if havoc and p spittin' wit' me 
 And they say they gon' see that c.b. nice wit' it 
 Hinnesy and rimmy, and give me some ice wit' it 
 Shake down, niggas'll throw some dice in it 
 Put your money on chuck or in 9-9, you're fucked 
 Try your luck, stress this red-head 
 I mix blood in my dye, like my faily ties 
 Chorus (havoc and charli) 
 When you in the mix with this shit 
 Skin and bones, nothing but the fists 
 Do your hard beat, rapper lay a bid 
 Other dogs posted up over here 
 Niggas fuckin' up, where my niggas at huh? 
 Niggas be frontin', where my niggas at what? 
 Yo they don't want it 
 This is live nigga rap 
 Scared nigga, get back, but if not, it's cool 
 Cause right here is where it's at 
 (Havoc) 
 Yo, when I foul out on lab mouse 
 One nut and I'm out 
 Ain't tryin' to stick around, let a nigga catch me out of bound 
 Don't give a fuck about a rumor 
 Know how I get down 
 Let my man's do it, he gots to right to it 
 Known jay come through the door, still like they "who this? " 
 Don't got beef, but got niggas, serious ones 
 Make sure a nigga here, plus lasted wars 
 And stay countin' all that cash when I'm fuckin' wit' 'un' 
 Fuck around with my funds, got a bring a gun 
 Please don't make me have to puncture ya lungs 
 (Ty nitty) 
 'Cause we the ones rockin' 'em, the ones toppin' 'em 
 Gold bars unpredictable, like mystikal and shock and 'em 
 We heavenly like big, pac and them 
 Mobb deep and charli baltimore, who's coppin' 'em 
 Who's lockin' 'em, who's hotter then them 
 It's like a dice game and crack tito totterin' them 
 When you in the mix with this shit 
 Skin and bones, nothing but the fists 
 Do your hard beat, rapper lay a bid

 (Prodigy) 
 Yo, all and together we gon' rush the front door 
 Get at them 
 They dumpin' our songs, so now it's on 
 Infamous, my niggas pop clips to this 
 And fight to it 
 Niggas respect it, it's like we magnetic 
 It's like the last thing you want is drama 
 Go at the girls, have a good time, don't make it a problem 
 While we pop bottles of mo' 
 Burn down bottles of 'dro 
 Smack that ass of models and ho's 
 Rappin', all y'all some rag old bunnies 
 Ready to jump off 
 I'm on the side fondlin' this marcy 
 Black car be gone, q.b. bitches ready to brawl 
 Charli baltimore payin' dues, got it 'em balled 
 At the bar slashin' bitches 
 Over some niggas 
 From a wayne cell, we stuff back in '96 
 Spaid like... swallow the gin, we musclin' in 
 Play ya par kid, don't be a talkative marvin 
 When you in the mix with this shit 
 Skin and bones, nothing but the fists
