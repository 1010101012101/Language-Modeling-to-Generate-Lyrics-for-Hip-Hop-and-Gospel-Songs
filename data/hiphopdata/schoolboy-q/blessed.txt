What it's like for a nigga like me 
 Livin' out his backpack every night needed a new place to sleep 
 But this is now, nigga! 
 Ones for the money, two for the bitches 
 Three to get ready 'cause I feel I finally did it 
 Four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished 
 Turn that motherfucker to a critic 
 Man, I got so much shit up on my plate dawg 
 I was hangin' on them corners late 
 Pockets wasn't straight, bitch 
 I ain't gon' make it at this rate, dawg 
 Know what I'm sayin'? 
 Nigga prayin' up to God just hopin' that he hear a nigga 
 I know the world got more problems and it's much bigger 
 But I figured, I'd get some shit up off my chest 
 To all my niggas I would die for 
 Load my pistol up, go out and war for 
 To all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets 
 Fuck it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak 
 To all my niggas first time steppin' in the pen 
 Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in 
 To all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today 
 Take our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray 
 Just wanna say 
 Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga 
 Really think about it, could be worse my nigga 
 Don't stress my nigga, yes my nigga 
 We all blessed my nigga 
 Now how the fuck I'm 'posed to say this? 
 You see, my nigga just lost his son while I'm here huggin' on my daughter 
 I grip her harder 
 Kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit 
 Thinkin' of some bullshit to tell him, like 
 "It'll be okay. You'll be straight, it'll be aight." 
 Well, fuck that shit, whatever you need, yo, I got it! 
 Whether it's money or some weed or puttin' in work, fuck it, then I'm ridin'! 
 You know wassup, but now a nigga couldn't stick around 
 Told myself that after y'all moved that I'd be a fuckin' fool 
 To be livin' by the street rules 
 Fuck police tattoos, that happens when you ditch school 
 But anyway, keep the faith, stay strong brah 
 Remain' solid brah 
 Keep playin' ball 'cause it's the only way up out it, brah 
 A nigga proud of ya' 
 Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed, I'll have whatever he needs 
 We the last of a dyin' breed, live life, smoke trees 
 See how far we've come, but most, I'm sorry for your son 
 Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga 
 Really think about it, could be worse my nigga 
 Don't stress my nigga, yes my nigga 
 We all blessed my nigga 
 And you ain't gotta shed no tear 
 I'll be everywhere 
 And I'mma always be right here 
 I ain't forgot those years 
 I'll be everwhere 
 But I'mma always be right here 
 Livin' in a premature place - wait 
 Never grow to see the pearly gates - break 
 Every time a bullet detonate - dates 
 Of obituary carry crates of a scary picture 
 With a family member that relate to ya 
 In December you was finna pin another case 
 On your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe 
 As the record spinnin' you was hearin' angels entertain 
 Every pun intended, that was wicked, comin' from your brain 
 Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again 
 That's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain 
 Open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain 
 Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change 
 Everybody ain't (blessed my nigga) 
 Yes, my nigga, you're blessed 
 Take advantage, do your best, my nigga 
 Don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet 
 Anything you imagine, you possess, my nigga 
 You reject these niggas, that neglect, your respect 
 For the progress of a baby step, my nigga 
 Step, step my nigga 
 One, two, skip, skip 
 Back, back, look both ways 
 Pull it off the hip 
 Blast at anybody say that you can't flip 
 This crack into rap music every other zip is a track 
 Get used to it, get it off quick 
 Come back, give back to the city you've built 
 That's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas, dawg 
 It ain't nothin' but a bunch of fuck niggas dawg 
 In a minute everybody gon' be winnin' 
 Put a little faith in it then recognize that we all 
 Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga 
 Really think about it, could be worse my nigga 
 Don't stress my nigga, yes my nigga 
 We all blessed my nigga
