Figured that I gotta sell dope, or the money won't grow 
 Figured I was Too Short, and I could never turn pro 
 You could tell I never had shit, but bet I get that 80 grand wrist 
 Told me we could never get rich 
 Now watch me ride the chevy hit the switch 
 Straight ballin' like a bitch 
 Aye, riding through the city on chrome 
 Ghetto nigga out the sunroof, hey, four keys bitch please 
 Straight ballin' like a bitch 
 Flossin' in the mind, stuntin' like the first, shufflin' the work 
 Uh, I done came from the dirt 
 Now the engine make the tire go skrrt 
 Used to sleep with roaches cracky uncle and all 
 Now a hundred thousand just a hour involved 
 So easy how I make a mill' flip 
 Snoop ain't the only rich crip nigga 
 From sleepin' on Tops couch to multiple bank accounts 
 To havin' me a mall for house 
 They tried to slim my chances as kid though 
 They always said I'd never make it big though 
 Straight ballin' like a bitch 
 Picture me rollin' 
 Straight outta the ghetto to a deal that's a apartment in the sky 
 I used to smoke bush, now all this kush got me so high 
 Yeah, so high 
 I used to smoke bush, now all this kush got me so high 
 Straight ballin' like a bitch 
 Straight ballin' like a bitch 
 So high 
 Straight ballin' like a bitch 
 Straight ballin' like a bitch 
 Straight ballin' like a bitch 
 Aye, wait, waitin' on my turn to get paid 
 Nigga trying to make a mill a day 
 Put that rental on in the interstate 
 Since a youngin' I was gifted 
 Momma gave me some things for the bitches 
 Bruh I go through some things you gotta witness 
 Stomach get to mumblin' at night 
 Watchin' every car that drive by, lookin' every driver in the eye 
 52nd enterprise, marchin' in these chucks like they boots 
 Money make a pussy get the juice 
 Money make the copper give a pass 
 Money make me cop a bigger roof 
 Money got me skippin' every class 
 Tryna kill 'em for the summer 
 The teachers ain't teachin', the judge taught us numbers 
 We was raised by single mothers 
 Pop once took us undercover 
 So in the streets we learned colors 
 Hiding from the reaper tryna' dodge the cage 
 This shit I've done to rhyme on this stage 
 I went from king of the the corner 
 To breaking down weed on my diploma 
 Straight ballin' like a bitch 
 Picture me rollin' 
 Straight outta the ghetto to a deal that's a apartment in the sky 
 Straight ballin' like a bitch 
 Picture me rollin' 
 I used to smoke bush, now all this kush got me so high 
 Yeah, so high 
 I used to smoke bush, now all this kush got me so high 
 Straight ballin' like a bitch 
 Straight ballin' like a bitch 
 So high, So high, Yeah 
 Straight ballin' like a bitch 
 Straight ballin' like a bitch 
 Straight ballin' like a bitch
