Blow me down, I'll blow you down 
 Trade a body for a body 
 Nigga kamikaze 
 Tired of living no healthcare, I ain't fucking with wellfare 
 But its rap down, Hells near, Sherm on every corner like fountains near 
 G rock, mountaineer, chunk coats a cop would wear, double up, roca wear 
 Win or lose, none to spare, black jack safety pair 
 20 rounds one to the head, whole clip strike the beard 
 Breaking news fuck the feds, buckle up, simon says 
 Do the job nothing says, neighbors seen this shit for years 
 Hopped out, out of range, close up not a stain 
 Gut shot got him maimed, shit bag potty trained 
 No time for a nigga, got a strike up on my record 
 And I'm playing shit for what it's gonna be 
 A nigga sitting on his last hundred plus I owe the homie 50 
 And my bitch and she ridin' on E 
 Somebody gotta die, a body for a body, nigga, shit I'm feeling kamikaze 
 Somebody gotta die, a body for a body, nigga, shit I'm feeling kamikaze 
 Nigga welcome to Hell's kitchen, prayers missing 
 Doing good has no intentions, with the shit that I'm kicking 
 Heavens too far from forgiving 
 Stuck on a mission, Choppers by the windows 
 See the silhouettes, just like I'm heading fishing 
 Pay your rent or meet your soul's eviction, greet the reaper 
 Deliver death like serving pizza, dome piece the shell cracked like Sunday Easter 
 Feel this Ether, the pyromaniac, you niggas keisters 
 Ain't shit but ass, newest task is getting cash 
 Smoking hash and let it ash, off a dime like Steve Nash 
 22 by my lower calf, see a hawk, we sqeeze and blast 
 (Hahaha) Fucking laugh, shady more than aftermath 
 Eminem's my limit slim, we ain't the same no synonym 
 No synonym, get it in like lucifer, down and dirty emperor 
 With hell's demons and angels, rat-a-tat-tat-tat sent for ya 
 I major in your minisher, left his ass holy by the minister 
 Immortal Kombat finisher 
 No time for a nigga, got a strike up on my record 
 And I'm playing shit for what it's gonna be 
 A nigga sitting on his last hundred plus I owe the homie 50 
 And my bitch and she ridin' on E 
 Somebody gotta die, a body for a body, nigga, shit I'm feeling kamikaze 
 Somebody gotta die, a body for a body, nigga, shit I'm feeling kamikaze 
 Gangster, Gangster! Read all about it, a nigga got smoked 
 The killers name remains silent 
 Gangster, Gangster! Read all about it, there's guns in the streets 
 I know the governments supplying 
 Prison wars, race riot, ice pick in the neck, flatline 
 Another comic grave for man kind 
 Every step I take a land mine, blowin' up like 9-11, Hiroshima, Pearl Harbor 
 Afghan hobbies, got me feelin' Kamikaze (KABOOM) blow up the party 
 Sickest lad-i-dadi, peace on Earth you don't remind me 
 Dying Honor, Uni-bomber, you pre-madonna, I'm ghetto verson of Gia Connor 
 Mob bosses, count losses gain profits, same logic 
 Did it all but still stay silent, keep the gangster grooving in my blood 'cause 
 50's who I do it for, die for mine and ride on yours 
 No time for a nigga, got a strike up on my record 
 And I'm playing shit for what it's gonna be 
 A nigga sitting on his last hundred plus I owe the homie 50 
 And my bitch and she ridin' on E 
 Somebody gotta die, a body for a body, nigga, shit I'm feeling kamikaze 
 Somebody gotta die, a body for a body, nigga, shit I'm feeling kamikaze
