Know you're wrong, ooh 
 Hey, know you're wrong, ooh 
 These, all they wanna call you talkin' 'bout what they need 
 Know you're wrong, know you're wrong, oh 
 All I hear, "Gimme, gimme" 
 When y'all was sleepin', who was workin' with me 
 But want these benefits and tour the city 
 Leechin', won't you find your titty 
 Know you're wrong, know you're wrong, ooh yeah 
 Days prayin' on my knees 
 We made it from the feet, yeah 
 Then this leech came along 
 Know you're wrong, oh 
 You want me do the work, then you live off my life 
 Know you're wrong, huh 
 Say you got my back but revealin' snake eyes 
 Know you're wrong, huh 
 When I was doin' bad, wasn't textin' my phone 
 Know you're wrong 
 Oh now you wonder what, what 
 What you wonder? Huh 
 Call me, yeah 
 Know you're wrong, oh 
 Rappin' my ass off, nigga 
 You're tryna blur my picture 
 Want me down there with you 
 Tryna blow my high 
 You wanna steer my drive 
 You ask for more than my moms 
 Try corruptin' my mind 
 Do some work with them rhymes 
 When I was broke, you was gone 
 Know you're wrong, oh I 
 Know you're wrong, oh I 
 Say words can't express what you do for me when you appear 
 And don't be blind to see my love is the punch you shouldn't feel 
 Say words can't express what you do for me when you appear 
 And don't be blind to see my love is the punch you shouldn't feel 
 Say girl jump in my bank account 
 So I can deposit you 
 I'm goin' through withdrawals 
 And I can't afford to lose 
 Say girl jump in my bank account 
 So I can deposit you 
 I'm goin' through withdraws 
 And I can't afford to lose 
 Plasma my TV screen 
 Hope I go out like BB King 
 The front row, they cheer for God 
 I'm sold out on everything 
 Last night, it was a dream 
 Thinkin' 'bout you in the worst way 
 I need your cake like it's your birthday 
 I'm tryna be in front the TIME page 
 Yeah she rockin' with the big dog 
 I need my bread like it's the 5th floor 
 Little lettuce, slice of cheese, sucka please 
 What it's hittin' for 
 Let's split the middle like a Philly roll 
 I get a half, you get a half 
 Fuck up some commas, I'm a nympho 
 I'm goin' in just like a dimple 
 Shots of Patr√≥n to the temple 
 Collard greens, I stay givin' thanks 
 Deposit your love, we gon' flood the bank 
 Wish away, never lose 
 Lose 
 Now what we do be up to you, baby 
 Keep you up past your curfew, lady 
 Then drive you home with some drive through dome, baby 
 Keep you out tonight, drinks on, lady 
 Now what we do be up to you, baby 
 Keep you up past your curfew, lady 
 Then drive you home with some drive through dome, baby 
 Keep you out tonight, drinks on, lady 
 No sacrifice 
 Girl, just bein' precise 
 With my hands on the wheel 
 While you plant the device
