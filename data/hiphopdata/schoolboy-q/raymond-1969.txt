They say the gangsters back, kid got a heart attack 
 Straight out insomniac, let's get this fucker live 
 Loadin up pistols while gettin' high 
 45 nine, we smoking sitting in nickels and dimes 
 My little nigga 12 said he with it, yeah 
 Gave him a sherm stick and watched him while he hit it 
 Soon as he lit it cause was finished, now cock back the gat 
 Little mask and gloves, let's get to buisiness 
 But they worry about Osama 
 Killed a bitch nigga and get his family manana 
 Didn't get a coma nor a cent for the karma 
 Just an imaginary stripe so he can hold his head in honor 
 Zombie land a bunch of dead men walkin' 
 Livin' abortion they oughta raise the price on coffins 
 Fucking make a killing but I ain't dying up in prison 
 Fully loaded clip my brain up to the ceiling 
 Money-money, hoes, clothes, nigga that's all we know 
 Murder-murder, kill get your fucking cap peeled 
 Fear around here, I smell death around here 
 Don't be snooping 'round here, get dogged around here 
 They say 2012 the world gon end 
 Shit it been over since Raymond recruited soldiers 
 1969 evolution of devils time 
 Ain't walking up in no shrine shit I'm living a life of crime 
 Pops never gave a chance my mom crying 
 She can see it in my eyes, I lost my mind 
 Sneakin out the window with angel dust in my endo 
 Keys to her ignition new mission ya betta limbo 
 Fire pits let to eject I hardly miss 
 Nigga ditch sleep on my dog ain't that a bitch? 
 And I ain't on my Odd Future tip 
 But snatch a nigga intestines from his nose and tell his ass to shit 
 But they worry about Osama 
 Blood and Crip niggas lifetime of Jeffery Dhamers 
 Flashy for the moment I'm on it I pop your collar 
 Suicidal ain't fucking with these young connivers, we rivals 
 Money-money, hoes, clothes, nigga that's all we know 
 Murder-murder, kill get your fucking cap peeled 
 Fear around here, I smell death around here 
 Don't be snooping 'round here, get dogged around here 
 Didn't learn to much in school 
 But out I learned some shit, 36 a kilo 28 grams a zip 
 Pot brownies and white cookies 
 Cops'll pat me down but won't touch on my girls tooshi 
 Fuck they sent the lady cop they tryna book me 
 All else fails balloon packs tampon that pussy 
 Back to the set to laugh about it and get it off 
 Lobster tails and butter sauce same clothes still a boss 
 On a mothafuckin' robbing spree 
 Probably be televised, bitch I want the world to see 
 Now you dumb fuckas heard of him 
 Sickest nigga out I found out that blood's burgundy 
 But they worry about Osama 
 9/11 passengers ain't seen this type of drama 
 Vietnam wars I'm sending copper galore 
 Bodies hit the floor god knows I'm playing lord for sure 
 Money-money, hoes, clothes, nigga that's all we know 
 Murder-murder, kill get your fucking cap peeled 
 Fear around here, I smell death around here 
 Don't be snooping 'round here, get dogged around here 
 Make money, make money-money-money 
 Take money, take money-money-money 
 Make money, steal money-money-money 
 Kill money, my money-money-money
