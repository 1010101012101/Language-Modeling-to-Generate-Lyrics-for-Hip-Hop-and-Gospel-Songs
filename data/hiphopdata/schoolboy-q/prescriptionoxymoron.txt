Prescription drugs, show me love 
 Percocets, Adderall 
 Xanny bars, get codeine involved 
 Stuck in this body high, can't shake it off 
 I'm falling off, I can't hold a thought 
 What's wrong with me? Now the pressure creep 
 I'm stressing deep, even in my sleep 
 My mommy call, I hit ignore 
 My daughter calls, I press ignore 
 My chin press on my chest, my knees press the floor 
 I'm blanking out, woke up on the couch 
 Dinner on my shirt, my stomach hurts 
 I had a bust out in the 80's but yo, the karma's worse 
 I cry when nothing's wrong, I'm mad when peace is involved 
 My senses harmed, sluggish ruggish 
 A couple Xannies popped, open my pill box 
 Prescription drugs 
 What's wrong, daddy?! Wake up! Wake up! 
 Prescription drugs, I fell in love 
 My little secret, she gon' kill a thug 
 My body numb, she like to give me hugs 
 I love her touch, I get a rush 
 When she don't come around, I start to go nuts 
 My heart erupts, I'm curled in pain 
 My phone ring, ring and ring and ring 
 If you ain't selling drugs, then I don't hear a thing 
 May 7, Ali calls, p.m. of 6: 45, I finally answer this time 
 He said "Come to the stu', I'm mixing all your rhymes" 
 I don't decline, at least that's in my mind 
 Grab the keys, need some wood for the trees 
 Dap the clerk 'fore I leave, max on my AC 
 Continue right, remember seeing light 
 Wise night, but that's my life 
 Prescription drugs 
 What's wrong you tired? You mad? OK I love you daddy 
 I just stopped selling crack today 
 I just stopped selling crack today 
 O-X-Y, a moron 
 O-X-Y, a moron 
 Crazy, got my sex on wet in her Mercedes 
 Ladies, get these off new shoes for my baby 
 Oxy, I don't know no Pablo or no papi 
 What you know about a pill, plus a 8-ball 
 You gotta reel 50 times just to get a rack off 
 Ungh, I can get a hundred of 'em, make over 3 G's 
 Only took two days, only read it one time, with his son, belly shine 
 In the rain for about nine months out the year '97 right here 
 For Seattle nigga, cheers 
 When I look up at y'all city 
 Like lookin' in the mirror, damn near had a career 
 Just might shed a tear 
 Ungh, yo, man this shit right here 
 For my niggas who ain't make it home, sitting on a tear 
 Got a dap to a nigga bright in here 
 Feeling life ain't fair 
 If I was in your shoes I would've copped, don't care 
 Had a scene, had the medics like {clear} 
 Ungh, big body cold like a Polar Bear 
 Ungh, I done sold more shit than hookers 
 Expensive tees, resemble a push up 
 Stopped selling crack, cause white don't fuck with niggas 
 Vanity slave, got whips and chains 
 Dirty money, clean money the same 
 Even if I got life, I ain't saying a name 
 I just stopped selling crack today 
 I just stopped selling crack today 
 O-X-Y, a moron 
 O-X-Y, a moron 
 Groovy, when I die tell Spike Lee make a movie 
 Oh wee, cops bringing dogs so they don't sniff my bitch booty 
 Oxy, O-X-Y, only feel like I could stop me 
 Quincy, now how you nigga sliding up every now and then in a Bentley? 
 Easy, 60-40-50, you can get one for 30 if you let me hook this titty 
 Let a nigga fuck then my dogs see your kitty 
 Just stopped selling crack today 
 When it get hot, smoke a pill, watch it glide like Dr.J 
 I prescribe you I'm your doctor kay? 
 You can crush this shit, you can sniff this shit 
 You can take this shit, you can smoke this shit 
 Do you like this shit, nigga? 
 Your brain go numb, synthetic heroine 
 Without the injections, do the same love and affection 
 How could they say feeling good is an addiction? 
 But the world is full of shit so I don't listen 
 In fact "we livin' to die" is a contradiction 
 So trapping in a Nissan, O-X-Y, I keep 'em, O-X-Y, you need one 
 I just stopped selling crack today 
 I just stopped selling crack today 
 O-X-Y, a moron
