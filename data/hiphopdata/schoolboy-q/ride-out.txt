Ride out, big smoke 
 Re-up, big dope 
 Gs up, hoes blow 
 Freeze up, eyes closed 
 Ride out, big smoke 
 Re-up, big dope 
 Gs up, hoes blow 
 Freeze up, eyes closed 
 Young nigga and I'm proper like 
 Couple hundred thousand on me, nigga, yeah I'm baller like 
 Bitch I think I'm Dolemite, bitch I'm goin' poltergeist 
 Who said this was overnight? Album four is really like 
 Crippin' on my minibike 
 Either hoop or sellin' white 
 Brillo pad, the smoker's pipe 
 My pistol cocked, you tryna fight? 
 Say he wanna be a 'cause, put his brains to the right 
 Bruh, this ain't the eighties, mane 
 Niggas shootin' everything, everything 
 You know the gang we represent 
 Specialize in pistol grips 
 Shootin' out my momma's whip 
 Always got an empty clip 
 Top Dawg in this bitch 
 Nigga's puttin' dicks inside your baby momma's momma's lips 
 Shootin' all the witnesses, it ain't no fuckin' murder scene 
 Crips don't fuck with Crips oh now it's jeans that look like the rival team 
 Wrong hat and shoes, put your ass on a forever dream 
 Heatin' up the summer till the winter fall, spring clean 
 Ride out, big smoke 
 Re-up, big dope 
 Gs up, hoes blow 
 Freeze up, eyes closed 
 Ride out, big smoke 
 Re-up, big dope 
 Gs up, hoes blow 
 Freeze up, eyes closed 
 Young nigga and I'm proper like 
 Couple hundred thousand on me, nigga, yeah I'm baller like 
 Bitch I think I'm Dolamite, bitch I'm goin' poltergeist 
 Who said this was overnight? Me and Vince, we craccin' like 
 Crippin' in our afterlife 
 Yeah, 'cause at Ramona Park we beef with everybody 
 Light or dark I'll spark, don't fuck with narcs 
 So don't be talkin' 'bout me 
 My big homie name me get 'em, kill 'em 
 'Cause if I got 'em I'ma kill 'em, I ain't playin' with 'em 
 I'm from the bottom, that's the top of the town 
 We on the border so they cliquing up for knockin' us down 
 My burner tucked, I learned from Chuck so I ain't turnin' it down 
 Get to bussin', know you bluffin' it, nigga 
 If that bitch can't make me rich then ain't no need in fuckin' with her 
 Turn around and fuck her sister 
 Heard that bitch, got EBT 
 Long Beach ain't seen shit like me 
 Since Tracy D and DPG I went and got a burner 
 On the day they murdered Baby D 
 I'm in that Benz with Lil Boy 
 So lil boy don't play with me 
 I'm ridin' cycs through Hoover Street, my knuckles full of teeth 
 Try to creep on me, you're dyin' in your homie's seat 
 Keeping to my gun in reach 
 Fillet the beef, clip reach from Figg side to Norfolk Beach 
 In a stolen Expedition, in your hood 'cause you the mission 
 Been a mathematician, load nine, subtracted eight 
 I'm keepin' one for just in case, don't cover face but I ain't trippin' 
 Blunt was laced, niggas know I'm 'round the way 
 So ain't no liquor stores today 
 Ride out, big smoke 
 Re-up, big dope 
 Gs up, hoes blow 
 Freeze up, eyes closed 
 Ride out, big smoke 
 Re-up, big dope 
 Gs up, hoes blow 
 Freeze up, eyes closed

 You said this was overnight, me and Vince, we crackin' like 
 Crippin' in our afterlife 
 Ride, ride, ride, ride 
 Ride, ride, ride, big dope
