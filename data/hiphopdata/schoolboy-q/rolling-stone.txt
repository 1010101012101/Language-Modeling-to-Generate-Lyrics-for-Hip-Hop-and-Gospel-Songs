Drugs and girls 
 Uh, show me some love, my love 
 Last time I checked, you loved my love 
 Placed nothing above my love 
 If you leave, come back, like above your butt 
 No ifs, ands or buts 
 Yes I'm fishing, but I still wanna fill you up 
 "When the love runs high" 
 Hah, just when you thought enough was enough 
 I'm a kid in a museum and I just wanna touch 
 Every part of your body, tie you up and get naughty 
 Hoe, we up in this party, HiiiPoWeR, money showers 
 All the ladies wanna kick it with Mr. Miyagi 
 Pull up, pull up, bring it back, come rewind 
 I wanna touch up and down your spine 
 "When the love runs high" 
 Hmm, a perfect ten living on cloud nine 
 I like to drink all the time, fuck all the time 
 Anything that can get me out of my mind 
 I'm a rolling stone who needs another home 
 Especially "when the love runs high" 
 (Now everybody in the place) 
 Tote, tote, tote, tote 
 Tote, tote, tote, tote 
 (Do it till you can't feel your face) 
 Chug, chug, chug, chug 
 Chug, chug, chug, chug 
 (Everybody in the place) 
 Tote, tote, tote, tote 
 Tote, tote, tote, tote 
 (Do it till you can't feel your face) 
 Chug, chug, chug, chug 
 (Now stop, and just groove) 
 Uh, faded off life 
 See the dope man, time to get right 
 Uh, open up a Bud Light 
 Don Julio, Coronas, comas 
 Bad bitches, bad bitches 
 Calling bad bitches, bring your friend to be a witness 
 Uh, "when the love runs high" 
 Pfft, whatever that mean 
 Uh, need a shot, you the vaccine 
 You pumping through my veins, I'm a crack fiend 
 Uh, you're the crack 
 Uh, drive your ass all night, meet the chauffeur 
 Bend you over in a Rover, it's over 
 Never sober, my cup runneth over 
 "When the love runs high" 
 Better know girl, you fucking with a soldier 
 I like to drink all the time, fuck all the time 
 Anything that can get me out of my mind 
 I'm a rolling stone who needs another home 
 Especially "when the love runs high" 
 (Now everybody in the place) 
 Tote, tote, tote, tote 
 Tote, tote, tote, tote 
 (Do it till you can't feel your face) 
 Chug, chug, chug, chug 
 Chug, chug, chug, chug 
 (Everybody in the place) 
 Tote, tote, tote, tote 
 Tote, tote, tote, tote 
 (Do it till you can't feel your face) 
 Chug, chug, chug, chug 
 (Now stop, and just groove) 
 Blunts and broads 
 Drinking on liquor that's hard, oh my God 
 Baby tryna grab my drawers 
 They call me Dozer, I knock down walls 
 Jose, that's my homie 
 He'll have you calling Earl in a hallway 
 "When the love runs high" 
 I gotta come down just to party 
 I'm turned up, maxed out 
 Willie Manchester, blow your back out 
 Baby girl, my advice, better back out 
 Got that dope stick, I'm the crack house 
 Listen ma, I got a role you can act out 
 And then like Prince' pants, get yo' ass out 
 I don't need a princess, I need a mistress 
 I'll stick a dick in a damsel in distress 
 'Soul! 
 I like to drink all the time, fuck all the time 
 Anything that can get me out of my mind 
 I'm a rolling stone who needs another home 
 Especially "when the love runs high" 
 (Now everybody in the place) 
 Tote, tote, tote, tote 
 Tote, tote, tote, tote 
 (Do it till you can't feel your face) 
 Chug, chug, chug, chug 
 Chug, chug, chug, chug 
 (Everybody in the place) 
 Tote, tote, tote, tote 
 Tote, tote, tote, tote 
 (Do it till you can't feel your face) 
 Chug, chug, chug, chug 
 (Now stop, and just groove)
