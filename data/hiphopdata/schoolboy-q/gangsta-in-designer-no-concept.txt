Bad bitch, long hair, skin pretty, curvy ass 
 Flat stomach, double D's, please, be the Birkin bag 
 Designer heels, Hermes pants, how you fit in that? 
 Look at me - Ray Bans, I ain't tryna see you fags 
 Jean jacket, different coloured pants, I ain't tryna match 
 Mauve watch, sagging, see my ass popping thirty tags 
 Okay, I'm energized, say my tunes turn her on 
 This ain't Enterprise, but kick it boo, let's bring it home 
 I'm hella high, back to back, I smoke alone 
 Unless my nigga Soul around, fuck it 'cause, let's blow a zone 
 Now carry on assume you niggas need a loan 
 Quit it with the texting cuh and go and make a song 
 My foreign ho, bitch call me a maric√≥n 
 Always rocking shit I never seen or I never known 
 Name grown overseas fitter 
 Sergio Tacchini shirt, real creeper slippers 
 YSL see the logo on my zipper 
 Broad serving me she going down, yeah I had to tip her 
 A-ten-hut

 This for my HOG's on Figg and homies on the tier 
 Always keep this shit groovy nigga and I ain't shed a tear 
 Black gat, black whip no tags on it 
 Face tats 'cause for sure gon' throw the mask on it 
 Burner on my lap nigga, mothafuck the cops 
 DEA and all the feds gon' be my murder plot 
 Money cash hoes by the dozen 
 Never started cracking, bitches started cooking onions 
 Now my weed habit always funded 
 And these college broads be fucking do whatever have 'em flunking

 Bitch say she like my songs, so I do her 
 She love a street nigga that done jumped up out the cooler 
 Uh, young-ass entrepreneur 
 In the 40/40 club tripping like I ain't from Hoover 
 No bottles, no tables, I just wanna fuck you 
 You, you and you, yeah, they know what's up 
 Only one at a time, baby, slow it down 
 Just wait up in the front and listen to the sounds 
 She doin' all the things you say she say do 
 Swallow evidence, her boyfriend never had a clue 
 Sticking to the script like mothafuckin' glue 
 Got your birdie on my wood like the bitches from the Lou
