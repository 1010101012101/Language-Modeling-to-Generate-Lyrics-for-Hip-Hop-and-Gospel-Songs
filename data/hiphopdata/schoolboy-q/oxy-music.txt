Yeah; I got my hustle dog 
 I gets my hustle off, oxycontin hero-oine 
 Cra-zay; I got my chopper dog 
 Don't make me chop him off 
 Chop chop chop chop, knock him off 
 Blood on the wall, death in the air 
 Birds on the ground, pistols everywhere 
 Devil's in the eyes, babies always cry 
 Poppa never home, fuck it we all alone 
 Tryin' to get rich yeah that talkin' right 
 Grab me the beaker I'll measure the white 
 Heat up the water, drop it in pot 
 Baking soda and ice cubes make it rock 
 Get you a saucer the razor go chop 
 Get you a Glock and invest in a block 
 Set up your shop, dare 'em to pop 
 Fucked by the cop jacked his ass with a shot 
 Ya ya! 
 Yeah; I got my hustle dog 
 I gets my hustle off, oxycontin hero-oine 
 Cra-zay; I got my chopper dog 
 Don't make me chop him off 
 Chop chop chop chop, knock him off 
 Cra-zay; I got my hustle dog 
 I gets my hustle on, prostitutes and raps and all 
 Cra-zay; I got my chopper dog 
 Don't make me chop him off 
 Knock knock knock knock, knock him off 
 Satan in your soul, let it take control 
 Oxycontin fiends, keep the foil low 
 Let the pill burn, inhale exhale it slow 
 Let your heart explode, drop you to the flo' 
 I gets the dough, I hustle hard 
 Ace Hood ain't got shit on moi 
 Green beans, 80's for sure 
 They like what I'm talkin' bout 
 You know what I'm talkin' bout? 
 No syringes or nothin' just heroins cousin smoke mufflers out 
 Yeah; I got my hustle dog 
 I gets my hustle off, oxycontin hero-oine 
 Cra-zay; I got my chopper dog 
 Don't make me chop him off 
 Chop chop chop chop, knock him off 
 Cra-zay; I got my hustle dog 
 I gets my hustle on, prostitutes and raps and all 
 Cra-zay; I got my chopper dog 
 Don't make me chop him off 
 Knock knock knock knock, knock him off 
 Only Lords knows, and only time'll tell 
 Will I got to heaven, or will I burn in hell? 
 Music in my mind, vibratin down my spine 
 Travels to my heart, shoulda been here from the start 
 Now I get bread for my audio 
 (Call me your pusher these bars that I'm pushin) 
 You know I ain't talkin' a Xanny bro 
 (Nigga we on it be up by the mornin) 
 You wreck a new bitch wearin panties though 
 (Threw out my line) Fished up for sho' 
 (Nigga we eatin) You oughts to know 
 (Put my big boy in her) nebulo 
 There she blows, #HiiPower controllin 
 Our hustle keep goin' sh-shittin on niggaz 
 Excuse all our colons, boss after boss 
 Don't be pissed that we ballin we here for the moment 
 (We gettin' this cash) My flows be imported 
 My bitch be imported, my grind get distorted 
 Your life get deported, ch-ch-ch-ch-choppers deployin 
 Loosin my brain while recordin on
