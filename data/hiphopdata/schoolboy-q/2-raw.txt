Aye groove the window down oh shit I'm getting high 
 Still I'm cool... No AC needed 
 Probly slidin down ya region off this henney got me leanin 
 Ain't no secret that we ballin and yo ho be refereeing 
 Bet I make that pussy whistle up and down that booty dribble 
 Was she foul? Just a little, tech-nical how she nibble uh 
 Ain't fuckin' with you losers all my niggas won 
 It's mista bet I got sum weed, aye split another one 
 Look down upon the ceiling 
 Just try to reach the sky 'cause when you up they all be kneeling 
 Contradictions in my thoughts and I just execute my feelings 
 Shake the nonbelievers off I'm tryna navigate a million 
 But yo first lets hit the store you know I love Korean 
 She tell me hurry up and buy, I hurry up I'm fiendin 
 So I zip that, chop that, pass the blunt 
 Know my dick from last month but there's more to come, what the fuck? 
 2, 2 fucking raw (Face down, ass up) 
 Heroin, extacy, oxycontin, vicodin, coca cola everything up in our jeans 
 Even methamphetamines 
 Get this bread by any means 
 Pcp, lsd, transactions frequently 
 Turn ya job into a ki 
 Turn that ki into a beach 
 Turn that beach into ur sleep 
 Rest ya head, remain neat 
 Haters love to hate a G 
 Gossip on ya bakery 
 Wish they had the recipe 
 Swear this life is meant for me 
 Tired of crackin' niggas heads in the stolen challenger 
 Hopped up out the passenger and merked the DA's messenger 
 Every corner, camera 
 Nigga I'm just tryna live 
 Shitty on a shitty curb 
 Niggas can ya front ya kids 
 See how niggas get it in 
 Trappin so we live in sin 
 This felony won't keep me in I'm hungry gotta rob again 
 Embarrassing my mom and them 
 Grandma braggin to her friends 
 Killin' beef, apparently 
 Name a nigga rare as me 
 Yeah I be, 2 fuckin' raw 
 2, 2 fucking raw (Face down, ass up) 
 Got me swagged 
 Then I put yo style in a body bag 
 Man I'm off a bag of that good 
 My flow off a pile of pack 
 Man I'm leanin hard, like I'm off that sy-RUP 
 And I'm damn near tore up 
 Wit my dogs and locstas 
 And we all got stock like brokers 
 Ugh, we don't chase hoes, nah 
 Hoes gon chase us, yeah 
 Straight to the condo 
 Yeah bitches ain't shit that's the muhhfuckin motto 
 In the monte carlo 
 Yeah sippin on carlo 
 Just me and my posse 
 Strapped up when you gotta know the ropes like ted dibiase 
 Look at my life raw, NIGGA 
 Bitches wanna suck me off, QUICKER 
 Haters can't stand my guts, NIGGA 
 'Cause I get my bucks, BIGGER 
 I'm on my own, I'm in my zone 
 Bitch niggas can't knock me off my throne 
 I'm on my shit, 'cause septic tanks 
 I don't give a fuck what set you claim 
 Just get yo money let the bullshit walk 
 Ima get this cheese like a lil rat bitch 
 Fuckin' suck me good 
 Nibbling through her team 
 Raw shit
