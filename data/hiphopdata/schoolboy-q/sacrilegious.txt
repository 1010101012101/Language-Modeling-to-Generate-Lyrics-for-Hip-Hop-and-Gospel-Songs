Gloomy on sunny days 
 Shadows no house or trees 
 Prayers now close to me as I bow down and take a knee 
 Hell goes far as the eye can see 
 Hoodies and weaponry 
 Na√Øve to being free 
 Locked up, we chasing keys 
 How ya eyes investigate us 
 While we look up to entertainers, ball players, pistol bangers 
 Big brothers, uncles, uncles 
 Betrayed by a lot of homies, all my friendships stay on shuffle 
 Huddles, steady find a plan, spread evil beyond the land 
 As I clench down upon this trigger 
 The burn fuckin' burn 
 Every step to getting deeper 
 Survival my main concern 
 Marinating in Satan's sweat, take a sip of this holy water 
 Hoping god still keep me blessed 
 With a dark shield for my armor 
 Promises man I promised 
 None of them goals accomplished 
 Promises man I promised 
 To be loyal and honest 
 Promises man I promised 
 Lied on separate occasions 
 Promises man I promised 
 My promises is aging 
 Hennessy what my system like 
 Feeling like superman 
 I might crip tonight 
 I bring loss to life 
 A gruesome site 
 Look who done got involved 
 Its no different from wars, its kill or be called upon 
 Feeling teary eyed, thinking I've gone too far 
 Ask god for forgiveness, shit I doubt he heard me at all 
 They say clean your hands before you eat, rest your sins with pray 
 But I've done did some things I don't think I could ever wash away
