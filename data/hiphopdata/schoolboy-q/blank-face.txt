Who you tellin'? 
 Blank faces 
 Smokers and dope fiends, hookers and playas 
 Dope in the vein, young and servin' the meds 
 Run from the police, jump from the ledge 
 Be what you wanna be as long as you get the money right, yeah 
 Niggas don't understand until you leap over 25 
 Dancin' with devils, never knew how to treat your woman right, yeah 
 Feet on the pedal runnin' over jokers and funny tops 
 Word to my OG, he gone, that nigga fresh out of strikes 
 I should know better, Heaven knows that I ain't the dummy type, nah 
 I should be flyin' home without a care 
 My baby don't want no toys, she want me there 
 I trade the noise for a piece of divine 
 I savor my coins for a piece of the land, ah 
 Something to pass while I'm passin' my prime 
 My word in the cards, full deckk in my hand 
 As sure as the smog is pollutin' the land 
 Be what you wanna be as long as you get the money right, yeah 
 Uh... wise as my Chevy 
 My life's so fucked up the drank don't get me buzzed 
 We ain't blood and they killed my 'cause 
 Chuckin' Cs since I was a cub 
 Young nigga grew up on hate but where's the love? 
 Ash and dubs on 
 Niggas don't understand until you leap over 25 
 Dancin' with devils 
 Guess you would say I'm one of the lucky type 
 No! 
 Fuck you thought? 
 Playin' tooth fairy, Santa before I'm buried 
 Easter egg Huntin', pickin' seeds out the pumpkin 
 Six years straight the valentine for my munchkin 
 I made a queen outta nothin' 
 Told me stay in school, my dream was just a small percentage 
 Said a million wasn't realistic 
 Last year I spent it, what's the laws of physics? 
 Move pounds or move down to Section 8 livin' 
 Grew up around Crippin', Woo business 
 And if I never make it to 25 I swear to God I'm still gon' fly, nigga 
 But it's still my time, nigga 
 Tell me who gon' fly with me? 
 Yeah! 
 Who gon' ride with ya? 
 Who gon' fly with ya? 
 It's still my time, yeah 
 It's still my time, nigga, yeah
