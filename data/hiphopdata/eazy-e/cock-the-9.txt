 Here's the latest 
 From the king of badness 
 I got the shit that makes niggaz wanna flip 
 G'd up all better wit beanies 
 Sweatin all the bitches to blow are weanies 
 Niggaz all getting drunk, and smoking a bum bud 
 Oh wait here's a punk, pump the trunk 
 'Cause it's a gang of jackers in the front smoking 
 All the hump, some shit was said about blue and red 
 But I'm colour blind and I gotta nine 
 Threw up the sign I cock the 9, I cock the 9. 
 (Loco S.A.B) 
 Well nigga pop the 9and let it holla 
 Test drive wit a neighbourhood's scholar 
 Black Impaler, blue chucks on gettin' outta 
 Sucks on hip hop thugsta get the fuck on 
 Niggaz looking shifty, do they wanna diss me, lick me 
 Show me love or peel my cap quickly 
 My six sense won't let me slip don't puff wit the draggin em 
 I'm still toe taggin em, hit the spot wit a don still baggin em 
 It's the low call, S.A.B on the vocal, blast my way out eazy pay 
 The way, all you bitch niggaz stay out 
 I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 (and everything is fine) 
 I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 (my homey pop the 9) 
 I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 (*gun shot*) 
 I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 (my homey pop the 9)

 It's like dice game, dice game niggaz get they roll'on 
 Everything's all good till niggaz getting sold on 
 Here we all get together and shoot, fuck 
 I grab my gun then I picked up my loot 
 But I didn't lose shit so it's all good 
 Leavin' pumpin Eazy-E "Boyz 'n' the Hood" 
 'Cause I'm a gangsta so I can relate, most of these 
 Niggaz is fake and tryin' to hate 
 I put a buster in his place, I put one in his face 
 Obey my first and give him the taste 
 That's how I duz it, that's how I do it 
 And the murder weapon that I use you know I threw it 
 He kept persuading so I had to do it, 'uh' play 
 For keeps that's the rule of the streets 'uh'. 
 (Loco S.A.B) 
 Dick Tracy all on my nuttz like Cagny and Lacy 
 And don't faze me, Ruthless is the label that pays me 
 But this one H.K weighs a ton, words are yellow wit 
 The ??? freaks on a run, bring ya condom in the kingdom 
 Huh ho from the ceilin to the floor, info red at ya window 
 Plus the E go hangin' out the beamer tho 
 Drop shit like a seagull, for the people 
 Ho's make a contribution, but y'all don't hear me tho. 
 (Eazy-E) 
 Tuck ya legs to my dick with the wrap 'em real tight 
 Just incase its on and a nigga gotta fight, an a 
 Nigga gotta bust, but who in the fuck said in god we trust 
 The shit wen't down everybody start runnin' 
 Bitches screamin and the bullets still comin' 
 Run into a nigga tryin' to save mine, reach for my gun ah shit!
