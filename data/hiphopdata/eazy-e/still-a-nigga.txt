spoken: 
 Straight off the streets of Compton 
 Dedicated and by most suckers hated 
 But I got somethin' I want you motherfuckers to know 
 I really don't give a fuck 
 Born and raised 
 Niggas ain't shit in the '90s, I don't trust 'em 
 And bitches on my dick like they ain't shit so motherfuck 'em 
 Eazy know what's up 'cause Eazy really don't give a fuck 
 It don't concern me if it don't pertain to money or a nut 
 But then again I talk to a few of my friends 
 Nine times outta ten 'bout some ends or some skins 
 'Cause I'm the type of nigga that got to have it like a rabbit 
 Rappin' is my hustle, bustin' hoes is a habit 
 I stab it like a true no good nigga should 
 I do it the way a down OG nigga would 
 And now niggas know Eric Wright ain't no buster 
 Another platinum cut from the Compton thugster 
 My name is 
 (Eazy-E, babe) 
 spoken: 
 Eazy motherfuckin' E, a real nigga, born and raised in motherfuckin' Compton 
 This one is dedicated to you buster-ass niggas 
 You know who you are 
 Smoke a fat ass joint to this, bitch 
 I don't think I'm all this or that, but I'm all me 
 Original gangsta E-A-Z-Y-E 
 Down from the jump now I'm endin' with a bizzang 
 Still rollin' in my six-four on them thizzangs 
 Doin' wicked shit 'cause shit is wicked on the streets 
 And from what my eyes see the wickedness will never cease 
 Bitches on my dick and you know I'm runnin' y'all 
 So you just sold your soul to the motherfuckin' devil's son-in-law 
 Wicked as could be, Eazy-E got the flow 
 Leavin' a smell of death on the row for sure 
 And a hoe can't make me or break me 
 But she can take me to a motel and work a nigga's spell 
 'Cause I'm 
 (Eazy-E, babe) 
 spoken: 
 Yeah, suck on these nuts, motherfuckers 
 Get with the real and quit fakin' the funk 
 And, oh yeah, stay off my dick 
 Really though 
 I let my demons loose when I hit the 8 juice 
 And I leave a trail of stiffs when I'm high off of spliffs 
 Niggas talk shit, so I talk a lot of shit too 
 Niggas wanna dis, fuck them and they whole crew 
 In fact, nigga, thank ya for stockin' a nigga's bank up 
 Yeah, I'm livin' square, but I'm a gangsta like Dresta 
 No, not the Doctor, physician, or the M.D. 
 Dresta's an OG, Doctor's a phony 
 Only the real real still can chill with me 
 And the rest can't fuck with E 
 'Cause I'm the OG that'll burn you down 
 The devil's son-in-law, king of the underground 
 Good to go with the flow that I throw 
 Givin' you mo' to let a motherfucker know, 
 That I can get wrecked on the set and make you slow 
 'Cause you know I ain't a joke, I'm a motherfuckin' loc' 
 And my name is 
 (Eazy-E, babe) 
 spoken: 
 Eazy motherfuckin' E, but you bitches can just call me Eazy 
 A real nigga from the CPT 
 Kickin' ass and askin' questions later 
 Oh yeah, don't get smoked, loc' 
 And I'm out, motherfuckers 
 (Eazy-E, babe)
