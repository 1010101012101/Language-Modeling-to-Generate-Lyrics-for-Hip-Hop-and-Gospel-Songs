Yo Ren, you're ready to go get this move? 
 (Believe that, boy) 
 You're strapped? 
 (Yeah, you know it) 
 Let's go do this, man, I got it all planned out 
 (Yeah, shoot any motherfucker that moves) 
 All right everybody... 
 This is a stick-up, everybody get face-down 
 Ren, gag their mouths so they can't make a sound 
 Tie 'em up for the fact that I'm kickin ass 
 I got my hand on my gat, and I'm tempted to blast 
 My name is Eazy, but I go the hard way out 
 This ain't personal, but now I'm about 
 To commit a crime and go through with it 
 You know what, no need for shakin, because I'm used to it 
 Take out the security guard with a slap of my hand 
 Yeah, he's wearin' a badge, but he's a ol ass man 
 Pump his ass in the head, and take his gun 
 So me and the punk can go one on one 
 Cover the lens on the TV screen 
 You know, so me and my gang just can't be seen 
 Lock the doors, and throw away the key 
 Close the blinds, so no motherfuckers can see 
 And smile, you know, 'cause I'm controllin the shit 
 And no sucker ass nigga's gonna stop the hit 
 Wardrobes and locs, and a Ruthless shirt 
 That means I'm ready to work, and rush a fool to the dirt, so 
 Nobody moves, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody moves, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody moves, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody moves, nobody get hurt 
 All right, anybody move and I'll blow your fuckin' head off 
 All right 
 Empty your pockets, but do it slow 
 Take everything you got and lay it on the fuckin' floor 
 Don't make me have to set an example today 
 And blow one of you crazy motherfuckers away 
 I'm in a bank and it's a little bit funny 
 Takin' all you stupid motherfuckers' money 
 Peepin at a bitch cause my dick's on hard 
 Laughin' at the dumb ass security guard 
 Who's tied up for the moment, not sayin' a word 
 I should have known it before, the motherfucker's a nerd 
 But back to the bitches I'm peepin 
 And then untie the hoe, so I can start creepin' 
 Took her to the backroom about to jack 
 Cold trailed the bitch, with a gun in the back 
 I said: "Lay down, and unbutton your bra!" 
 There was the biggest titties that a nigga ever saw 
 I said: "Damn", then the air got thinner 
 Only thought in my mind, was goin' up in her 
 The suspense was makin' me sick 
 She took her panties down and the bitch had a dick! 
 I said: "Damn", dropped the gat from my hand 
 (What I thought was a bitch, was nothing but a man) 
 Put the gat to his legs, all the way up his skirt 
 Because this is one faggot that I had to hurt, so 
 Nobody moves, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody moves, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody moves, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody moves, nobody get hurt 
 I said get down. I want you all face-down on the floor 
 Anybody moves and I shoot 
 Stackin up the money and there's more to collect 
 'Cause I don't give a fuck, I take traveler's checks 
 Yo, Ren, peep out the window, and tell me what you see 
 (Three motherfuckin police starin' at me; what to do now?) 
 Hurry up and get on 
 All right, tell me, who hit the motherfuckin alarm? 
 I'm a give ya a chance, and count to three 
 Or else five of y'all bitches are comin' with me 
 (Police: All right, All right, come on out niggaz, or we're coming in 
 This is the only chance to turn yourself in) 
 Fuck you! We got hostages, and plenty of loot 
 And don't give a damn and not afraid to shoot 
 We're sendin out the hostages, all except five 
 And if you don't meet our demands, they won't stay alive 
 We want a copter, so we can get away clean 
 And take some pussy along, if you know what I mean 
 One hostage got brave, and got off the floor 
 But I smoked his ass before he got to the door 
 (Police: They shot a hostage, they shot a hostage!) 
 (MC Ren: You stupid motherfucker tryin' to run 
 Now you're dead as fuck tryin' to race a gun) 
 (Police: All right, this is the last chance to get off your ass 
 Or else the tear gas is about to blast) 
 I ran to the back and Ren followed behind 
 To a hell of a spot that was hard to find 
 The bank was fucked up, the shit was smokin' 
 With screamin hostages, runnin' and chokin 
 Gettin' away, but I was suddenly stopped 
 At point blank range, by a motherfuckin cop 
 And I hope they don't think that a lesson was taught 
 Cause a nigga like the E was finally caught 
 My gat wouldn't fire, the shit wouldn't work 
 So, y'all know what time it is 
 Nobody moves, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody moves, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody moves, nobody get hurt 
 Nobody moves, nobody get hurt 
 (Police: Well I'm giving you five seconds to let us through the gate or 
 I'm gonna shoot two of your guards) 
 They got me once, but they'll never get me again
