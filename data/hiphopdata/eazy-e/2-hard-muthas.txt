 [Arguin'] 
 [M. C. Ren] 
 Give this nigga some sticks... 
 Yo Fuck it up Yella 
 [M. C. Ren] 
 Yo were two hard muthafuckaz 
 Takin' out any punk ass suckaz 
 Can you believe this or so be frightened 
 Were strong as fuck, with the power of a titan 
 Settin' a mark of destruction get it 
 So don't front, and say you ain't with it 
 You wanna rumble with us you can't hang 
 Cause were something like a two man gang 
 Start some shit is what we do best 
 Scared by the suckaz say fuck the rest 
 So yo Eazy bust it and shoot to kill 
 And tell these stupid muthafuckaz the deal 
 [Eazy-E] 
 I look you dead in the eye and I spit 
 Tell you to your face punk you ain't shit 
 I don't give a goddamn about feelin's 
 I'm just as a happy as long as I'm killin' 
 A 187 is in progress nigga 
 Just as soon as I pull this trigger 
 Automatic heavily I start firin' 
 And the kids on the block 
 I'm the one there admirin' 
 A bad mouth nigga on the violent tip 
 I catch you talkin' some shit 
 And I'mma bust your lip 
 Now who you gonna tell that I'm makin' ya soft 
 The police ain't shit 'cause I pay 'em off 
 I move slow always ready to go so fuck it 
 And bitches on my dick they know they can suck it 
 I'm a hard head, always havin' a fit 
 When I'm not allowed to tear up shit 
 [Eazy-E & M. C. Ren] 
 I'm a hard muthafucka 
 2 Hard Muthafuckaz! [x4] 
 [M. C. Ren] 
 Now look at me I'm a crazed bitch 
 With a case to a profanity pitch 
 Ren is a nigga that don't give a fuck 
 To pussy ass fool tryin' to press his luck 
 I'm ready to scrap that's if your ready to go 
 I take you out goin' toe to toe 
 E saw the conversion and hit you from the back 
 While you gettin' fucked by a ruthless jack 
 Critical condition is what you received 
 Thinkin' up some back up to go on retrieve 
 But Eazy tell what would happen my man 
 [Eazy-E:] "they would get fucked up by a ruthless clan" 
 So it's simple we don't give a fuck right 
 So you and ya boys can get the fuck out my site 
 I'm on tilt with class gettin' ready to blast 
 'Cause I'm a hard muthafucka 
 2 Hard Muthafuckaz! [x4] 
 [Eazy-E] 
 Eazy and Ren is fuckin' it up again 
 Schemin' up a plot before we begin 
 Cause niggaz like to stare like a bitch sometimes 
 They say how can them niggaz have some a hell of a rhyme 
 [M. C. Ren] 
 It's simple tell 'em what we mean 
 When the two baddest muthafuckaz step on the scene 
 [Eazy-E] 
 Now this is some shit 
 [M. C. Ren] 
 Yo what are you sayin' 
 [Eazy-E] 
 You stupid muthafuckaz they think I'm playin' 
 Talkin' all kinda shit of shit but I'm crackin' it up 
 I can afford to laugh 'cause I'm backin' it up 
 I'm not a busta I'm more like a hitman 
 So if you don't wanna throw then you can get down 
 You don't like the fuck away from me 
 So you can stop the shit, tryin' to fuck the E 
 [M. C. Ren] 
 You heard what he said 
 It's the truth so what's up 
 So if you want me to go then I'mma bout to nut up 
 The 2 baddest muthafuckaz alive 
 So I don't think you and your boys can survive 
 You gotta girl, well if she's good to go 
 I bet me and E already fucked the hoe 
 A train was in effect and your bitch was rott 
 By a hell of a nigga that was hard to stop 
 [Eazy-E]
