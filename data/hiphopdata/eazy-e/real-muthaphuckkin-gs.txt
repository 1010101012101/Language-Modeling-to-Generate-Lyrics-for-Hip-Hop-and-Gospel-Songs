 (Eazy-E) 
 Hey yo doctor, here's another proper track 
 And it's phat 
 Watch the sniper 
 Time to pay the piper 
 And let that real shit provoke 
 See, you's a wanna be loc' and you'll get smoked 
 And I hope that ya fans understand when ya talk about sprayin' me 
 The same records that ya makin' is payin' me 
 Muthaphuckk Dre, Muthaphuckk Snoop, Muthaphuckk Death Row 
 Yo, and here comes my left blow 
 'Cuz I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E, and this is the season 
 To let the Real Muthaphuckkin G's in 
 You're like a kid: ya found a pup and now ya dapper 
 But tell me where the fuck ya found an anorexic rapper 
 Talkin' about who you gon' squabble with and who ya shoot 
 You're only 60 pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots 
 (Gangsta Dresta: Damn, E, they tried to fade you on "Dre Day!") 
 But "Dre Day" only meant Eazy's pay day 
 All of a sudden Dr. Dre is a "G Thang" 
 But on his old album covers he was a she thang 
 So nigga please, nigga please, don't step to deez 
 Muthaphucckin' Real G's 
 Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless 
 "Yo Dre! ('Sup?)" *bang* 
 Boy, ya should have known by now 
 Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless 
 "Yo Dre! ('Sup?)" *bang* 
 Boy, ya should have known 
 (Gangsta Dresta) 
 Everyday it's a new rapper claimin' to be dapper than the Dresta 
 Softer than a bitch but portray the role of gangsta 
 Ain't broke a law in ya life 
 Yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife 
 Just take a good look at the nigga, and you'll capture 
 The fact that the master is simply just an actor 
 Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental 
 Of niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central 
 Never ever once have you ran with the turf 
 But yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt 
 But tell me who's a witness to your fuccin' work? 
 See, ya never had no bidness, so save the drama, jerk 
 Niggas straight kill me knowin' that they pranksters 
 This is going out to you studio gangstas 
 See, I did dirt, put in work, and many niggas can vouch that 
 So since I got stripes, I got the right to rap about that 
 But niggas like you, I kinda hate ya 
 Cause I'm just tired of suburbian niggaz talkin' about they come from projects 
 Knowin' ya ain't seen no parts of the streets, G 
 Think ya started tryna bang around the time of the peace treaty 
 Wearin' khakis and mob while ya rhyme 
 Little fag tryna sag, but you're floodin' at the same time 
 And ya set don't accept ya 
 Scared to kicc it with ya homies 'cuz ya know they don't respect ya 
 So nigga please check nuts before you step to deez muthafuccin Real G's 
 (B.G. Knocc Out) 
 Well, it's the Knocc Out, definition original baby gangsta 
 Approach me like you hard, muthafucca I'ma bank ya 
 Shank ya, with my fuccin' shank, if I hafta 
 Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuccin' actors 
 Pranksters, studio gangstas, busters 
 But this time ya dealin' with some real muthafuccas 
 Geez, nigga please, don't try to step 
 'Cuz if ya do, then a peeled cap is all that would be left 
 See young niggas like me will break you off somethin' 
 Claimin' my city, but Dre, you ain't from Compton 
 Niggas like y'all is what I call wannabes 
 And ain't shit compared to real muthafuccin' G's 
 Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless 
 Yo Dre! ('Sup?) *bang* 
 (Eazy-E) 
 I never met a OG who never did shit wrong 
 Ya tried to diss the Eazy-E so now, nigga, 
 It's On! 
 You and ya Doggy Dogg think that yer all hogging shit 
 Both of you bitches can come and suck my doggy dick 
 Beatin' up a bitch don't make ya shit, but then again 
 Some niggas think it makes a man 
 Damn, it's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick 
 From wearin' lipstick to smokin' on chronic at picnics 
 And now ya think yer bigger 
 But to me you ain't nothin' but a bitch-ass nigga 
 That ain't worth a food stamp 
 And at Death Row, I hear yer gettin' treated like boot camp 
 Gotta follow your Sergeant's directions 
 Or get your ass pumped with his Smith and Wesson 
 Learn a lesson from the Eaze: 
 Stay in your place and don't step to Real Muthaphuckkin G's 
 Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless 
 Yo Dre! ('Sup?) *bang* 
 Boy, ya should have known by now 
 Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless 
 Yo Dre! ('Sup?) *bang* 
 Boy, ya should have known by now 
 Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless 
 Yo Dre! ('Sup?) *bang*

 Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless 
 Yo Dre! ('Sup?) *bang*
