It's that man comin' up from that land of tha C-P-T 
 ("What's my motherfuckin name?" - Snoop) Eazy-E 
 Comin' through with a big lick for '94 
 Showin alla y'all them true-ass gangsta flows 
 So bow-wow bow-wow the big dog's in town 
 And them guts is the only thing a nigga pound 
 Laid back as I blow a fat sack 
 Hittin switches for them bitches, hittin corners in a Cadillac 
 So take a ride on tha ruthless side 
 With the E to the A-Z-Y 
 That nigga makin' more off yo hits than you do 
 You fools, need to recognize this crew when I roll through 
 Tryin' to speak up on tha OG, nigga you don't know me 
 Break 'em off these nuts lil wanna-be 
 'Cause I peel caps if need be 
 And ain't nothin' you gonna bring don't see me 
 Just tah let you know... 
 One more time for the rhyme again 
 Comin' from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N 
 One more time for the rhyme again 
 Comin' from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N
