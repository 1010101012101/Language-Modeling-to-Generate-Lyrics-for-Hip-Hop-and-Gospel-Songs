I'm 'bout to jump in! Splash! 
 I want to take a dip, dip inside your love 
 Underwater love, never comin' up 
 I want to take a dip, dip inside your love 
 Underwater love, never comin' up 
 I just went down 
 And never comin' up 
 I don't need air ba-a-by 
 Stay here between you ba-a-by 
 Got my things that I'm gon' need 
 'Cause I'm gonna stay off in you indeed 
 'Cause that's just me ba-a-by 
 'Cause that's just a me ba-a-by 
 Now the tide is rollin' in 
 I'm gonna take a swim 
 Inside your world ba-a-by (inside the love baby) 
 Inside your world ba-a-by 
 Got my safety suit on 
 Wit' that nothin' can go wrong 
 Splashing around ba-a-by (all around baby) 
 I'm gonna stay down here ba-a-by 
 Music, woman moaning, bridge: 
 Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo... Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo 
 Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo... Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo 
 Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo... Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo 
 Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo... Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo 
 Bridge 2, woman continues moaning: 
 Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo... Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo 
 Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo... Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo 
 Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo... Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo 
 Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo... Doodadoo, doo-doo, doo-doo 
 (Music fades out with bridge, water bubbling)
