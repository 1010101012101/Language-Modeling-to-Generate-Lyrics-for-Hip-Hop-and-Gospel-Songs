(Feat. Joi) 
 It's time to get freaked... oh it's time to get freaked... 
 It's time to get freaked... oh it's time to get freaked... 
 (Verse 1: Sleepy Brown) 
 Oh ho hum, I love it baby when you're goin' down with me (whoa) 
 Oh ho hum, your body feels so good I wish that 
 We, could stay like this forever 
 Oh ho hum, fingertips move across you so slowly (whoa) 
 Oh ho hum, the freakiness inside me wish that 
 We, can stay like this forever 
 (Chorus: Sleepy Brown and Joi][with ad-libs) 
 Mmmhmmhmm... whoa 
 Mmmhmmhmm... whoa 
 Mmmhmmhmm... whoa 
 Ooh... ooh ooh ooh... hmmm 
 (Verse 2: Joi) 
 Oh ho hum, I love it baby when you're goin' down on me (whoa) 
 Oh ho hum, My body feels so good I wish that 
 We, could stay like this forever 
 Oh ho hum, fingertips move across me so slowly (whoa) 
 Oh ho hum, the freakiness inside me wishes 
 We, could stay like this forever 
 (Chorus: Sleepy Brown and Joi][with ad-libs) 
 Mmmhmmhmm... whoa 
 Mmmhmmhmm... whoa 
 Mmmhmmhmm... whoa 
 Ooh... ooh ooh ooh... hmmm 
 (Bridge: Joi) 
 Oh ho hum... oh ho hum 
 Oh ho hum... 
 Ooh... ooh ooh ooh... hmmm 
 (Verse 3: Sleepy Brown and Joi) 
 Oh ho hum, I love it baby when you're goin' down with me 
 Oh ho hum, your body feels so good I wish that

 (Outro: Sleepy Brown and Joi) 
 Oh ho hum...
