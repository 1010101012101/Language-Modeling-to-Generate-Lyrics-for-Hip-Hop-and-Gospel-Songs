Ooh, such a beautiful night 
 It's time to party... time to party 
 Put that dress on that you know I like 
 The one that fitted right... that fitted right 
 Let's go baby yeah (come on baby) 
 Come on baby (let's go baby) 
 The car is waitin' (the car is waitin', car is waitin', car is waitin') 
 It's you and me tonight, just put your glass with mine 
 Let's toast to love and reach the sky 
 'Cause tonight baby 
 Let's leave our cares behind and just unwind (wind, wind) 
 I can give you what you like baby 
 'Cause you're so fine baby, love it when you 
 Dress... Up 
 (Saxophone solo][ad-libs) 
 Ooh, when we step off in the room 
 They look at you... they look at you 
 Just the sexy things you do (sexy, sexy) 
 You know ya do... ya know ya do 
 Come on baby yeah (come on baby) 
 Show 'em baby (show 'em baby) 
 You ain't playin' (you ain't playin', you ain't playin', you ain't playin') 
 Let's go and hit the floor (floor) and dance till we can't no more 
 And show the world who I adore, you baby 
 (Music, saxophone solo) 
 (Music to fade)
