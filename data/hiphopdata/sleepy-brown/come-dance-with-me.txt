Come dance with me... come dance 
 Come dance with me... come dance 
 Come dance with me... it's yo' chance 
 Come and dance with me... come dance 
 Come dance with me 
 I see you lookin' so sexy 
 Ah, baby why don't ya let me? 
 Get a little bit closer girl

 And, ooh, I like to hit the floor 
 And move (and move) with you (with you) 
 And, ooh, I think there's so much more 
 That I (that I) can do (can do) but for now just 
 Now ya know that I like it 
 Girl, got me so excited 
 Our bodies are so close on the dance floor 
 That I can't deny it 
 Come dance with me (come on baby) come dance with me (dance with me lady) 
 Come dance with me (dance with me) come dance with me (dance with me) 
 Come dance with me (come on laby) come dance with me (dance with me bady) 
 Come dance with me (dance with me) come dance with me (dance with me) 
 (Music to fade)
