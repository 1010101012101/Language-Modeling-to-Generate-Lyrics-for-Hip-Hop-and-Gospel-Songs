Yeah man, you know what I'm saying? Already 
 You crazy for this one! 
 Fresh out the belly of the island into the heart of the city 
 T and them just hit the road, I had Sage and Nak and 'em with me 
 I thought the fodder was pretty so I approached her 
 My first apartment was really covered with roaches 
 'Cause niggas was really smoking 
 Gotta say that as of late I been busy with business mostly 
 Got a tape? Catch a wave, now you in the industry ocean, missing out on your boat 
 I been figuring out my own fish, home gets distant 
 We working, I'm on the road again 
 Cold and his spirits is bursting up out the Trojan, man 
 Fridge full of spirits and the crib mirror mirror 
 Let me hear why the niggas that's the peers see and hear us then mimmick the fucking motions, man 
 Keep the circle closed, let them niggas front in the cul-de-sacs 
 Friendly with the chosen, the rest is getting the poker hand 
 Face-drinking smoker, it help me duck when emotion jab 
 Fame is the culprit who give me drugs without owing cash 
 Sipping till I melt, never trying me, I'm diving 
 Falling victim to myself, middle finger to the help 
 When it's problems I don't holler, rather fix 'em by myself 
 When it's looking like it's quiet for you this the shit to yell 
 This the shit right, yup, keep your chin high up 
 'Cause when she ain't fucking with you then her friend might 
 Let you get up inside, yup, let this shit ride 
 You don't get it rocking like we do on this side, nigga 
 I blow a spliff before the ink dries on the paper 
 And lately I don't like shit, I been inside on the daily
