Something sinister to it 
 A pendulum swinging slow 
 A degenerate moving 
 Through the city with criminal stealth 
 Welcome to enemy turf 
 Harder than immigrants work 
 "Golf" is stitched into my shirt 
 Get up off the pavement 
 Brush the dirt up off my psyche 
 Psyche, psyche 
 (Can I get that, oh) 
 (Let me get that beat in my headphones) 
 (Louder) 
 It's probably been twelve years since my father left 
 Left me fatherless 
 And I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest 
 When honestly I miss this nigga 
 Like when I was six 
 And every time I got the chance to say it 
 I would swallow it 
 Sixteen, I'm hollow, intolerant, skipped shots 
 I storm that whole bottle 
 I'll show you a role model 
 Drunk, pissy pissing on somebody front lawn 
 Trying to figure out 
 How and when the fuck I missed moderate 
 Momma often was offering peace offerings 
 Think, wheeze cough, scoffing and he's off again 
 Searching for a big brother, Tyler was that 
 Plus he liked how I rap 
 The blunted mice in the trap 
 Too Black for the White kids and too White for the Blacks 
 From honor roll to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks 
 I'm indecisive, I'm scatterbrained and I'm frightened, it's evident 
 And them eyes where he hiding all them icicles at 
 Something sinister to it 
 A pendulum swinging slow 
 A degenerate moving 
 Through the city with criminal stealth 
 Welcome to enemy turf 
 Harder than immigrants work 
 "Golf" is stitched into my shirt 
 Get up off the pavement 
 Brush the dirt up off my psyche 
 Psyche, psyche 
 (Can I get that, oh) 
 (Let me get that beat in my headphones) 
 (Louder) 
 Time lapse, bars rotten, heart's bottomless pit 
 Was mobbin' deep as '96 Havoc and Prodigy did 
 We were the potty-mouth posse, crash the party and dip 
 With all belongings, then toss 'em out to the audience 
 Nothing was fucking awesome, trying to make it from the bottom of Syd's 
 Feeling as hard as Vince Carter's knee cartilage is 
 Supreme garment and weed gardeners garnishing spliffs 
 With Keef particles and entering apartments with 'zine article 
 Tolerance through boundaries, I know you happy now 
 Craven and these Complex fuck niggas that track me down 
 Just to be the guys that did it, like I like attention 
 Not the type where niggas trying to get a raise at my expense 
 Supposed to be grateful, right, like thanks so much, you made my life 
 Harder and the ties between my mom and I are strained and tightened 
 Even more than they were before all of this shit 
 Been back a week and I already feel like calling it quits 
 Something sinister to it 
 A pendulum swinging slow 
 A degenerate moving 
 Through the city with criminal stealth 
 Welcome to enemy turf 
 Harder than immigrants work 
 "Golf" is stitched into my shirt 
 Get up off the pavement 
 Brush the dirt up off my psyche 
 Psyche, psyche 
 (Can I get that, oh) 
 (Let me get that beat in my headphones)
