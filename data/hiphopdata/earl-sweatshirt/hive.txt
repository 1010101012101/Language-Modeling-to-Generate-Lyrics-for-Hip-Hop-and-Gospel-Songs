Promise Heron I'll put my fist up 
 After I get my dick sucked 
 Quick buck, maybe a gold chain 
 With that fucking flow that s-s-so belittles 
 Men, they tentatively tend to turn and go when I am finished 
 Stone cold, hardly fucking with these niggas, nigga listen 
 The description doesn't fit, if not a synonym of menace 
 Then forget it, in turn these critics and interns 
 Admitting the shit spitted, just burn like six furnaces 
 Rent, it'll fix learning them digits and simultaneously 
 Dispelling "one-trick-pony" myths, isn't he? 
 One adolescent, fucking six nigga energy 
 Crawling down 'Fax like a rich nigga centipede 
 Crack ceramic and slap a hand out of cash account 
 Stamp and shouting, thrashing, these niggas done let the Kraken out 
 Crack-a-lackin, like snap, crackle, poppin' your ammo or 
 Hide your face, and throw your flannels off, Sweatshirt, nigga 
 '87 roof top rising 
 Whipping hoopties, tryna boost raw chronic 
 (Brutus in that booth, double scoop, hock vomit up) 
 (Sub rocking thud knocking niggas teeth loose) 
 Bruh, I don't fuck with no cops (Rolling with that flow swamp) 
 Catch me over stove top (Rapping to that coke rock) 
 (Passionless in old Jive clothing with them doors wide open) 
 (Dim the floor lights focused) Like it's nothing, 'cause it's nothing, bitch 
 From that city that's recession-hit, where stressed 
 Niggas could flex metal with pedal to rake pennies in 
 Desolate testaments trying to stay Jekyll-ish 
 But most niggas Hyde and Brenda just stay pregnant 
 Breaking news that's less important when the Lakers lose 
 It's lead in that baby food, hands try to make it through 
 Fish-netted legs for them eyes that she cater to 
 Ride dirty as the fucking sky that you praying to 
 So here I sit, eye in the pyramid 
 God spit it like it's truth serum in that beer and then 
 (Poof) Disappear again, reappear bearded on 
 Top of a lear steering it into the kid's ear again 
 Provider of the backdrop music 
 For the crack rock user and the mascot, Earl 
 Rawer than the skin, knee cap on that black top 
 Salivary glands lighter fluid for the matchbox 
 Striking, wait, who the fuck you badder than? 
 Boy oh boy, I'm bad as burnt pollo off the grill and shit 
 Spitter of the little nick, nimble rick rolling bitch 
 Niggas pick litter, piff-blower, plus I pillage shit 
 '87 roof top rising 
 Whipping hoopties, tryna boost raw chronic 
 (Brutus in that booth, double scoop, hock vomit up) 
 (Sub rocking thud knocking niggas teeth loose) 
 Bruh, I don't fuck with no cops (Rolling with that flow swamp) 
 Catch me over stove top (Rapping to that coke rock) 
 (Passionless in old Jive clothing with them doors wide open) 
 (Dim the floor lights focused) Like it's nothing, 'cause it's nothing, bitch 
 Quit with all that tough talk, bruh, we know you niggas ain't about shit 
 Come around, we gun 'em down, bodies piled, Auschwitz 
 Bulletproof outfits, weapons concealed 
 I'm ready to kill, so test it, all my weapons is real 
 Selling thizz, couldn't tell him what the recipe is 
 Got 'em wishing that they never gave these weapons to kids, cheers 
 Send chills up spines of fat bitches after 
 Shows throwing out sandwiches, niggas get it how they 
 Live and I live for money, other words, I'm getting money 
 Little boy taught me when it's time to ride, they'll send him for me 
 Ain't nobody scaring me, niggas ain't prepared for heat 
 Tools hit like pool sticks, the way I cue shit 
 If this was '88, I would have signed to Ruthless 
 '94 would have had them walking down Death Row 
 First is when the best go, hate is what the rest do 
 Voice inside my head told me wet 'em if they test you 
 So it's raging water season 
 That yomper big as Larry Johnson, leave your momma seedless 
 Everybody hard until it's only God they seeing 
 Kittens soft but in they songs be trapping hard as Jeezy, I don't believe it 
 But to each his own, I ain't tripping long as I can reach the chrome 
 Heat your home like Southern California Gas, police pass 
 Tell 'em free Smalls, off Palm with the heat drawn 
 Strapped up long as the chief for police armed 
 Raised where the beasts are, north of the Beach 
 A couple streets past Baby Jay, bony niggas spraying Ks 
 Ruger with the pork face, Jewish for the court case 
 Here to save you niggas from the sorbet, Coldchain 
 Like it's nothing 'cause it's nothing, bitch
