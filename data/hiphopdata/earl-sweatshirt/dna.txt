Intercepting a fifth of whisky 
 And necking it till I'm dizzy 
 I never was defenseless 
 I never hugged the fence 
 I pick a side and trust in it 
 Stomach full of drugs and shit 
 My niggas on some other 
 Cleanse Sunday, binge Monday 
 Then another six days 
 Back to Sunday when it's done again (shit) 
 And the pants better be creased on my corpse 
 If you need that, run until the street lights off 
 Back got bigger, got the team strapped on 
 And you thought it was magic 
 But that's just the difference 
 Nigga my team is magicians 
 We think of the shit that we want then we get it 
 Look I got hoes in my britches 
 Big Up Dill and Britches 
 Full part coming soon 
 Thought you knew this my nigga 
 It's crackin' like French tips 
 Just checkin' and balancing 
 And checks and salaries 
 Testing my friendships 
 Cause niggas get sour of this 
 Rap shit got the best of me 
 I threw the rest off the balcony 
 Shoutout Da$h and Retchy 
 I know yo bitch check for me 
 So much for chivalry 
 So long to every bitch tryna get intimate 
 I'm in my 20s now 
 Feet aimed at the jaws of the running mouth 
 Disdain for the law since a fucking child 
 Spotlights on me I ain't stopping in my tracks 
 We taking it all and we running out 
 Threw shade in the past but you want me now ho 
 Put your face in your palm when I come around ya 
 Tell momma get a gun if I get too popular 
 I'm just being honest with it 
 Tell her stop whining, it ain't no mo problems 
 I'm the best out of all these niggas 
 Watch your tone when you speaking 
 Ain't no home for the weak and 
 No rest for your ass if I know that you're sleeping 
 I'm here and I'm there 
 And I'm up and I'm down 
 And I'm low and I'm peakin 
 It's cold in the deep end 
 Bitch nigga, we the train 
 If you see 'em wave 
 Ain't no bitch in my DNA 
 Bitch nigga, we the train 
 If you see 'em wave 
 Ain't no bitch in my DNA 
 Hundred blunts, niggas chains, that's my day to day 
 Niggas tryna ride my train like they fucking strays 
 My bro left today, fuck 
 Hot sauce in my cup of noodles, you taught me that 
 I ain't seen us in years 
 And this news right here almost made me have a heart attack 
 Your momma heart intact 
 We just spoke, I couldn't stomach that 
 I'm going to London on the first, I'm bringing you something back 
 A house on the hill with a big ass grill 
 Where we could have a boxing match 
 Japan, Australia, I know you be proud of that 
 I got a couple bitches now, I ain't gotta lie about that 
 I know you in a better place, I can't even cry about that 
 When I look into the clouds, I know you look down on me 
 Right next to grandmammy 
 And the rest of the ones who wanna see me happy
