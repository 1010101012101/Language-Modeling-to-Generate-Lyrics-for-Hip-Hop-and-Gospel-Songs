(Intro: RZA) 
 Search inside my purse to buy something worthless 
 99 problems all gone in that one joint 
 And the neck gold froze like he held it at gunpoint 
 I'mma bubble in the belly of the monster 
 With a duffle full of troubles, trunk rattle in the Mazda 
 Ragged with the Contra, Phantom of the Opera 
 And I'm standing on the cop's truck, stacking for the long run 
 The bags packed, roadside with the thumb out 
 Toe tagged, don't gag, [fag], spit your gum out 
 Nomadic, chrome-grabbing when it's danger 
 I'm a manger born puppy holding flight like a hangar do 
 Knife to the trachea spit, scabies and bet 
 The label don't like me but they pay me a grip 
 And you see how his day going by the state of his wrists 
 My niggas busy play doughing, bet the baker came swinging like 
 What the fuck you saying? All that aiming and miss 
 I'mma fuck the freckles off your bitch, nigga 
 (Hook: RZA) 
 I'll fuck the freckles off your face, bitch 
 We could do this shit all night 
 I'll fuck the freckles off your face, bitch 
 You know me, drugs out, 'front the telly 
 I'm couch-drunk and ready to fuck, count fetti and bucks 
 Pack loud as that slap 'cross the belly 
 What's up? Fuck nigga, what's up? 
 I'm at the deli scheming on a Fanta and a Camel Crush 
 Screaming "Saddle up!" like fuck is beef? Get your cattle cut, pansy 
 If them fans only local, why them flights trans-atlantied up? 
 The rice and patty's cooked, nice for the chancellor 
 Them teeth with the gold bright, the light switches mad at us 
 Snap chatting panty clad baddies, I'm a bachelor 
 I'm high and polite cause po-lice is in back of us 
 And write with the same hand I smack 'em up with 
 Stretching out the fifteen I had initially 
 Icky Thump, sticky kush lit up in a rental Jeep
