Cause I've been up and I've been down 
 And if it's one thing that I've found 
 You gotta keep pushing baby 
 I swear it feels like we almost made it 
 We on the way up yeah, don't look down 
 'Cause we so high off the ground 
 But you gotta push baby, to the top yeah, we almost made it 
 I relate more to struggle than to corpse and the bubbles 
 Your pain never champagne when you always in trouble 
 I'm at the dealership but I'm selling these cars 
 It's a result of collecting my second felony charge 
 Watching fellows get lost, spitting bullshit bars 
 It's like a mirage, niggas only write for the broads 
 As far as I could recall, there was only one tar 
 One DJ, one king, one god, it seem all 
 Rookies they don't respect us boy 
 Like they totally forgot came second thought 
 They don't seem to reflect no more 
 That's why they coming out sounding so similar 
 It's quite confusing for you to limit the 
 Originator, boy do I hate em, fuck a perpetrator 
 Hater record label slave trader 
 My story the recipe of a grown man 
 Had to go put my destiny in my own hands 
 'Cause I've been up and I've been down 
 And if it's one thing that I've found 
 You gotta keep pushing baby 
 I swear it feels like we almost made it 
 We on the way up yeah, don't look down 
 'Cause we so high off the ground 
 But you gotta push baby, to the top yeah, we almost made it 
 I ain't emerge to tell you how I splurge on the birds 
 I don't give them nothing but word 
 And still hit the curve then swerve, to another nerve 
 Murders are perb, they heard the giddy like they heard in the word 
 33 in the third, what I spit is verbally is absurd 
 Never 33 in the third, it's addictive, it's urb, you heard 
 Come try fuck a nigga, I run you over, hit your head with the bumper sticker 
 It's gonna take a month to fix you 
 I'm being sincere, when I say that you be in intensive care 
 I don't think you really wanna visit there 
 Flow water, words flow like a motor boat 
 Been there and done it dony, I know the road 
 Front on me I go for broke, smoke with me it's toe for toe 
 Joke with me in front of his cabin I'll make an open joke 
 Oops I told joke twice, but that's all right 
 You motherfuckers know that I'm ... 
 'Cause I've been up and I've been down 
 And if it's one thing that I've found 
 You gotta keep pushing baby 
 I swear it feels like we almost made it 
 We on the way up yeah, don't look down 
 'Cause we so high off the ground 
 But you gotta push baby, to the top yeah, we almost made it
