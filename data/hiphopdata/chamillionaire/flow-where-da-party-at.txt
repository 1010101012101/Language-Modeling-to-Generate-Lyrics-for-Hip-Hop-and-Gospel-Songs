Hey we some ballas that 
 Got candy paint and screens twankies all of that 
 Automatic start when I start tha Lac 
 I'mma open up my trunk and let tha lights glow 
 I'm sittin' low 
 I'm gettin' doe 
 If you got a problem with that let me know (or Paul Wall tha chick magnet slip in through tha back door) 
 Chamillionaire: 
 Draws come down when king Koopa tha boss come round 
 Call lost and found 'cause when your girl was lost you found 
 Her taken off her gown for far from town 
 Stop whisperin talk up when you talkin' down 
 Approach me nice if not don't approach me twice 
 'Cause I will choke tha life out your vocal pipes 
 Especially if tha works you speakin' at spoken right 
 My ice's crushed so don't touch tha broken ice 
 Koopa got all this publishin often covered in 
 Ice broads be lovin' him his car be hoverin 
 Broads be buggin him but that boy be thuggenin 
 Be in more damn dirt than a car for shovellin 
 That boy been smugglin rims out of tha state 
 Out of tha country that got him riding chrome in Qqwait 
 And don't get me started on Summolia I'm out ballin ya 
 I can make you turn your head without callin ya 
 Twanks crawlin uh let it be known I'm thrown 
 I'm throwed tha Swisha House home thrown I own 
 On tha phone freaky moan at tha sound of tha tone 
 I come alone after I five her a then she gone 
 In this game I'm here forever you can't get rid of me 
 2 percent hate tha other 98 feelin' me 
 Chamillionaire's voice screwed all of these boys feelin' me 
 Cups leanin like tha tower of Pizza in Italy 
 Paul Wall: 
 I'mma walkin' blind spot because I'm hard to spot 
 Candy blueberry on tha drop leavin' stains and spots 
 People ask like N'sync was tha deal with this pop 
 My trunk pop like like firecrackers pop pop pop 
 Oh... melesta your breasta 
 More ice than tha frozen food section at Fiesta 
 Tha Chick Magnet I got more mack than a big Mac 
 I'm paid in full like Madd Hatta and Big Kat 
 I got more mac N cheese than macicroni and cheese 
 You're comin' home with me tonight girl give our homie tha keys 
 U got a man and, that ain't really important 
 He's a jerk sweep tha dity flirt with tha skirt sargent 
 I run so much game Nike wants an endoursement 
 My trunk got more lights than a low fat asortment 
 Beg your pardon Ozarka water wash tha ride 
 Candy paint lookin' so clean look like I washed it with tide 
 Eh Sir Daily drinkin' congiac 
 Janet Jackson mad 'cause I never called her back 
 I'm babilous Paul Wall and I'm throwed as a javilin 
 Chamillion sing tha hook babbilous boys babbilin
