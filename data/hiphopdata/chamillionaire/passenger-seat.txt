 As I slide through on foes you know that the baddest women wanna get chose 
 I got 'em talkin' bout swing down sweet chariot let me ride 
 Hop into my passenger side. 
 As I slide through on foes you know that the baddest women wanna get chose 
 Talking about swing down so gone let me show you 
 How we do it on that south side 
 (Verse 1 Chamillionaire) 
 Let's give a toast to all these losers that cuff broads 
 Without Charlie there wouldn't even be none of us dog 
 I'm always fresh ain't ever nothing to dust off 
 So much good game in my brain, they're thinking this must cost 
 Don't trust talk you silly rabbit, thought that I would give her carrots and cabbage but no I haven't 
 Chasing the same chicks like there ain't no mo on the planet, 
 Act like you wasn't with it like Justin after that Janet... incident 
 I'm convinced that there's plenty of little sensitive rappers really actors, 
 Numbers is probably infinite 
 Thought that I shouldn't mention it after gettin' all intimate 
 You hear I'm talking in person like It's a pimpin' skit 
 They're serenading in this rap game G, they package it and calling it a pimpin' 
 What this crap ain't free? 
 You're chasing groupies buying 'em gucci haha that can't be 
 I'm living just like Tom and Jerry 'cause the cat chase me 
 As I slide through on foes you know that the baddest women wanna get chose 
 I got 'em talkin' bout swing down sweet chariot let me ride 
 Hop into my passenger side. 
 As I slide through on foes you know that the baddest women wanna get chose

 (Verse 2 Short Dawg) 
 Shawty wanna ride ride with me, young buck 
 She see me coming down swanging like nun chuks 
 Them Texas plates will make a sexy face bum rush 
 Stacks on deck pockets lookin' like Sun Trust 
 I chunks up the south side when I pass 
 84 glass cops out they harass 
 (With My) Mug on mean glocks off in the stash 
 (And the) slab so clean, tops off and all that jazz 
 And I'm getting to the money, 50s, 20s, 100s 
 Don't worry about how nigga just know just know that it's coming 
 These rappers getting punished 'cause I spit fire on the road to the riches passin by you hitch hikers 
 Tell my niggas when I make then we can all ball 
 So I'm gonna grind till my money tall as Paul Gasol 
 I'm respected like a rabi 
 Young but I'm mad fly 
 Plus I got 'em starring like a glass eye, as I...

 (Verse 3 Chamillionaire) 
 I'm yelling hey miss Parker we both should take a ride in my Charger 
 I hope that you won't pass up this offer girl 
 'Cause you know I drop you back off tomorrow. 
 I'm yelling hey miss Parker just walk up to my car when I call ya 
 I got to let you know that you're gorgeous girl 
 And you know that I wanna really know you. 
 So I'm yelling hey, hey 
 You're frontin like I ain't the biggest business 
 (You) better do more than dishes, (You) better have more than just Pennies 
 I've been a rebel I told you these corporate losers can't deal with me 
 Get old, We're gonna live like the Beverely Trillbillies 
 The real deally careful when seatin 'em cause now a days their shirt and their back be filled with helium 
 Wont deduct no points if your shirt is a extra medium 
 But if you super sizing the truth, then I'm probably eatin in 
 The dash is digital, the diamonds are individuals 
 What I'm here to do is to give your woman a physical 
 I'm the one who she givin' it to, This point in her life is pivotal 
 Could be the last time the that she ever see an invisible 
 Poof! Haha, I'm such a dog 
 As I slide through on foes you know that the baddest women wanna get chose 
 I got 'em talkin' bout swing down sweet chariot let me ride 
 Hop into my passenger side. 
 As I slide through on foes you know that the baddest women wanna get chose 
 Talking about swing down and ride with me, In My Passenger Seat
