In this game it seems that I'm lyrically reaching a point where it's not fair no more 
 Hit 'em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy 
 It's like I'm bringing war to your front door

 Hit 'em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy 
 It's like I'm bringing war to your front door, front door 
 ... I can get a hooker shot like urban 
 You never bust repping just like you a virgin 
 Under your girl done hitting a belly like a surgeon 
 A hundred milli gotta get it brrr Birdman 
 Christina Milian she ain't got her man 
 And I don't have no dreams either, I'm working 
 Surfing the earth and tryna stay urban 
 You see the heater poking out I got the shirt in 
 All of these rappers getting jerked without the jurgens 
 The similes and metaphors that I be serving gone right over their head, hot turbans 
 I got a... and she a Persian 
 Ain't got a deal with Eminem but I am burning 
 Hot, got a lawyer he's really a diversion 
 I'm riding dirtier than 30 days with no detergent 
 Ain't really with the beef but the tweets I get at you 
 If I ever see you in the streets I'ma slap you 
 I don't mean LeBron when the Heat coming at you 
 ... Like young... tattoo 
 All this cake getting flipped like a spatula 
 Not a act like a chat I'm a natural 
 Suits tried to take me out the game what did that do 
 Still here like the name of an ear statue 
 Bread cheese here funds really high 
 Work in the strip club and throw my lunch in the sky 
 Front till you die while I spend a month in Dubai 
 I'm a guard in the streets alhamdulillah 
 Test and I bet that you gon' flunk when you try 
 I don't even gotta use my gun to reply 
 You get punched in the eye, punched in the eye 
 ... Blood finna fly

 See the... shoot in the tank I'm in the cockpit 
 Bullets that'll jump on your head like it's a moshpit 
 Even if you're wearing a bulletproof outfit 
 I got a Batman you... Robin like a sidekick 
 The rap game really my chick 
 Topic is whether Chamillionaire is the topic 
 Put 'em on the line I'm telling you that I got this 
 Autograph the weapon I'm hitting you with a shot whip 
 ... Million dollar bow tie still be a clown it's equivalent to cho chi 
 Go and die know why he will tell the most lies most likely to get hit with the... 
 Yo price pow hit 'em with the scorcher what you know about the Chinese, water torture 
 Can't run from the lyricism cause it caught ya 
 Write it when I'm in your nightmare like an author 
 West craving the world what I'm saving 
 I got a halla tip that I brought for the occasion 
 I put it in a weapon that was made by an Asian 
 My mind is a maze and that means that I'm amazing 
 Your girl call me papi coming with a posse 
 Everybody black I'm the opposite of nazi 
 In the major label they be thinking I'm Gaddafi 
 I'm taking out anyone who think a nigga stop me
