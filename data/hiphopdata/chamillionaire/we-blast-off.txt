Chamillionaire 
 Koopa 
 See niggaz be hatin' me and makin' ma pressure rise 
 Dey act like dat metal inside, the metal will never fly 
 Snitches ain't real 'cause dey lie so come wid a better lie 
 We da truth of da future den tell 'em rap game prepare to die I 
 Got dat reelin in for ya, 
 Check da wheels on da roda, dat ain't enough 
 Den ya know ya didn't check da grill and da motor, 
 Grip da wheel and control her 
 Watch da bills like a roda 
 Dats a Clinton Supporter 
 Get plenty bills I can show ya 
 Better dan I can tell ya 
 Chase da chedda I get her 
 I be chasin dat chedda don't have a chedda vandetta 
 Quick, switchin and dividin on me 
 Ask any nigga in da sockland on me 
 Drama, never been a problem homie 
 Ain't really dat hard to spot phoney 
 Sixty-five percent of these rappers who tell you dey stackin 
 Eighty-five percent of dem rappers who tell you dat actin' 
 Slap your captain what happen 
 Had'da bring 'em to business 
 Mention me in the senates 
 Get yo ass beat for yo fitted
