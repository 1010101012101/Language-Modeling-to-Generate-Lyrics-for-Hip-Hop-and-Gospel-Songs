The Rain Is Fallin' And The Weather Is Cold 
 Don't Know Which Way To Go, But I Continue To Roll 
 The Rainfall Is Really Taking A Toll 
 On My Mind And My Body And On My Spirit And Soul 
 The Rain's Fallin' But I'm Keeping A Hold 
 On The Light 'Cause I Know That I Could Spin Outta Control 
 I Know Know, I Know Know, I Know This Is Gonna Be One Rocky Road 
 What part of the voyage is this? 
 Friendship and business don't mix 
 Wit anyone else its just business 
 Wit friends I'm personally pissed 
 Is this a curse or a gift? 
 Guess I was blessed wit my wish 
 Don't tell me that you feel my pain 
 That I sayin' its best if we switch 
 You take the fortune and fame 
 And see if it's what you expected 
 Take the money and change 
 And be careful where you invest it 
 Just take the test and don't stress it 
 You get stopped by a detective 
 Tryna get in ya personal life 
 The gotta do yo best to protect it 
 The answer rests in a message 
 When I go I'll go in a blaze 
 But it won't be no captain savin' 
 'Cause where I'm goin' ya saved 
 Tryna rain down on my parade 
 Till that umbrella get raised 
 They thinkin' that they can read me 
 Then they ain't knowin' my page 
 Tryin' to keep a smile on my face 
 Even at times when I engage 
 In business conversations 
 Wit people I know are snakes 
 If life is a piece of cake 
 Part of the icing is venom 
 Spent a lifetime tryin' to bring me down 
 But I jus ain't gonna let em 
 Ya betta tell em 
 The Rain Is Fallin' And The Weather Is Cold 
 Don't Know Which Way To Go, But I Continue To Roll 
 The Rainfall Is Really Taking A Toll 
 On My Mind And My Body And On My Spirit And Soul 
 The Rain's Fallin' But I'm Keeping A Hold 
 On The Light 'Cause I Know That I Could Spin Outta Control 
 I Know Know, I Know Know, I Know This Is Gonna Be One Rocky Road 
 I'm back and forth and I'm pacing 
 Bein more patient than patience 
 Tryin' to wait for the good news to show up 
 But I'm unfortunately waitin' 
 Gotta be group participation 
 If its intercourse that we making 
 I was unfortunately done 
 And she was unfortunately fakin' 
 'Cause the only sexual spark 
 Is the spark he got for the dough 
 They say till death do us part 
 But that part is where she says no 
 There are too many emotions 
 Emotions like pins and needles 
 Actin' like emotions are evil 
 Like showin love is illegal 
 I thought that it was a eagle 
 But I've seen this vulture before 
 He thinks this is where I stop 
 'Cause he sees that I'm walkin' slow 
 But no I think you should know 
 That soon as I get where I go 
 You'll remember the fact that 
 I had a purpose fa'sho 
 I Hope You Know Where Your Going 
 I hope You Know That Today 
 On The Side Of The Road 
 You Gon See A Whole Lotta Snakes 
 When The Bad Weather Comes 
 To Rain Down On Ya Parade 
 Jus Raise Up Ya Umbrella 
 And Try To Keep Goin' Straight 
 The Rain Is Fallin' And The Weather Is Cold 
 Don't Know Which Way To Go, But I Continue To Roll 
 The Rainfall Is Really Taking A Toll 
 On My Mind And My Body And On My Spirit And Soul 
 The Rain's Fallin' But I'm Keeping A Hold 
 On The Light 'Cause I Know That I Could Spin Outta Control 
 I Know Know, I Know Know, I Know This Is Gonna Be One Rocky Road 
 (Verse 3 - Devin Da Dude) 
 This road has many curves 
 Many bumps and potholes 
 It can even take you through a loop if you ain't got yo 
 Shit togetha unpredictable weather could leave ya 
 Dehydrated frostbitten washed away or eitha 
 Ran ova by heavy traffic watch where you roam 
 'Cause it's a challenge jus tryna make it home 
 But still I walk I keep my pace I keep my stride 
 Would hitchhike, but there's too much pride 
 I must find a narrow path 
 So I can walk and laugh out loud 
 Cry and sing without bein judged by the crowd 
 Maybe someday I could just fly away but for now 
 I'll jus beat my feet and get there someway somehow 
 And mile after mile after mile I'll smile 
 Keepin' my head up even though rain's pourin down 
 And the road gets rough and the journey is long 
 I might get tired but I must move on 
 The Rain Is Falling And The Weather Is Cold 
 Don't Know Which Way To Go, But I Continue To Roll 
 The Rainfall Is Really Taking A Toll 
 On My Mind And My Body And On My Spirit And Soul 
 The Rain's Fallin' But I'm Keeping A Hold 
 On The Light 'Cause I Know That I Could Spin Outta Control 
 I Know Know, I Know Know, I Know This Is Gonna Be One Rocky Road
