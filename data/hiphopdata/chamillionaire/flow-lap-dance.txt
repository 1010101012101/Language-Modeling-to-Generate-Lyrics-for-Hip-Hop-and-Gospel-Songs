Hold ass, Hoes ask for a lap dance 
 I'm tossin mo trash than a trashman wit a trashcan 
 Lew Hawk just started a business on Gulf Bank with that man 
 Delivers mo bricks than a freethrow from shaq's hand 
 Chamillionaire knows guys, and Hollywood Clique make dough rise 
 When spinnin' on wheels of fortune, the chopper is yo prize 
 If you tryna compliment elbows and the way the spokes ride 
 You can see clear, I got glasses like a man with four eyes 
 Wise like four wise guys, that's nice, but what else? 
 Screens fall like the pants on the man jumping with no belt 
 Screens fall like a crippled man tryna get up wit no help 
 If you was me, you would Ooh!, be impressin' yo-self 
 Hoes melt like an ice cream sundae, when I'm posted up on Sunday 
 On MLK in a Hundai, I could still live with ya honey 
 If she yellow as the cheddar on some macaroni 
 Betta ask yo homie, I'll take her whether you strapped or phony 
 At the Shoney's, in in the pool with ya darlin' 
 Me, Paul and Hawk ballin', Spider Man chrome crawlin' 
 Come through ya TV screens fallin' showin green like a garden 
 No buffet at olive garden, beg my damn pardon 
 Them boys in Orleans be throwin' fights and riots 
 Let's have a moment of silence while they show you some violence 
 I know boys with dirt work, like a washing appliance 
 If you see a triple beam, then it isn't... **Scratches Out**
