(Intro - Chamillionaire) 
 Yeah, hold up, uh, Playlist Poison 
 I mean, is everybody winning, really? 
 Say what you feel and mean what you mean 
 (Chorus 1 - Rock D) 
 Aye, aye, coldest swag that y'all done seen, keep two bad chicks on my team 
 Usually known for riding dirty, but I'm always riding clean 
 Roll me in a pile of green, cut my check, then kiss my ring 
 All-all-all I do is win, man I'm on my Charlie Sheen 
 (Verse 1 - Chamillionaire) 
 Man all these boys my little sons, I know I left y'all in poor care 
 They said I was on my high horse, but I guess that meant my Porsche chair 
 Checking into that top floor, how come we don't ever see y'all there? 
 Y'all ain't checking in nowhere, y'all stay logged on the poor square 
 Poor squares, I don't know where you got your pimp degree 
 I might be messing with her friend but I'll man up to it admittedly 
 You take these girls out to eat and they leave from you and visit me 
 Pimping is something that I learned but don't use much like calligraphy 
 I'm visibly, the man, I heard you talking about it, and winning is what you say it is 
 But you ain't really winning homie, you really just good at saying it 
 And you ain't swimming in women homie, these women be calling you desert dick 
 As soon as they pull that winning on me, I'ma give them this verse then tell them quit 
 I never trick, last time I checked, and check my checks, I was getting plenty 
 Most people that got opinions, just talk because they ain't getting any 
 If you ain't lived it, then just forget it, because it really ain't nothing that you could tell me 
 Your voice ain't even worth a penny and your convo ain't worth a meal at Denny's 
 (Chorus 2 - Rock D - w/ Chamillionaire in the background) 
 Aye, aye, coldest swag that y'all done seen, keep two bad chicks on my team 
 Usually known for riding dirty, but I'm always riding clean 
 Roll me in a pile of green, cut my check, then kiss my ring 
 All-all-all I do is win, man I'm on my Charlie Sheen 
 Charlie Sheen, Ch-Ch-Ch-Charlie Sheen 
 I ain't got no damn boss, man I'm on my Charlie Sheen 
 All-all-all I do is win, let me tell you what I mean 
 Cut the check, and kiss the ring, make some way for Charlie Sheen 
 (Verse 2 - Killer Mike) 
 Say I'm on that Carlos Estevez, I'm winning hoe 
 I'm swimming in women that love women, so I'm bi-winning hoe 
 Before you put your judgment on pimping and say he sinning 
 Try waking up on Egyptian linen with Egyptian women 
 I'm talking the hottest goddesses, wake me up with massages 
 Some say I'm a narcissist, other say I'm misogynist 
 I, say I'm a rockstar, let's take flight in my rocket ship 
 Young Casanova, passing over, you Simpson haters 
 And you never been about real bread, you ain't a baker 
 And you don't get rich to have one bitch, I ain't a Quaker 
 I remain unbought, unbossed, a young Jose-a 
 I'm Sheenin like my daddy before me, because I'm his son 
 I could make these execs pay what they weigh, I'm talking tons 
 Then I take that bank to Vegas and blow it, I'm having fun 
 So, why would I act like a peasant, when I'm a king? 
 They ask me what's this drug I'm doing? That Charlie Sheen 
 (Chorus 2 - w/ Chamillionaire in the background) 
 (Bridge - Chamillionaire) 
 Because I'm the man, yeah I said I'm the man 
 You might not like who I am but you know I don't give a damn 
 (I don't give a damn) 
 Because I'm the man, yeah I said I'm the man 
 Trying to put me in a jam, but you know you my biggest fan 
 (You my biggest fan) 
 I'm the man, yeah I said I'm the man 
 Know I'm about my business, so just trust me and stick to the plan 
 (Come on) 
 They don't even understand, how we be popping rubber bands 
 (Ha-ha, winning) 
 (Verse 3 - Chamillionaire) 
 They say that it ain't no "I" in team, I told them it ain't no "I" in Sheen 
 And I see way too many eyes, watching my nuts, stop trying to swing 
 Illest drug that y'all done seen, hoe I'm clean as Irish Springs 
 They tell me they want that "Tiger Blood" 
 Then I'm a bottle it up and supply the fiends 
 She say she a goddess, she going to be my side chick 
 Right after she slide it open, I'm poking like a Sidekick 
 Heard my former A&R trying to give me words to rhyme with 
 I told him choke on these nuts and I don't know the Heimlich 
 (Chorus 2 - w/ Chamillionaire in the background)
