Yeah 
 Life goes on 
 They told me to make another song for the radio (radio) 
 My mind keep telling me yes 
 But my heart keep telling me no (no) 
 And all I can really think about is the fact that you're gone (fact that you're gone) 
 So now it looks like I got another sad song 
 Life goes on (goes on) 
 Life goes on 
 Life goes on baby 
 Life goes on 
 Yeah 
 They was watching my pocket 
 While I was popin my tags 
 Staying friends with my friends has been the imposible task 
 If I had a dollar for every friend I thought that would last 
 I'd hit my head on the ceiling standing on top of my cash 
 You just trying to be playa 
 They just trying to play you 
 Soon as you get in some trouble 
 Well see whos trying to save you 
 Promise you that the day hit me with betrayal 
 I'mma smell your cologne I'll be so close on your tail 
 And the homie you really thought was real is the snitch 
 I'm the person you call when you tryna get out a ditch 
 Yeah I'm talking to you 
 Wear the shoe if it fits 
 The broke people that know you gon say you changed when you rich 
 I'm on the screne shining so get with the program 
 Moneys the team baby and I am the spokesman 
 The trophy is more grands 
 I hold it with both hand 
 I shook of the haters after I told them 
 Haha 
 I used to be such a player 
 Till I hoped out of the game 
 Plenty knowledge and dollars 
 Went to college with fame 
 Used to look your relationships like a positive thing 
 Till I turned into a bank account 
 To deposit your bling 
 Used to be such a player 
 But now I'm only a ref 
 So when I tell you you fouled 
 Well you can only accept 
 Still hungry as ever 
 Somebody show me a chef 
 Apitiet for the money 
 So stick a fork in the rest 
 Unless you callin my mother 
 I know she love me the best 
 Still in love with my money 
 Cause money love to death 
 Used to promis my lady we'd have the lovliest sex 
 Was in love withe the honeys 
 But they just loved me then left 
 All the groupies that's callin me thought I didn't exist 
 Yeah I'm talking to you 
 Wear the shoe if it fits 
 She put death on her lips 
 Tryed to give me a kiss 
 But I turned my head away so shed miss now 
 Yeah 
 'Cause I ain't speaking through music to try to get you to dance 
 Tryna get you to just see the bigger picture at glance 
 Record lable get mad 
 You can keep the advance 
 You can blame it on me 
 Say it was me when they ask 
 Yeah it came with a mic 
 They had came with a knife 
 Yeah he died on the spot 
 But after saving his wife 
 See the pain that I write 
 It ain't a thing or a sight 
 Ain't a thing cause really I'm just explaining my life 
 I could tell you to smile but it would sound kinda sad 
 I could talk about music but it would sound like I'm mad 
 Cause the first thing I thought of bout when my pen hit the pad 
 Before I finish this song another partner passed 
 Yes it does 
 Life goes on and on and on 
 And on 
 Onn 
 Onnnn 
 Life goes on 
 Yeah 
 Yes it does
