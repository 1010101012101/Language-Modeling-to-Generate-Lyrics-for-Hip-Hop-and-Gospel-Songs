(Chamillionaire chorus) 
 Rap game I used to love you (used to love ya baby) 
 But now I don't love you the same (love you the same) 
 Baby I'm still thinking of you but no it's not you it's the change 
 But still I'm ridin' like you my wife 
 And you will always be in my life, but you ain't right 
 I used to love you but sumthin 'bout you ain't the same (it ain't the same) 
 (Chamillionaire verse) 
 I ain't talk to you for a week but that's how it supposed to be 
 I swear to you no one out there loves yo ass more than me 
 Cause you wasn't not holdin' me the rap game promoted me 
 Wasnt greedy with the attention you made sure they noticed me 
 And that day that big watts told me he was cuttin' the members 
 Yeah, I remember the moment clear like the nigga was standin here 
 But no I didn't interfere but my nigga I didn't cheer 
 Say it wasn't a good idea cause that coulda been our year 
 There is not an us anymore its everyone for me 
 I ain't trippin' ima lead the people if that's what it's gonna be 
 If that's what it's gonna be, realest nigga I know is me 
 Ben franklin was runnin' to slow needent just let it flee 
 You can ask a nigga 'bout me they'll say that I'm in the zone 
 When the duo thing didn't do hot, shit I stood on my own 
 I was bein the bigger man while they shootin slugs in they songs 
 Now its obvious that the fans can realize who was wrong 
 Look in the eyes of a hata like how did you get your data 
 There's no such thing as a friend in this business 'cause you're the playa 
 They say you're in need of prayer I think that you need it playa 
 So this if all the haters, fake niggas and perpetrators 
 (Chamillionaire chorus) 
 Rap game I used to love you (used to love ya baby) 
 But now I don't love you the same (love you the same) 
 Baby I'm still thinking of you but no it's not you it's the change 
 But still I'm ridin' like you my wife 
 And you will always be in my life, but you ain't right 
 I used to love you but sumthin 'bout you ain't the same (it ain't the same) 
 Comin' up in the game jammin that ugk, ghetto boys ??? (but then it changed on me) 
 Now everyday another screw DJ tryin' to get in the game (it ain't the same homie) 
 What happened to the days of nwa snoop, cube and dre (the game done changed on me) 
 2pac a biggie are both are both passed away (I hope they ain't lonely) 
 (Chamillionaire verse two) 
 And its crazy cause you my baby but latley you got me deep 
 In the beef and the words that I right on the sheet are in the streets 
 You wait till they instigate then you gave me your voice to speak 
 Never gave me a choice I keep, my back on the wall for keeps 
 And the hatin' didn't ever cease but I took the real nigga route 
 Seen a hater and point him out and did more then ignore the mouth 
 Did more then sit in the house, did more then sit on the couch 
 That's what a real nigga bout and I bet all my real niggas vouch 
 Things come together but they split up eventually 
 Can't argue with destiny all this drama was met for me 
 It happened the way it happened didn't happen intentionally 
 I could hear 'em presentin me but they ain't even ??? me 
 The scripture was sent to me on a platta but it didn't matta 
 Vision already told me to distance myself from hata 
 Distance myself from cata but homie I hear the chatta 
 But I'm still married to the rap game and I won't let niggas have her 
 (Chamillionaire chorus)
