If you hate us you gone like us 
 If you like us you gone hate us 
 But one thing you can say is we some seroius paper chasers 
 Cause friends turn to haters 
 And some turn to traders 
 But my money never changes so "In Money We Trust" 
 (Cham verse) 
 White America stares at the pair of eyes and a colored face 
 Can they see why he love to chase 
 Green feddy in a gutta place 
 He grew up so he love the taste 
 Of dinero he's a disgrace 
 Denies that he's tellin' a lie 
 Lookin' right in his mothers face 
 Can't reside in his brother's face 
 Without ridin' on dubs he take 
 He hidin above his waste 
 And go ride on some other fake 
 Ass claimin that he's real but when he's not on that camera 
 He grabbin gifts up for these hoes like he's copyin santa 
 When he not on that camera he talkin' like Pac with his gramma 
 But he will not cock or pop the top of his hammer 
 Money's the reason why rich people get red dots on they flannel 
 Why bank tellers gotta get down on the floor like dave banner 
 Got a spot in that bama and also got a spot in that channel 
 Few of you know I got a spot to stack not in Atlanta 
 Don't trust the chick I'm with she fine and mixed with another race 
 But I keep the combination to my safe in a safe in another place 
 ('Cause I don't trust'em)
