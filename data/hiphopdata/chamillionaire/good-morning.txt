I wanna show all my haters love 
 This song's for you 
 If you acting like me and I was in your shoes 
 I'd probably hate on me, too 
 See when you gettin' big chash stacks 
 All the haters hate that 
 'Cuz they hate to see you to be successful 
 I wanna show all my haters love 
 So I'd wave to you like 
 Good Mornin' 
 Ha- ha- ha- ha- haters 
 Good Mornin' 
 Ha- ha- ha- ha- haters 
 Good Mornin' 
 Yeah today gonna be a good day, I'm feeling like I'm ice cube 
 I'm waking up like can't nobody mess up my mood 
 Knowin' I'm a boss, I'mma do what I choose 
 If I was you then I would probably hate on me, too 
 If it's true that money is time, then watch this 
 I ain't tryin' to run out, time so I purchased some watches 
 Y'all sick, the chips got da haters nauseous 
 They chicks jumpin' in my whip like a mosh pit 
 I wish I could be infected by any hate 
 But I can't 'cuz I just get infected by the bank 
 It's great to never know the feelin' of bein' fake 
 I awake, then I go take a visit to the sink 
 Ugh, dirty money got me sanitizing my hands 
 Lord knows what the previous owner did with these grands 
 Yeah, I ain't sayin' it just to brag 
 I say it so you can be motivated to gettin' cash 
 I wanna show all my haters love 
 This song's for you 
 If you acting like me and I was in your shoes 
 I'd probably hate on me, too 
 See when you gettin' big chash stacks 
 All the haters hate that 
 'Cuz they hate to see you to be successful 
 I wanna show all my haters love 
 So I'd wave to you like 
 Good Mornin' 
 Ha- ha- ha- ha- haters 
 Good Mornin' 
 Ha- ha- ha- ha- haters 
 Good Mornin' 
 Look, success is a woman that I always had dreams of sexen 
 If wanting her is a crime, then just take me in for possession 
 Even in a recession, I'm leavin' a good impression 
 Reflection on the rims, so they can see their expressions 
 I'm busy man, you need to schedule an appointment 
 Haters on they job, and they act like they enjoy it 
 Wake up in the mornin', and hop into my foreign 
 Walk into the bank, and just like a house warming 
 Hey, we get the money by the minute 
 They said we couldn't do it 
 But we already did it 
 I'm fresh outfitted, and my Benz got getted 
 'Cuz I get, get, get it and you did, did, didn't 
 And I admit it, I'm really 'bout to show you how I do 
 If you know your a hater, then this is dedicated to you 
 You hatin' my last move I'm way on my next move 
 See they hate to see you to be successful 
 I wanna show all my haters love 
 This song's for you 
 If you acting like me and I was in your shoes 
 I'd probably hate on me, too 
 See when you gettin' big chash stacks 
 All the haters hate that 
 'Cuz they hate to see you to be successful 
 I wanna show all my haters love 
 So I'd wave to you like 
 Good Mornin' 
 Ha- ha- ha- ha- haters 
 Good Mornin' 
 Ha- ha- ha- ha- haters 
 Good Mornin' 
 Ha- ha- ha- ha- haters 
 Good Mornin' 
 Ha- ha- ha- ha- haters 
 Good Mornin'
