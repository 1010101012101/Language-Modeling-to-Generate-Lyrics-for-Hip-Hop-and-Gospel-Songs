(Feat. Akon) 
 (Sirens) 
 Chamillionaire: 
 I'm looking in my rearview... 
 I can see a clearer view of you... (Konvict, Kon...) 
 (This is the remix!) I see you waiting, I know you hate it... 
 (Hook: Akon (Chamillionaire)) 
 I see them watching, they waiting, 
 For an oppurtunity to ride up on me, 
 Hopin' they don't roll up on me, 'cause today I'm ridin' dirty, 
 And if they stop me I might be going to jail tonight! 
 I see them watching, and waiting, 
 For an oppurtunity to ride up on me, 
 Hopin' they don't roll up on me, 'cause today I'm ridin' dirty, (Cheah!) 
 And if they stop me I might be going to jail tonight! (C'mon!) 
 (Verse 1: Chamillionaire) 
 I got twenty grand in my pocket and, I'm riding round with my pockets crammed, 
 You the one that got the contraband, you smokin' that like you in Amsterdam, 
 Before I know it, I see them sirens, I'm pullin' over, "Hey, we just ridin'!", 
 "Don't talk back, won't be no violence, just shut up and sit in your seat in silence", 
 Now the police is searching who, they searching me and then they searching you, 
 They smell the breeze and you smell like trees, 'cause you hit the blunt, and you hit the purple too, 
 Now the lie is irreversible, 'cause you just told them we was riding clean, 
 They question you but they ain't question me yet, I'm thinking the police ain't find a thing, 
 (Yup) Standing on the side of the freeway, wishing they would just hurry up, 
 And I can see him walkin' up to me like he about put me up in 'em cuffs, 
 I turn around and I look at you, and you turn away like you feelin' sick, 
 I'm going to jail for what I didn't commit, I must admit that I hate a snitch... 
 (Hook: Akon) 
 I see them watching, they waiting, 
 For an oppurtunity to ride up on me, 
 Hopin' they don't roll up on me, 'cause today I'm ridin' dirty, 
 And if they stop me I might be going to jail tonight! 
 I see them watching, and waiting, 
 For an oppurtunity to ride up on me, 
 Hopin' they don't roll up on me, 'cause today I'm ridin' dirty, 
 And if they stop me I might be going to jail tonight! 
 (Verse 2: Chamillionaire) 
 Ever since they heard the song 'Ridin' Dirty', the whole world been listening, I'm glad you heard me, 
 Some cops that representing the badge assure me, every cop ain't bad or tryna scare me, 
 A year later, after 'White 'n' Nerdy', on the grind, still tryin', still flyin' birdies, 
 That stuff in your cuff still drivin' swervy, ridin' dirty like a vehicle inside the Derby, 
 A little inspired by UGK, and the rest inspired by the life I'm living, 
 Seen that Impala, he was drunk and that's when I saw the red lights go get him, 
 And it's ironic that during the chase, he murdered Chase, and this kid was Christian, 
 Movin' target went across the street and unfortunately the car didn't miss him, 
 And now the family is soon to know, that they gone have to do another funeral, 
 The angels ain't singing to your tune no more, don't move too fast, baby, move it slow... 
 'Cause one day in here, baby... Next thing you know, 
 Next thing you know, everything you used to move don't move no mo'! 
 (Hook: Akon (Chamillionaire)) 
 I see them watching, they waiting, 
 For an oppurtunity to ride up on me, 
 Hopin' they don't roll up on me, 'cause today I'm ridin' dirty, 
 And if they stop me I might be going to jail tonight! 
 I see them watching, and waiting, 
 For an oppurtunity to ride up on me, (This is not a movie, it's real life!) 
 Hopin' they don't roll up on me, 'cause today I'm ridin' dirty, 
 And if they stop me I might be going to jail tonight! 
 Chamillionaire: 
 It's real life... It ain't just a song, it's a message... 
 Nobody ever opens their eyes till someone gets killed... 
 Rest In Peace to Sean Bell... 
 Chamillitary man!
