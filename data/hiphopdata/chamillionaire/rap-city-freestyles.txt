I neva take a high atis 
 Debate it 
 The kid the greatest 
 My album anticipated 
 I made it 
 Now haters hate it 
 Problems I can create it 
 My pistol is nickel plated 
 All of my friends can get a F U friendship is overrated 
 You waited 
 You pray to see rival of the mixtape god 
 I treat a track like soft white and make a mixtape hard 
 I get pApaaaaaa, the crib got a fish tank walls 
 These boys is playin' me as a joker better go switch they cards 
 I'm the hardest 
 That's regardless 
 Or wether or not I'm sign 
 Wether I'm in Atlanta or tippin' down in H-Town 
 Boys keep talkin' down 
 Then I just might loose my mind 
 So don't question me 1 mo time 
 Without askin me do I mind 
 Paintin not Picasso 
 Like you macho 
 But that is not so 
 You would not know 
 That is not so 
 What you living alive for 
 He showed his plak, showed his car, showed his crib 
 I'm Watchin' cribs 
 Noticin my crib is alil bigger then his 
 How I live not a G 
 Show is 3 
 Man that's nothin' to me 
 S.M.A.L.L.Z. I lay the hardest verse on a CD 
 For free 
 And I do it so easily 
 Messiah rap thugs 
 Spit fire to pack clubs 
 I'm tired of you actors 
 I'm tired of you act thugs 
 Denyin' that your gat bust 
 I make sense 'cause I make sense even rhymin it backwards 
 Zep snerr yep yep yep yep yep what that mean 
 That mean my cliq is the team of chamillionaire the king of the kings 
 And a game 
 I don't bang 
 Set trips and you broke down 
 Get hurt on your own 
 Turf so before you throw up your sign 
 Your sigh language need say dollar signs 
 He so kind 
 I throw 9 
 At your client 
 While my client gonna co-sign 
 Quick with the metal boy 
 You heard you ain't ready for it 
 I swear my game will turn a HE-man to a skeleTOR 
 My squadron 
 Is the squad of all squadrons 
 My squadron is a problem 
 My squadron make your squad run 
 They see me in my car 
 And ask are you wit Paul 
 I'm like Paul 
 I'm like dawg 
 Can't you see I'm on a call 
 Holla at me later before you holla at that wall 
 Sound of Revenge in stores playa holla at your boy
