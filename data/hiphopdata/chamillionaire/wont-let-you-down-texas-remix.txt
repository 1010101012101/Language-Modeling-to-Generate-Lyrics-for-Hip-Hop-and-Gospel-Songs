It seems that there's a deadly virus 
 That's sweeping through the urban community 
 The side-effects cannot often be seen 
 Because your pockets will not turn green 
 Some thought that there was no vaccine 
 But it seems that we have a cure 
 Chamillitary Mayne 
 Get off your couch and go get it 
 I'm up early in the morning 
 Thinking 'bout getting this money 
 All I know is I gotta get that paper 
 The hustlers told me, that I gotta get it, get it 
 Now I'm getting it the best way I know how 
 I won't let you down, won't let you down 
 I won't let you down, won't let you down 
 I won't let you down, won't let you down 
 I won't let you down, won't let you down 
 I won't let you down 
 I'm up early than a mother 
 Chasing mine 'cause I'm a hustler 
 Then tomorrow everything is gonna rewind 
 Only seven days a week and 24 hours a day 
 That ain't enough for me so I ain't wasting time 
 'Cause only dreams come to sleepers 
 And my life ain't getting cheaper 
 So you know them dollar signs, they on my mind 
 When they ask me where I'm going? 
 I say you already know 
 I'm 'bout to hit the streets and go and get 
 What's mine, won't let you down 
 Dreams of having finer things 
 Riding blades and dreaming should 
 Make you wanna wake up and get it 
 In real life than see the wood 
 In your grip, if you slip and don't grab 
 What you see ain't good 
 Only place that you gonna be 
 Or ever see gonna be the hood 
 I'm up early in the morning 
 Thinking 'bout getting this money 
 All I know is I gotta get that paper 
 The hustlers told me, that I gotta get it, get it 
 Now I'm getting it the best way I know how 
 I won't let you down, won't let you down 
 I won't let you down, won't let you down 
 I won't let you down, won't let you down 
 I won't let you down, won't let you down 
 I won't let you down 
 Boy that word ain't no excuse 
 You know what it mean to me 
 It means you passing over 
 Opportunities repeatedly 
 Write it on a piece of paper 
 Only thing I see is P 
 That paper, paper, paper chaser 
 Better thing for me to be 
 Now, my services ain't for free 
 Make that money multiply 
 Early in the morning I be gone 
 Chase with me, it ain't gonna be no tie 
 Try to explain and give 'em game 
 I don't know why I even try 
 You do the same if you was I 
 But you are you so you gonna lie 
 Make 'em think that you got cash 
 Tell them ladies you got slabs 
 Only thing you get is laughs 
 You can't even bring down half 
 Of the bill that's on that tab 
 Only thing wrong with being broke 
 Is staying broke and making excuses 
 'Bout it like there ain't no hope 
 I'm up early in the morning 
 Thinking 'bout getting this money 
 All I know is I gotta get that paper 
 The hustlers told me, that I gotta get it, get it 
 Now I'm getting it the best way I know how 
 I won't let you down, won't let you down 
 I won't let you down, won't let you down 
 I won't let you down, won't let you down 
 I won't let you down, won't let you down 
 I won't let you down 
 In the hood, having no condition, I was having something 
 I remember it like it was yesterday 
 They was talking down on me and I lost a couple homies 
 I was getting mine while they used to play 
 They say I need to slow down 
 But I ain't slowing down for nothing 
 I don't wanna let the paper get away 
 So when I'm in the streets grinding 
 Ain't no need to be crying 
 The best way that you can help me is to pray 
 I won't let you down 
 Partners that was getting lazy 
 Females that was acting crazy 
 Them promoters that tried to play me 
 Mixtape labels that didn't pay me 
 My old homies that ain't around me 
 Dissing rappers that came to find me 
 Major labels that didn't sign me 
 Left all that nonsense behind me, I got paid 
 I'm up early in the morning 
 Thinking 'bout getting this money 
 All I know is I gotta get that paper 
 The hustlers told me, that I gotta get it, get it 
 Now I'm getting it the best way I know how 
 I won't let you down, won't let you down 
 I won't let you down, won't let you down 
 I won't let you down, won't let you down 
 I won't let you down, won't let you down 
 I won't let you down 
 See, rich people ain't going to tell you how to get paid 
 And broke people act like they the richest people in the world 
 Always telling people with money how to get money 
 Always spending money that they thought they was gonna get 
 Buying things they can't afford, stop making excuses 
 If chronic smoke makes him sleepy 
 He's gonna tell ya he got chronic fatigue 
 If liquor makes him drowsy 
 He gonna say he got that gray goose disease 
 If women keep taking his money 
 He gonna tell ya he slipped off his sleeve 
 Whatever your weakness 
 Stop making excuses please 
 You should not be in couch or in house 
 You should be in route, if you gotta ask where? 
 Then that's the reason you ain't got nothing 
 You don't know how to listen, go get it
