(Chorus: Natalie) 
 I want to know who you are but you still look very nice 
 So will you talk to me? 
 Should I tell you a story? Should I tell you a treat? 
 They think I'm crazy, They don't understand how I feel 
 (Verse 1: Chamillionaire) 
 See, it started off as just a simple conversation I gave her 
 The name of my record company, (Oh you're a sanger) 
 I said my name's Chamillionaire and I'm a rap entertainer 
 (Oh you that guy they talking bout when they be whisperin, ain't cha 
 Bring your name up when they talking and say money will change ya 
 I heard a lot about how you can't deal with your anger 
 Heard the rumors how your always in trouble or danger 
 Not gotta judge you if it's true, there's no need to explain sir 
 You do have a right to be, you seem like your nice to me 
 And like your gonna buy me another drink, yeah would you like a seat?) 
 I tell the boy the same hennessey on ice for me 
 Her drink starts emptying as she's pouring out her life to me 
 Telling me about her goals and how successful she would like to be 
 And invite me to a session of her life and she 
 Seems so damn innocent but something isn't right to me 
 She pulls out her picture phone "I got pictures, would you like to see?" 
 I'm thinking she gotta be friendly as hell 
 Giving a soul to me, it's like an identity sell 
 We never met is the story that my memory tells 
 Telling me tales like she doesn't handle hennessey well 
 Getting into it, getting intimate and into details 
 See, I just met you and you showing me your kids 
 "Who said I had any kids? I didn't bring up no kids" 
 Then who's in this picture, "Man, let you show you just who it is" 
 (Verse 2: Chamillionaire) 
 Umm, I don't remember her name but she look like an angel 
 She wasn't from here, I knew she didn't hang a 
 Round a part of the hood but hey the story gets stranger 
 Cause this stranger was stranger than I could explain you see 
 She said she wasn't married but the rings on her finger 
 Told me she was langin and using the same uh 
 Game I use on women so I couldn't even blame her 
 Spitting the game I spit to 'em when I'm trying to bang her 
 (I bump into this dime, he told me that he used to know you 
 He told me about the loyalty and love he used to show you 
 He said what he said with a passion like it was so true 
 Wouldn't take advantage of the fact that the listeners didn't really know you) 
 There's pictures in my pocketbook, almost got it, I'll show you 
 She digs in her purse and while she fumbles around 
 I find that photo, I'm like "Oh no there's some trouble in town" 
 I turn around as these two officers is coming in now 
 They walk in real suspicious and come and sit down 
 So close, I can see they barrels of the guns to the ground 
 So close that they can listen to either of us now 
 We turn back around and she says no need for whispering 
 Then she tells me that (I don't really give a damn whose listening 
 Try to make it last a long time was my mission 
 And he kept on tripping and then I got pissed at him 
 Hit 'em with my fist and my punches were never missing him) 
 (Verse 3: Chamillionaire) 
 Okay, let's get this straight, your man cheated on you and now 
 You talking to a perfect stranger like it's making you proud 
 And the rest of this conversation she just telling me how 
 It wasn't her boyfriend in the pic but a familiar smile 
 She said (pictures can be deceiving like she knew he was foul 
 Look closer, you'll see a coward who uses a smile's power 
 Fleeing the smoke strength, couldn't stand it another hour 
 So she did what she did then she went to go take a shower) 
 Damn what do you mean? (couldn't tell you that I missin' him) 
 I don't understand what your saying, how did you get rid of him? 
 She dissing him, as I ask her what it is she did to him 
 She stops, Ay keep talkin' I'm listening 
 (I don't wanna tell about the images I'm picturing) 
 Henny spilling then she tell me (For real and 
 I got the feeling of what I'm feeling is that I wanted to kill him) 
 Something's wrong here and I know just who is the villain 
 The poison's getting louder, the moral is getting clearer 
 The officers is looking at us and I can tell they can hear her 
 Told me (It was protection, Reached for it in the stash) 
 The plastic is what she grabbed and she put it right on his ass 
 Bust it before the blast, she thought she was free at least 
 Baby I think you crazy, Sorry I'm pressing for time 
 I gotta go grind, time's putting to resting 
 Now I'm sweating and stressing, this girl's got me guessing 
 That this conversation is two types of evil confession 
 And she pulls a clearer picture, It's my damn ex-best friend 
 How you know him? She told me she was with him at his house 
 Watching movies on Sundays when they be chilling 
 And that's exactly the day that the hospital came to get him 
 The feeling was the worst feeling that she could possibly be feeling 
 Stood up and then I yelled out "Why in the hell did you kill him?" 
 I didn't kill him, I have AIDS, he had sex with 'em and that's crazy
