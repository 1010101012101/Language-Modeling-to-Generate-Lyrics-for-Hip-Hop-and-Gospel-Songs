Paul Wall - Intro: 
 (Repeat 2x) 
 Uh... Paul Wall paper... because I got paper 
 And not ya nose look, get ya mind correct, uh 
 Chamillionaire: 
 I'm the don, I didn't have no date to the prom 
 But I showed up with more then one princess on my arm 
 When it comes down to the rims, that I pick to roll 
 It's like a playbook play, I just pick and roll 
 I make mother nature wet, when I grabbed her ass 
 Now screens fall like rain on my wood-grain dash 
 They should make me the official 20 inch spokesman 
 'Cause what them lil' kids say when they see the spokes "MAN!" 
 Koopa's a punk? That ain't no thought to think 
 Make you use your tongue in no water to wash the sink 
 You'se a dun-carrier, stone-barrier, yung barrier 
 Funny like Eddie Murphy or Jim Carrey, uh 
 If I wasn't the best and it was you they picked first 
 That's like runnin' past Juvenile to go and get Turk 
 Hold up... you need to get your priority's straight 
 The only ice you got is icing on a party cake 
 And since I don't trust you and you don't trust me 
 Call Bubba Sparxx, it's bout to get Ugly 
 When I come through on elbows pokin' out of my Rolls 
 Do the math, who's gon' be left with all the ugly hoes 
 You!, 'cause all the fine women is comin' with me 
 I'm not a minute man 'cause ya women is comin' in 3 
 Does it matter if ya owe me? it doesn't to me 
 'Cause if you don't pay then you can get some trouble for free 
 I'm not the Fresh Prince, Carlton, or Phillip Banks 
 But I make enough cash deposits to fill-up banks 
 Ooh!, did I just say that? I impress myself 
 I'm the god of rap, so I'm bout to bless myself
