(Chamillionaire chorus) 
 Roll so low, but everywhere I go 
 They say oh no (oh no nigga) here comes trouble 
 I roll so low, but everywhere I go 
 They say oh no (oh no nigga) here comes trouble 
 (Chamillionaire verse) 
 Is there nobody to warn him, chamillionaire will bomb on him 
 Its cool your sticking up for him, but if you want you can join him 
 Bombin on him we swarmin, then do it again while he mournin 
 You can't diss me in a dream and not feel regret in the mornin 
 I'm warnin niggas, its gettin' quiet I'm that nigga that'll stop the peace 
 Shoes, you can choose to get bled with the soccer cleats 
 Or I can switch the kicks that are used yo knock out your teeth 
 Drop a bootleg, on a nigga head like a prophecy 
 Chamilli got the streets not halfway entirely 
 All the hoes in the streets are ridin' me 
 So the trash niggas talk don't bother me 
 Yeah, I'm jackin beats how do we deal with all the piracy 
 Can't beat 'em better join 'em universal had to hire me 
 Yeah, see I been an owner ain't a nigga that can fire me 
 Wont say who my biggest buyer be 
 Cause snitchin don't apply to me 
 Niggas was talkin' like the labels didn't desire me 
 In Texas hes a liar mayne, in new york hes a liar b 
 See the world tryin' to see how I spit it so crucial 
 They say chamill is the future, other niggas in neutral 
 May have met drama before but I can reintroduce you 
 They say that chamill is coco, the way I spit is like vodo 
 Wadda ya mean I got ya team members screamin witch docta 
 When a nigga gets choppas, and I make his click pop ya 
 The rap game of late has become a big opera 
 But I'm pimpin' the fat lady, I decide when it stops bruh 
 Don't matter 'cause I'm badder then badder, so quit the chatter 
 Go back and just fix ya data, I rattle ya like a rattle 
 Splata ya into matter, the gun'll make niggas scatter 
 G, eminem even stat'll get mada then mr. hata 
 Texas down to atlanta ain't nothin' for us to get it 
 As long as you know who get it, as long as you know who didn't 
 You know the truth when you hear it, don't ask who is it 
 So until the decisions finished, we doin' it bigga business 
 (Chamillionaire chorus) 
 I roll so low but everywhere I go 
 They say oh no here comes trouble 
 I roll so low but everywhere I go 
 They say oh no here comes trouble
