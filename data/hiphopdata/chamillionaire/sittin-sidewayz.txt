Sittin' sidewayz, boyz in a daze 
 Sittin' sidewayz, boyz in a daze 
 Sittin' sidewayz, boyz in a daze 
 On a Sunday night I might bang me some maze 
 Swisha house, Big Pokey and Paul Wall Baby 
 It's the people's champ, I'm something like a balla 
 The candy paint drippin' off of the ol' school Impala 
 I'm wit that big bank hank that poppi Joe and box 
 Trunk bump like chicken pox, turn the bass up just a notch 
 You see them blades choppin', you see that trunk poppin' 
 Hoes that diss me in the club the same hoes in the parking lot boppin' 
 They see me in the Jag, actin' bad wit T Ferris 
 Open mouth and showcase ice, and you goin' see about twenty carrots 
 I'm wit that gu you on 5-9 double O 
 In the taho on twenty-fo's, I'm the truth I got that glow 
 I'm out that swisha house wit Archie Lee and Coota Bang 
 Sittin' sidewayz on swing the candy paint drippin' off the frame 
 You see me actin' bad I'm showin' out and pullin' stunts 
 Say cheese and show my fronts, it's mo' carrats then Bugs Bunny's lunch 
 Its paul wall baby, I got it made 
 I got a cup full of that oil, and I'm paid 
 Plus I'm sittin' side ways 
 What it dew 
 I'm on the block posted up like a mailbox 
 Slangin' licks on, the grind, puttin' money in my socks 
 A legend in the hood for gold grills and poppin' seals 
 A icon on the mic for showcasing my verbal skills 
 I'm in the club posted up wit some gang bangas 
 Still flippin' the ol' school candy Cadillac on swangas 
 I got a styrofoam white cup full of that drank 
 Lookin' for that dank, my hustle game sharp as a shank 
 Big bank take little bank 80 4's and candy paint 
 Tryna find some honey love, my mackin' game is top rank 
 These hoes peepin' me, ill hustlin' on the side 
 Eaves droppin' my conversations, tryna figure which car I drive 
 I'm on the scene strapped up like I was bungee jumpin' 
 Hit the corner you hear me bumpin' 
 Look at that chrome grillin' woman 
 The trunks popped up, my music screwed and chopped 
 I'm the undisputed king of the parking lot, I'm sittin' sidewayz 
 Maybe O.J's, hoes be goin' crazy when they see me 
 Sittin' sidewayz on them twenty-fo's 
 Watch ya hoe, watch ya money, watch ya clothes 
 Single women's out the mold, glidin' like a ice skater 
 Motor like a snot nose 
 Super sized drop doors mono blocks chop mold 
 Customized deck 'cause the mono block stock lows 
 Sadey Sade, Don Ki, Paul Wall in the place 
 Heads up when you see us, we gon' put it in ya face 
 Red bones scoutin' together actin' a is ass when I blaze 
 Boys smell lemon haze, I ain't the nigga to settle 
 I'm that dude wit the metal, that get hot as a kettle 
 From messin' round wit some cats that ain't got it together 
 Flossin', breakin' of the intersection crossin' 
 Three wheelin' actin' the iz-ass on the rosses 
 S.U.C. in the do', M.O.B on the place 
 Pull up in the driveway, leanin' and I'm sittin'
