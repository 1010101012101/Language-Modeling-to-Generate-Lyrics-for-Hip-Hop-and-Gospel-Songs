(Rasaq chorus) 
 (You and you and you and you and your gon your gon your gon your gon you're gonna love me) 
 Sittin' back huh? waitin for you to act 
 Tryin' to speak a niggas name in your rap huh 
 Till we run you out the game get your raps took 
 Don't remember a niggas name not a fact 
 Snitchin on your own gang thinkin' that's hood 
 Tryin' to diss the color change but can't rap good 
 Tryin' to say they run the game got it backwards 
 Cause the almighty color change ain't havin' that huh 
 (You and you and you and you and your gon your gon your gon your gon you're gonna love me) 
 (Chamillionaire verse) 
 For runnin' these gimmick niggas out of the game 
 I don't need a reason cause it was time for a change 
 For havin' the nuts to diss you speakin' your name 
 Instead of subliminals like I ain't to blame 
 For switchin the style up now I speak with a purpose 
 Instead of just speakin' about my rims in my verses 
 The fake shall fall and the real shall rise to the surface 
 I bought your CD but the purchase was worthless 
 The hottest buzz along with bun b and me truthfully 
 Only niggas with a buzz as big as gorilla mob, slim thug and boosie 
 I'm tired of the gimmicks, I am the realest y'all niggas is goofy 
 I miss that u.g.k. free that pimp c, man let the truth free 
 I heard that e.s.g. fixin to drop scarface the truth see 
 If it ain't in the same sentence as niggas that's real it don't include me 
 Were gettin' the money they thought I was through until 1 2 3 
 I drop my DVD so I'm a baller you got hoop dreams 
 (Chamillioanire talking) 
 And it ain't a shot at paul don't try that nigga. I wouldve said his name.

 (You and you and you and you and your gon your gon your gon your gon you're gonna love me) 
 Sittin' back huh? waitin for you to act 
 Tryin' to speak a niggas name in your rap huh 
 Till we run you out the game get your raps took 
 Don't remember a niggas name not a fact 
 Snitchin on your own gang thinkin' that's hood 
 Tryin' to diss the color change but can't rap good 
 Tryin' to say they run the game got it backwards 
 Cause the almighty color change ain't havin' that huh 
 (You and you and you and you and your gon your gon your gon your gon you're gonna love me) 
 (Rasaq verse) 
 I'm sittin' back while you drap and you act 
 Like yo niggas sellin crack on the tidwell and the trap 
 You ain't done nothin' or seen it, I'm tired of these gimmick g's 
 Only time you used the triple beam was in chemistry 
 Ask anybody I remember it vividly 
 You was at the gas station pasing and soliciting 
 Dissin me? this pussy is a peon 
 Before you rapped with watts you was in a purple neon 
 When he speak you'll be sayin' that its hate 
 How could I let a pussy nigga rep for my state? 
 This nigga said he the king of the streets 
 So ima speak now not forever hold my peace 
 It ain't just him man a bunch of niggas weak 
 They could say it over beats, but wont say it in the streets 
 And if yo niggas fail they put you on your feet 
 And when they call your cell it's a message and a beep
