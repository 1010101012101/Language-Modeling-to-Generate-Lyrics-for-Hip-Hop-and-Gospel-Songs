I try and try to stay in love, 
 But no matter what I do, 
 It just ain't enough, 
 It ain't enough, 
 It ain't enough, 
 It ain't enough, 
 You say it ain't enough, 
 And every time, 
 I think it's love, 
 It just ain't good enough, 
 And we breakin' up, 
 We breakin' up, 
 We breakin' up, 
 We breakin' up, 
 'Cause love just ain't enough 
 Yeah, 
 I had seen potential, 
 In your mental, 
 And was tryin' to make a queen, 
 But I did it for nothin', 
 I was huffin' and puffin', wastin' steam, 
 Everytime I speak, 
 You be twistin' my words, To make 'em mean, 
 Somethin' I ain't say, 
 Then you gossipin', try to break my dreams, 
 So I'm breakin' up with ya, 
 I tried and did everything to please ya, 
 I don't even wanna see ya, 
 The sight of you is givin' me a fever, 
 Think I need a breather, 
 Need ya to give me space, 
 And leave the, past in the past, 
 And keep walkin' pass, 
 When they say that we a, 
 Match made in heaven, 
 Tell 'em I said that that's a lie, 
 So disrespectful, 
 I feel like I've wasted half my life, 
 That's why I ain't in love, 
 Try to say I ain't in love, 
 Then I go right back on my word, 
 And we end up makin' up, hold up 
 I try and try to stay in love, 
 But no matter what I do, 
 It just ain't enough, 
 It ain't enough, 
 It ain't enough, 
 It ain't enough, 
 You say it ain't enough, 
 And every time, 
 I think it's love, 
 It just ain't good enough, 
 And we breakin' up, 
 We breakin' up, 
 We breakin' up, 
 We breakin' up, 
 'Cause love just ain't enough 
 See, 
 It's like I love, 
 And I hate almost everything about ya, 
 I be Indian givin' a livin', 
 Takin' back everything I bought ya, 
 Even Indian givin' a ceiling, 
 When I'm tellin' you get outta, 
 Here, you disappear, 
 Then the next day you come back home to papa, 
 And my mood get madder, 
 When I'm in the streets, 
 And I think I spot ya, 
 Thinkin' I forgot ya, 
 And I'm movin' on 'cause I think I gotta, 
 See I end up losin', 
 Everytime that I try to think I got ya, 
 'Cause you always move, 
 And I want to, 
 But I ain't gon' even stop ya, 
 You be all in my pocekts like feed me, 
 Makin' this type of livin' ain't easy, 
 I be givin' my all to you, 
 All you do is be talkin' greasy, 
 And I know you probably don't believe me, 
 Everytime that you say that you'd leave me, 
 I be gettin' impatient, 
 And waitin', hopin' that you'd make it speedy, 
 So I figured, I'd tell ya the truth, 
 'Cause I knew that it would free me, 
 Give ya everything that I could, 
 But you still kept actin' greedy, 
 You let the world come inside, 
 You shouldn't had been actin' sleezy, 
 'Cause now you pregnant, 
 With rappers that lie on half their cds 
 I try and try to stay in love, 
 But no matter what I do, 
 It just ain't enough, 
 It ain't enough, 
 It ain't enough, 
 It ain't enough, 
 You say it ain't enough, 
 And every time, 
 I think it's love, 
 It just ain't good enough, 
 And we breakin' up, 
 We breakin' up, 
 We breakin' up, 
 We breakin' up, 
 'Cause love just ain't enough 
 Now I can't even lie, 
 That I was in love with you, 
 We did everything together, 
 That lovers do, 
 The love done died, 
 I think it's time to move, 
 In a direction that ain't got nothin' to do with you, 
 And every time, I think of us, 
 I think that it's time that I made some things adjust, 
 My love ain't as strong for you as I thought it was, 
 Baby I'm breakin' up with you now, 
 And it's all because 
 I try and try to stay in love, 
 But no matter what I do, 
 It just ain't enough, 
 It ain't enough, 
 It ain't enough, 
 It ain't enough, 
 You say it ain't enough, 
 And every time, 
 I think it's love, 
 It just ain't good enough, 
 And we breakin' up, 
 We breakin' up, 
 We breakin' up, 
 We breakin' up, 
 'Cause love just ain't enough 
 Talking: 
 I ain't gonna lie, 
 I used to wake up with thoughts of you on my mind, 
 But now you just get on my nerves, 
 Even when you no even tryin', 
 People tell me that it's gonna be better, 
 But I tell 'em that they lyin', 
 My love for you is definently dying, 
 And the way you changed, 
 Is not a good sign, 
 I wonder how you gonna feel, 
 When I'm no longer around, 
 Nah, don't even try to start cryin', 
 After you built me up, 
 And then tried to break me down, 
 It's just a matter of time, 
 Before I had to give you a piece of my mind, 
 And maybe I could spend the rest of my time, 
 Havin' peace in mind, 
 You couldn't even say one thing, 
 That you know that no one know, 
 Everytime I see you gossipin' about so and so, 
 You imitate, 
 You instigate, 
 You turn love, into instant hate, 
 You the reason why I punched my ex-homeboy in the face, 
 In the streets, 
 Chasin' the same money I gotta give to my lawyer to win a case, 
 Tearin' up my rap sheet, 
 'Cause now I got a rap sheet that can't get erased
