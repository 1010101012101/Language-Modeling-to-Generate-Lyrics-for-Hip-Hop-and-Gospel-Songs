What's da supa king K Double O-P-A Say 
 If I say hey, can I get yo number she say, OK 
 U ask for her number and she be like, No Way! 
 Got da boots sayin' What it Do instead of gouday 
 Everybody that think that the Chamillion can't rap 
 I couldn't make a wack rap if my name was J-Mack 
 I'm just jokin mack I take that back 
 But I just gave u a shoud out nigga, u can't hate that! 
 Big twinkey inch leenas, clarion car screenas 
 Got hoes sayin' "Woop, Pull over" like Trina 
 I'm not a drank leena 'cause I rather zip zema 
 Yellow braud named Tina take my clothes to da cleaners 
 I'm above u, u under me like an umbrella 
 Don't even try to front like yo game is much betta 
 If she yellow like the letters in my iceberg sweeta 
 Then you betta not let her leave home 'cause I'll gett'a 
 I'm thugged out foreva, weak... I think not! 
 I'm as throwed as a rock in a shot slingshot 
 Knock, knock! who is it? 
 None of yo damn business 
 It's da color changin' lizard so shut up until he's finish 
 Nigga, I roll chrome and ill pull up in yo home 
 Ice lookin' like I stuck my finger in a snowcone 
 When it comes to this rap, u can't do me no harm 
 I would still be calm with a bomb in my palm 
 And a big stick of dynamite strapped to my arm 
 Three W's dot, get of my dick dot com 
 I don't wear versace 'cause I ain't tryin' to be cute 
 I gave my lawyer da boot 'cause he try to put me in a suit 
 Eat meat with big tig and I'm throwed al pauldin 
 Twenty inch rollers, sean john on my clothin 
 And youavage downtown every semester 
 I might pop up in a drop with blindside and lester 
 Nigga, nig nag paddy wack 
 Hold up man, matter fact 
 I almost forgot to give a shout out to da alley cats 
 My nigga, A D, A Lee, and Slim T 
 Bun B, and Ron C and Big T-I-M-P 
 Gotta post them nigga, out for them boys up on da south 
 No need to spell it out 'cause y'all now what I'm talkin' bout
