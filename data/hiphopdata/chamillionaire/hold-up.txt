Hold up 
 Hold up 
 Self-employed so I'm paying me 
 Stayin' true 'cause it stay to be 
 Won't loud part candy captain then get a ticket then pay the V 
 Rap 84 of the 83, ain't rhyme them and they end with me 
 How you pay to get in the club, and then hate on the pressure y'all pay to see 
 Now we got mob block live again 
 Look at these whips we're riding in 
 Making ball and look easy baby, we don't practice like... 
 Sliding in I'm never super post when 
 I'm getting closer I'm just... the face 
 All the sinners star calling God 
 All the rappers start calling Mace 
 Drop sounding like an earthquake 
 Trunk bound to make an earth shake 
 Every day is a movie for me, you like the destination on the first day 
 Telling me it's a birthday, new shoes and her persuade 
 You should go appreciate the quire, I ain't the one you persuade 
 She ain't worried of the hotel, I wouldn't even get to motel 
 Mess around and take your girl from you then sell it to for the... 
 Oh... have her back, wont' love but I love the stacks 
 So I'm pulling up and then you know what 
 They looking at me like what is that 
 Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up 
 Hold up, hold up, hold up 
 That's what they've been calling me 
 Soon they see me roll up, roll up 
 Don't know what to call that 
 So they call, they call, they call it 
 Hold up, hold up, hold up 
 That's what they call it 
 Hold up, hold up, hold up 
 That's what they call it 
 Soon they see roll up, uh, roll up 
 Don't know what to call that 
 So they call, they call, they call it 
 Hold up 
 Told Brad to send me a track 
 He send me a track to sound like a trap 
 I don't know normally do this 
 But hey when I do it sound like the trap 
 Competition left me in flat, I'm just hoping that you trap 
 I'm just hoping you try to try me 
 Get drag around by your suit tie 
 You can catch me in the forn city 
 They don't even know I rap 
 First album when platinum so they ain't many places on my map 
 Going golf in Iraq, going shopping in Dubai 
 She'll be asking the man forgives and gives me the gift form Dubai 
 Bottle water with a mouse trap, no rat can get to my cheese 
 Her... get no scraps get no bad like her ratches 
 Wanna book me for five G's 
 Read the sign and say stop please 
 Can't knock me, my trunk knocking 
 My making woman looking knock me 
 Call me but I'm unreachable, too trill to be speaker too 
 God loss in my own garage and they couldn't find me for a week or two 
 My trunk are open like pickable 
 Me I'm... to be sipping through 
 Came to blue, all my speakers blue, but I turn 'em up and my speakers do 
 Hold up man, just hold up man 
 Rap to state then pour down 
 Chew up cheese then throw up grants 
 Then guess some bread you know I'm jam 
 It's lunch time, she got one friend, but just one fine 
 One four, one dime, you already know which one is mine 
 Tripping like Jessy Jay, see love and got me in the... day 
 If it comes between hoes and dough I drop off chick and then scoop you pay 
 Might as well, I might as well, passing up dough is a major feel 
 Take the trip to South Africa, but can't lead the the paper like... pill 
 Realest rapper you have ever meet, she want 'n' autograph on her fake breast 
 Too young is just too dumb, girl slow it down and take a break twist 
 Check it out when my lack is out 
 Don't worry 'bout it, I ain't stressed 
 Hot chocolate on my hallo tips they might mess around and get a taste test
