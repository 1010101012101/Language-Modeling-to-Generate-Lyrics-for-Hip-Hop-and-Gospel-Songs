Come back to the streets, yeah (x3) 
 Chamillionaire 
 Even when I'm not there and I'm here like air 
 (Keep sayin' my name) 
 Fresh off the plane from Spain and uh 
 (Keep sayin' my name) 
 Back to playin' the rap game, its yours truly 
 Come on, say it with me 
 Chamillitary mayne 
 You should worry 'bout you while you worry 'bout me 
 At the top of the charts is where you know that I'll be 
 I got the streets on lock and I'm insertin my key 
 I got the game on smash 
 Come back to the streets (x2) 
 Had to make a couple trips to the islands 
 Now I'm internationally known 
 Had to make another switch with 
 My provider got the international phone 
 Had to add a little bit to the rider 
 First class have I asked to be flown 
 And they keep callin me, tellin' me get back in your zone 
 These boys is cartoon characters, too much imagination 
 Just a little too much animation from the maker 
 They know Cham can erase them 
 Travelled all over the world 
 And my experience is 
 Y'all experienceless, y'all ain't experienced shit 
 I grabbed the grammy, I hold the one 
 Got plenty strikes, way more than some 
 Hush your mouth please, hold your tongue 
 No obstacle could ever slow my run 
 When it come to rappin' I'm the coldest one 
 Put my hand in the air and I froze the sun 
 Got the platinum plaque, not the golden one 
 And I look at y'all like I told ya uh 
 Been a boss, win them cars, pull up I bet ya that menopause 
 Yeah menopause like women drawers 
 Yeah I bet I show ya how to kill that noise 
 Phantom of the opera pass 'em by your copper 
 In the new phantom, phantom is a dropper 
 Cash I got a lot you mad 'cause you are not the talk up in the streets 
 And mad 'cause you are not, uh 
 They say its got to be street 
 They say its got to be street, don't go commercial Koopa 
 Its got to be street 
 Major label ain't the only thing universal about me 
 Come back to the streets (x2) 
 And gimmick rappers they focus, most of these jokers is chokers 
 But I don't even play poker, pull 'em down your cheesy lookin' posters 
 They look up to me like a bird 
 I look down on 'em like the curb 
 My movement lookin' like its movin 
 Your movement look like a *screeeech* 
 They callin me 
 Come back to the streets 
 (Keep sayin' my name) 
 They callin me, they callin me 
 (Keep sayin' my name) 
 They callin me 
 (Keep sayin' my name) 
 Come back to the streets 
 You should worry 'bout you while you worry 'bout me 
 At the top of the charts is where you know that I'll be 
 I got the streets on lock and I'm insertin my key 
 Come back to the streets (x2) 
 Yeah, the life I live is just like a movie 
 Every corporation, they tryna sue me 
 Phony people be tryna glue me 
 Till they side they try stick it to me 
 Lucky for me I got the tooley 
 Not black and decker but its black I bet ya 
 Stay in the streets, do that for pleasure 
 So much paper they ask to measure 
 When the ruler or stackin moula 
 Is speakin' to ya don't interrupt 
 Middle finga up on the ceiling 
 Somebody gon eff you up 
 Don't let the black tux fool ya 'cause I am not the one 
 I come out the suit like Clark Kent to make sure your done 
 Rappers ain't real, rappers they fakers and frontas 
 They caucasian in the winter then turn Jamaican in the summer 
 Flippin with Pitman and Straw you know they ain't just some gunnaz 
 Personal trainers that'll brang a couple thangs and make you a runner 
 Gotta like the producers that made this track 
 The producers who made ya stacks 
 Some of you losers need ta face the facts 
 Put up the duece the ace is back 
 Take out the rappers you think are whack 
 Put Chamillitary in place of that 
 Watch how I erase 'em and take the plaques 
 Then I unloosen a case of *gunshot*
