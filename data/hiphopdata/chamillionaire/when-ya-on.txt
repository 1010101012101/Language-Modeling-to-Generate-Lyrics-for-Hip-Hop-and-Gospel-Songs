(Intro - Chamillionaire) 
 They only love you when you on 
 They only love you when you on 
 The only other time is when you're gone 
 They only love you when you on 
 What goes up come do-ow-own 
 (Verse 1 - Chamillionaire) 
 Welcome to 2011 where everybody's the realest 
 Everyone who a midget, say they do it the biggest 
 Every part of your business is everybody business 
 Got my name all in your mouth 
 I should have been a dentist 
 Yeah, everybody done did it 
 Everybody's a critic 
 I'm like "What you talking about" like everybody's a Willis 
 Man, they say they love you when the block on smash 
 Since they so in love, tell them they can kiss my cash 
 Wait a minute you don't like me, well I don't like you 
 These fakers saying that they real. but I see right through 
 The old me, that was the realest person I knew 
 The new me probably the realest person times two 
 (Chorus - Chamillionaire) 
 So when you feel like it's everybody for themselves 
 And the place where you living isn't far from hell 
 And they keep telling you that you were born to fail 
 And everybody say they real but it's too hard to tell 
 Say until I die, I'ma always grind 
 I'ma be okay, I'ma be all right 
 If they say I fail, that would be a lie 
 But there ain't no such thing as a tie 
 They only love you when you on 
 (Verse 2 - Chamillionaire) 
 Hold up 
 You got to be out you conscience 
 They ain't got no sense, and that's why we call it nonesense 
 How they going to talk about what you never accomplish? 
 Like they done, done something that's worthy of my responses 
 Look at the tags, I'm showing them how to stunt G 
 Candy and paper plates, it looks like I got the munchies 
 It's so ironic they couch got money in it 
 But y'all always on the couch and never get any money 
 Where's Cupid? They only love you till you next hook 
 But I don't check the gossip blogs 
 I check check books 
 Ask LeBron he say winning is the best look 
 Every move I make is right, like I ain't got a left foot 
 To keep it real a record deal couldn't stop me 
 I'm bootlegging bullets, you can still get a copy 
 Lucifer is in a pair of heels in the lobby 
 I don't dance with the devil call it trilluminati 
 (Bridge - Chamillionaire) 
 Northside where you at? 
 Northside let me know you got my back 
 They only love you when you on 
 Southside where you at? 
 Southside, let me know you got my back 
 Yeah 
 Eastside where you at? 
 Eastside my nigga you got my back 
 They only love you when you on 
 Westside where you at? 
 Westside let me know you got my back 
 (Verse 3 - Nipsey Hussle) 
 Look, I'm a get money nigga, on a daily basis 
 Road to the riches, potholes in the pavements 
 That's why I follow every rule and regulation 
 Making rap money off this game I've been laced with 
 Uh, and you can blame it on black Sam 
 Blame it on Crenshaw and Slauson Ave. 
 Fly with bad bitch with a fat ass 
 Bail money, big pistol, and a black mag 
 That's how we play it, we living with the fast cash 
 To all my haters, consider this the last laugh 
 I've been the greatest in my city, now I'm past that 
 It's all money ASCAP, broke bitches bad back 
 Please, Louis Locs, Louis backpack 
 First class seats like a pillow top mattress 
 Uh, we can't take it to the casket 
 So I'ma spend these rags 
 Just to laugh at your reaction 
 (Outro - Chamillionaire) 
 I know, I know-ow-ow-ow 
 They only love you when you on 
 I know, I know-ow-ow-ow 
 They only love you when you on 
 What goes up, must come down 
 What goes up, comes down 
 They only love you when you're on 
 What goes up, must come down 
 What goes up, comes do-ow-oown!
