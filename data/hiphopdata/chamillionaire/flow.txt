By: Boe Araya, Yeah, I come through sippin pepsi blue, booo 
 I go better than Maya Angeluo and skip to my lou, skip on these nuts fo show kid, while I blind you wit my ice on my wrist, 'cause I gotsa go grind so much ice on me no Wonder Stevies blind, look at my watch it goes tic toc my chain swang like a granfather clock.Big Beezy comin' through sippin lemon line yo edge up look like a drunk person tryin' to walk in a straight line.Still dropipin dimes I got beef wit jay-z 'cause he sux and he's lazy, his rhymes are weak and crazy, like mike jones on 24's I still tip, I go bigger than Jay-z's and Fantasia's lips. Yeah Jay-z I'm callin you out, you suck, u hang out wit 50 cent 'cause ur not worth a dollar buck. And for chammillionaire you horrible and even worse, you similar to Jay-z's album, God gave me the GIFT, and gave you the CURSE.
