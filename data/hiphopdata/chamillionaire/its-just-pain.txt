I tried to call up God and complain?Then he said "Why ya calling my name" 
 It's just pain, pain. It's just pain, pain. 
 It's just pain, and It's apart of the game 
 I tried to call up God's name 
 Then he said "All ya do is complain" 
 It's just pain, pain. It's just pain, pain. 
 It's just pain, and It's apart of the game 
 Chamillionaire: 
 The industry is a robber 
 My mental be really bothered 
 Not talking to any callers 
 Escape the clutches of pover-ty 
 I'm close to my Mama 
 Ain't really close to my Father 
 The more I became a baller 
 The more I seen him get farther 
 'Cause I don't trust you enough to let you inside of my mind 
 And even if I let you in 
 Couldn't handle what you would find 
 I done been through serious times 
 And don't care if you think I'm lyin' 
 I was grown at the age of 9 
 Wanna get you out of a bind 
 I spent my savings to save you 
 Try to get you up out of jail 
 Had to sign that lil' paper promising that you wouldn't jump your bail 
 But then what you do 
 Jump your bail 
 They want you 
 And want me as well 
 Then the day it happened to me 
 Yeah I hated it it was hell 
 And you had to know that I hate it 
 I hate it I'm irritated 
 It's loud and it's getting crowded 
 My space is getting invaded 
 No nachos but there were some vatos 
 Who said they don't speak no English 
 I'm telling them make some room 
 And he lookin' like what you meanin' 
 And ain't no such thing as team 
 When the General wanna take your spot 
 You the one that's on the bench watchin' 
 I'm the one that's takin' the shot 
 And I seen the hate on ya face 
 At the moment you seen it drop 
 Even people that's really close 
 Try to take ya down from the top 
 What about that lil' fan try to say that I had her baby 
 Ya baby I ain't even met her 
 So it ain't even a maybe 
 Plus her skin was Caucasian 
 She tryin' to reach me daily 
 Ya groupie won't be a lady 
 She obviously tryna play me 
 It's obvious she was crazy 
 Only thing she can do 
 Is go find a stupid rich rapper 
 That South did it she can screw 
 Now she feelin' so stupid 
 In the shows what I said was true 
 If I plan to sleep with a white girl 
 I wouldn't go sleep with you 
 So I keep saying his name 
 And he say I say it in vain 
 And he say that the only time that I call 
 Is when it's some pain 
 Try to mess with my lil' sis 
 And I threw some salt in ya game 
 'Cause I knew you was old enough 
 To be one of our parents mayne 
 But a shame on you 
 You shame 
 You the only person to blame 
 When a 25 person gang 
 Try to jump me and take my chain 
 I was the only person not wet 
 By the punches thrown in the rain 
 And I couldn't hold any grudges 
 I said I forgive ya mayne 
 It was true that he had a temper 
 My Father wasn't being gentle 
 At night I'd wake up to knocking 
 My Mama tryna get in the window 
 Turn on the TV 
 Tryna act like I'm tryna play the Nintendo 
 The house done burnt down forever 
 And no longer sentimental 
 They livin' and lovin' life 
 Until his girl had fell off that bike 
 And he happened to still survive 
 But the future don't look as bright 
 I admit that I got mad ain't ya 
 And wish that we both could fight 
 When I knock on them Pearly Gates 
 Just don't tell me to take a hike
