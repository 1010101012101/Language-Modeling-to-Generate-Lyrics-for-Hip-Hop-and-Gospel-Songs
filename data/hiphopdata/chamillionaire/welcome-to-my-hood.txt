Attention it's the general and I mean this is silly 
 Just listen clearly I know everyone who really hear me 
 Got off the label you can record deal me but can't kill me 
 And if they get mad about this verse they probably get to me 
 I get it done my middle name should be done and straight 
 Hustle outta maybach is how I meditate 
 I'm the one who repped the city up in yellow tape 
 You buy commercials on radio to celebrate 
 The... wasn't something I could ever take 
 When you're this sick there's nothing you can medicate 
 I'm the one Texas rapper that'll get it straight 
 I say a nickname bet your label never takes 
 Super fast or super slow bang it down rewind this 
 New rapper get on and watch how everybody rhymes switch 
 Y'all fakin' cakin' you can miss me with the kindness 
 Y'all some puppets that I wasn't tryna ride the pawn with 
 Nah I don't ride dick when I turn it up real quick you better duck your head 
 Really none of y'all is better when it's touching bread 
 I have a mill and make a mill before I touch my bed 
 Can't get dropped, gon' get gwopped, don't get got 
 Don't flip flop, your chick hot, won't live lot 
 I don't got time, no tick tock 
 Remember djs who tried to charge us to play our songs 
 We got sirotto... and we made our own 
 Who think I'm lying, point out the person that say I'm wrong 
 I will abuse you like children hold up, no any long 
 Karma keeps eating my checks, I call 'em ichecks 
 Wait up I got my weight up and ain't touched the pyrex 
 Wait up you got your weight up homie, nah uh not yet 
 T-pain use autotune, what they do? auto tune 
 Jay-z performin' we just watch them copy all his moves 
 Monkey see monkey do 
 They say take each his own 
 If this who we gon' let get on then all of y'all can keep it grown
