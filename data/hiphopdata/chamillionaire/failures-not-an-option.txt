 Top stay dropn my trunk stay poppn

 Blades stay chopn and the groupies stay boppn 
 Pull up to the curb all the ladies they just hoppn 
 Hmm the Northside body rockn (Northside) 
 Hmm the Southside body rockn (Southside)

 Don't have to see a victory cause failures not an option 
 I keep a ear to the street you can see I'm eves droppn

 Top stay droppn my trunk stay poppn 
 Now turn the speakers up and the beat stay knockn

 Pull up to the curb all the ladies they just hoppn 
 Hmm the Northside body rockn (Northside) 
 Hmm the Southside body rockn (Southside) 
 Hmm we got the whole world rockn 
 You gonna have to see a victory cause failures not an option
