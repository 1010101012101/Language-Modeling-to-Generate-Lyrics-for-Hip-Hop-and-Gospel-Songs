(Talking) 
 Fuck action 37 and a half 
 (Chamillionaire talking) 
 I'm gonne be totally honest wit you right now. I think you know what you need to do. 
 Yeah, you need to go back to him 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 Hey its true that chamillitarys a king, and a king is supposed to marry a queen 
 But you still playin' on various teams, sexin with me while you wearin his ring 
 More you're with me, the better it seems 
 I lift up your spirits, you sharin your dreams 
 Comin' that house, he be cursin you out 
 Gets full of that lean, and very obscene 
 This team or that team, pick a team there's no in between 
 But you wanna play with mr. king, don't wanna go back to mr. clean 
 Leave all the fussin and fightin at home, we under the covers we stuck in the zone 
 Ain't gotta worry bout nothin' we grown, hair gettin' pulled like its stuck in a comb 
 I ain't gotta chase to get it, you clutchin the pillow your face is in it 
 I discipline you like a principal, look at your legs they stay suspended 
 Up in the air I'm touchin you (yeah), you're gettin' excited and rough wit a (playa) 
 On top of my lap while I'm up in a chair, instead of at home stuck with a square 
 Find out feelings gonna get hurt, but ima keep it trill 
 Cause koopa ain't tryin' to lock your girl down, no familys over here 
 Who in the hell was able to tell her man she was with camill 
 Vehicle tinted up in my windows up to match candy over seal 
 I don't have to pretend, I have to spend on platinum to match my grill 
 Just take the trojan out the package, then (get your back) then I rap my skin 
 (When you want a good time) you ask for me, want stress on yo mind you ask for him 
 Its after 10 I snatch you in, you tellin' me you wanna get waxed again 
 After that you go back to him, the truth you never expect to show 
 Sex was strong your stress is low, think hell never detect the glow 
 (He shoulda been a detective though), you thinkin' he ain't gon never know 
 But he knew as soon as you step in the door, you came back smellin like sex and mo 
 He gon let you go
