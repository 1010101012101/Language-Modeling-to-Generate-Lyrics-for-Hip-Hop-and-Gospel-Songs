Its David Banner y'all 
 And its Nitty y'all 
 Chamillionaire y'all 
 And we go a little something like this 
 Have you ever rolled in a Rolls Royce 
 If you want to girl take your clothes off 
 On that Rick Flair money everywhere 
 From the South dog, kush in the air 
 J's on number four, coming down clean, only with hoes 
 Cardiers on, or them new Saces, 50 stacks cash, yeah Nitty got me 
 Big cars, big rims, Southside wearin' lil' Timbs 
 I don't spit bars I buy cars, 
 Still in the hood I don't hang with stars 
 DJ brings your girls and I can bring my G's 
 Rubber-band stacks I guess it's all for free 
 We can spend money like its falling from a tree 
 Leave it all behind and come and ball with me 
 Yeah them big stacks we can bring 'em out 
 Poppin' rubber-bands know what I'm talkin' bout 
 Yeah them big stacks we can bring 'em out 
 Poppin' rubber-bands know what I'm talkin' bout 
 50 thousand up, 50 thousand down 
 Money in the air, money on the ground 
 See it layin' 'round, while them haters frown 
 Where the money go, gotta ghost and lay it down 
 European broads, take 'em over seas 
 Money on the bed, layin' over G's 
 Keep the Dessert E, I've been known to squeeze 
 Turn 'em round and be poppin' like its soda 
 I am so fresh, nobody flier 
 Need a breathe of a air, I am Lucifer 
 Open the garage, you ain't messin' with me 
 Two SS's like the word Mississippi 
 '68 Chevy, what they like dog 
 All grown men, watch the screens fall 
 Now and laters in my paint 
 Throw a deuce up, like I'm with the Saints 
 Hit the block beatin', know you hear it dog 
 Four 15's about to knock my damn tag off 
 Them to the mall, watch I'm 'bout to ball 
 I'ma shut it down, 'cause I'ma buy it all 
 DJ brings your girls and I can bring my G's 
 Rubber-band stacks I guess it's all on me 
 Makin' money easy, y'all make it hard 
 Call Cole He tell him put it on the black card 
 What's up, yeah 
 You know what it is 
 Play-maker SRC 
 Big face lets go, yeah 
 Come and ball with me 
 Come and ball with me
