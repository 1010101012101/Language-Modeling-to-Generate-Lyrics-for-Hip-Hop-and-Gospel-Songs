 (Yeaa) 
 I'm poppin' bottles of patron (poppin' bottles of patron) 
 All night long (chamillionaire and bobby v, we in vip) 
 Its on, its on (hah chamillitary mayne) 
 (Bobby Valentino) 
 I don't normally drink but tonight I'm gon 
 Gone off that rosay, gone off that patron 
 I'm so gone (baby) 
 I'm tryna wash my problems away (jus for the day) 
 Had too much to drink I won't say I'm drunk 
 But I think I drank a lil too much patron 
 I'm so gone (baby) 
 I'm tryna wash my problems away (jus for the day) 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 They mite say I'm such a flirt, lipstick on my neck and shirt 
 Chicks all up in vip, on my neck like its dessert 
 Said I was at work, and that's really where I was at first 
 Now I'm out with her and she tryna make my pockets hurt 
 Any drink that you prefer, any drink that you prefer 
 Knew that that will work, been a playa ever since my birth 
 Money is a curse, but I always chase the money first 
 Wonder why these girls, keep on askin what my necklace worth 
 Made a bunch of money, gotta lotta cars 
 Gotta lotta groupies that wanna be involved 
 I could have 'em all, but my life ain't gonna change 
 'Cause my problems still around the corners waitin 
 I put my CD on, now my money long 
 Mayne I shoulda known, my haterz woulda grown 
 And no I normally don't, but tonight I need a drank 
 So I'm in the club like what you drinkin' 
 (Bobby Valentino) 
 I don't normally drink but tonight I'm gon 
 Gone off that rosay, gone off that patron 
 I'M so gone (baby) 
 I'm tryna wash my problems away (jus for the day) 
 Had too much to drink I won't say I'm drunk 
 But I think I drank a lil too much patron 
 I'm so gone (baby) 
 I'm tryna wash my problems away (jus for the day) 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 They mite say I'm such a flirt, lipstick on my neck and shirt 
 Chicks all up in vip, dancing in their mini skirts 
 Lookin' at them curves, baddest woman in the universe 
 I'm jus tellin' her, I need you to be my passenger 
 Haterz gettin' on my nerves, haterz gettin' on my nerves 
 And they better learn, they gon always get what they deserve 
 Money is a curse, but not havin' money is the worst 
 I'll get back to work, but I'm bout to sip this henney first 
 Said it ain't trickin if you jus spend it 
 Imma run outta dough in a minute 
 Every chick sayin' she independent 
 Starin' at the diamonds all in my pendent 
 I'm not offended 
 Still tryna find out what her friend is 
 She tryna find out where my benz is 
 I'm so glad I got a tenda 
 Its time to get it 
 Tell me when the last time that you've been 
 With a playa this cool, I bet he isn't 
 All eyes on me like a witness 
 Told her I didn't 
 Drink it, yee I really meant it 
 And everybody is all up in my business 
 And I'm hopin this Henny help me forget it 
 (Bobby Valentino) 
 I don't normally drink but tonight I'm gon
