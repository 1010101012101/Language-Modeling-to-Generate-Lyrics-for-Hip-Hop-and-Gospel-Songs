 Gimme that rock, I'll take the shot homie I'll show you what to do with it

 Put you on the game like its McGrady out there shooting it 
 You don't want the plot, you ain't hot 
 You out there shooting bricks 
 Step ya game up 
 But I won't even call no names 
 You can jump, my boy will dunk it on ya like LeBron James 
 Ray Allen behind the arch will teach ya 'bout the long range 
 Making that ball catch on fire, look like you saw a flame 
 You know the West ready to rumble like my candy, Carmelo 
 And the East Try'na sweep like a dirty yard blowa 
 With ball-handlas like my first single ya know ya 
 Boy Allen I. gonna show ya how to really cross ova 
 And the only selling out, is the seats in the arena 
 Shaq will ya break down, go pick the pieces of your team up 
 You think your beating Kobe down court then you're a dreama 
 Your defense on the court sounding like "Tell me have you seen em?"

 You tryna beat up in the paint, Kenyon Martin says "ya can't" 
 Ya every shot gettin' blocked, like bad cheeda at the bank 
 Ya got the illest jumpa? better be careful what you think 
 Cause Yao Ming blockin ya shot like he don't care bout your rank 
 Yeah, How did you think that you could actually win something? 
 Kevin Garnett under the net and that's when you win nothing 
 Stop ball-hogging playa, pass it to Tim Duncan 
 Alley-Oop! 
 Towards the hoop! 
 Catch it and Tim dunk it 
 The Heat is on fire 
 Gary Paytons got the rock 
 Pull up behind the key, and pop, all you can do it watch it drop... 
 He's hot 
 Alonzo got ya posted up on the block 
 Bout to show ya what he got 
 Time is running off the clock 
 You've got, Payton confused with somebody that would lose 
 Carmelo breaking your ankles like you didn't tie your shoes 
 Leaving another ego bruised, to the crime scene without no clues 
 The 2006 All-Stars...
