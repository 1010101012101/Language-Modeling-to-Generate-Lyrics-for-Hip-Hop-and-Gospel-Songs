Is you a hot girl if not girl 
 Can't be touchin' my hot spot girl 
 I can't in that cot girl 
 I'm runnin' wit Michael Watts girl 
 This is our world what you can't you tell 
 Just look at the ice on my benzale 
 I bet it's green but it ain't stale 
 TVs in a 6 hundred V12 
 While the beats swell and I'm slugged up 
 The camillion be teted and thugged up 
 My money be gettin' all jealous 
 You gotta move I can't be hugged up 
 They bugged up selective sounds that offence 
 Some ballers blockin' watchin' they knock us 
 'Cause we ridin' and can't even drop us 
 On choppin' they love that 
 I see that big ass and I love that 
 Like juvenile back that ass up in my direction 
 And let me rub that 
 Swishahouse don't need to dub that 
 Go get you some swishahouse sock 
 Go get you some new shoe 
 Put swishahouse on top of your reeboks 
 Boy if your tryin' to get rich 
 Go and get some swishahouse stock 
 'Cause if it ain't platinum or gold 
 Then it didn't come from that Michael Watts
