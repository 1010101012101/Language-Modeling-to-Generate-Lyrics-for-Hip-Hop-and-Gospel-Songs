 Fuck you, lookin' at nigga?

 Hold up, hold up, oh we got a problem here? 
 We got a problem here, we got a problem nigga? 
 It's the return of the trill niggaz, hide your stash 
 (Stash) 
 We dressed in all black and got the hood on smash 
 (Smash) 
 I rock ya like Dame Dash 
 (Dash) 
 One shot, one kill 
 Ask anybody 
 (Body) and they gon' tell ya Bun real 
 (Southern Smoke) 
 It's a done deal when I pull up on ya 
 Calico get unleashed, niggaz clearin' the corner 
 Perfect to me and ten 
 (Me and ten) 
 We movin' much weight 
 And this one for pimp in a penitentiary upstate 
 Damn, come on Bun, wait 
 Naw nigga, this one dedicated 
 To pimp in a penitentiary upstate 
 'Til he come home in his name we ballin' 
 We never forget the homies on lock or the fallen 
 Band I.T., Young L.o and Bad Azz Bam 
 Sean Wee and Big Munst' and we ain't givin' a damn 
 If you need a kilogram, two, three or a dozen 
 Come on down to Texas, holla at your country cousin 
 I can show you how to get stains 
 How to flip 'caine 
 Show you how to grip grain 
 How to grip stains

 Yeah, I learned how to shoot a MAC-10 'fore I turned 12 
 Hot shells burn, black skin turn pale 
 You out to get mail? I show you boys how to sell yay 
 And how to tell what it weigh without a scale 
 Motel 6, hard blow sell quick and I ain't gon' sell shit 
 You'll sell nicks and dimes, twenties 
 Even three dollar club sacks 
 Buy y'all private, guaranteed to come back 
 I turn sand into rocks with soda 
 No wrist, just a fog tryin' to rock your quota 
 Microwave on top of the stove, these hands is cold 
 I stretch the books, see how much water it hold 
 Most niggaz think the water should be cold 
 Really hot, keep it warm 'til the finishing lot 
 Not cold nigga, listen and watch 
 We takin' bricks on the road, try to form your spot, nigga 
 Yeah 
 (Southern Smoke) 
 You don't hear how we gettin' it 
 Then you gettin' in the way 
 I'm gettin' rich, niggaz gettin' pissed 
 'Cause most pussy niggaz play 
 We can let that metal settle differences 
 Let a clip set a date, point guard position 
 I'm assistin' it so an opponent better pray 
 Of my environment, yeah, it's the Messiah 
 So close to the truth than you that your fiction 
 Cannot deny a real nigga from gettin' higher 
 Don't believe me than check my prior 
 Record, I said I'm on fire 
 Your poof like your time expired, liar, haha 
 I can show you how to get stains 
 How to flip 'caine 
 Show you how to grip grain 
 How to grip stains
