Jealousy in ya eyes (That's what it is boy) 
 Envy in ya eyes (That's what it is boy) 
 The label that's on the rise 
 Tell 'em the name, Chamillitary Mayne 
 You can love me or hate me 
 But I'm still gonna get my money 
 Envy and jealousy is all I see 
 (Yeah) I can see the hate in ya eyes 
 You can try but you can't stop me 
 I keep it real, I keep it street 
 So tell everybody that don't like me 
 That I can see the hate in ya eyes 
 If you the best, beef is Somethin' you should expect 
 'Cause the rest be feelin' that to be as good as the best 
 It's obvious I'm the Best, so I'm lookin' for less 
 Of the friends that just pretend I'm only lookin' for checks 
 Say hello to the Villan, I would say It's nice to meet you 
 But It's not, so I don't pretend it is when I greet you 
 The same Villan that run with you, try to beat you 
 So I chase Money like the payment that's on ya lease due 
 Gimmie that (That) Gimmie Gimmie that (That) 
 Yeah, that is why the wallet fatter than a city rat 
 Feelin' that, till It's really really fat 
 You hungry and tryin' to eat like??? Give ya snacks 
 We ain't havin' that, you feelin' me? Yeah 
 They don't want drama, they ain't prepared 
 And I'm feelin' they scared 
 Go tell 'em I said Imm'a make a killin' this Year 
 Headed all the way to the top, Like there ain't a ceilin' in here 
 (I keep goin' Baby) 
 You can love me or hate me 
 But I'm still gonna get my money

 You ain't really like the after taste 
 So I'm back to put the music business back in place 
 Let's get back tryin' to crack crack crack the safe 
 My moneys??? Tryin' somethin' I don't have to waste 
 But I do, Keep somethin' that you feelin' me? Yeah, 
 Then Imm'a keep soon as they see me ain't assumin' a thing 
 They thought I'd fall apart, They don't really like that after taste 
 But I come in like "Gimmie That" and snatch the steaks 
 Can't see the truth in your face You must be blind, Deaf too 
 Representin Texas, Imm'a rep it till the Death too 
 They say I'm sick, When I spit they Sayin' achoo 
 'Cause this type of cold is the cold they wanna catch too 
 But there's a catch too (too) Because you can't win 
 Haters hatin', we respond (Don't get mad then)

 Let 'em hate 
 And pay attention to the screen, It ain't Shinin', It's clean 
 They could see as soon as they see me, ain't assumin' a thing 
 Jewlery that you say is mean is PG-13 
 My wrist like a Horror flick, It make the cool girl scream 
 Tell 'em to calm down, the pinky Ring's the preview 
 I put another set around my neck to be the Sequel 
 So mean that Money's the reason people turn Evil 
 So I get checks, you upset soon as I leave you 
 But be true, if you feel what I'm doin' is wrong 
 But It's better to be that (Gimmie Gimmie That) 
 It's better to stack big wads, then get coins 
 So I chase Money myself and won't let you join 
 You can love me or hate me 
 But I'm still gonna get my money 
 Envy and jealousy is all I see 
 (Yeah) I can see the hate in ya eyes 
 You can try but you can't stop me

 So tell everybody that don't like me 
 That I can see the hate in ya eyes
