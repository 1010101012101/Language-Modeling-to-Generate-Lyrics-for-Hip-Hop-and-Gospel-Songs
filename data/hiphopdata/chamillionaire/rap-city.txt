Chamillionaire an open vibe in the XXL 
 And the writer in there said that you had trouble to sell 
 Trouble to sell ???? 
 How can I have trouble cause hell 
 I drop the Sound of Revenge and I like double the sales 
 You thought I fall off a give me the sound of success yeah that's next 
 Pop up in my video throw my rocks up like I'm Aztecs 
 You got your ass wrecked 
 Seen the size of my last check 
 Figures in my wallet got it green enough to match shrek 
 Crime did the two 
 Couple of my screws is kinda loose 
 Niggaz talkin' that like they had body guards behind they booth 
 See me out and pet me on the back like my masseuse 
 Cat in the hat 
 Rap 
 Save all that for mama Seuss 
 The price is high couldn't get half of a hooker book ya 
 Wouldn't go out and try to purchase half a hooker would ya 
 I have my other brother see ya in the hood ya butchad 
 Have some white boyz jump out the bushes like Ashton Kutcher put ya 
 Money on it 
 And I'll win it like I want it 
 Take money that use to be yours and go spend it like I own it 
 Mad cause you know that you only gon matter for the moment 
 If ya a gansta matter of fact it don't matter till you shown it 
 My convicts at entertain 
 Like Akon and T-Pain 
 I run wit Akon that got an arm for T-Pain 
 Show you the bat man like that boy was B Wayne 
 Ya grill layin on the bloody part of the sheet stain 
 Contain yourself wouldn't care if you drank the jug or not 
 Hop bop dropped and run you ova like a juggernaut 
 Do not care how many cousins that your cousin got 
 Twist you up till they can't fix you like that puzzel box 
 Lames Complain about the state of the game 
 They do the same as the lames and they go cater to dames 
 When Wu-Tang was the thang boyz was braided wit fames 
 When the West Coast was the thang boyz went datin insane 
 Now the truth is they say I love ya ya ya grill 
 And they studda when they see me its Cha Cha Chamill 
 Bandanas bananas enough one's to peel 
 Enough guns foreal 
 Ya guts will spill
