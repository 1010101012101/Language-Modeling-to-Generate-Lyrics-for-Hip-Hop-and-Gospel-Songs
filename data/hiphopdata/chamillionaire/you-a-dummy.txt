Speaking with a purpose but some folks out there be hatin' 
 They be sayin' money talks I talk it but you ain't relatin' 
 Some people in a business try to cheat me like they say 
 But I am the "Mixtape Messiah" and the South is my congregation 
 You ain't know I get the dough then gets some mo 
 You don't believe me you a dummy 
 You ain't know I get a load for every show 
 You don't believe me you a dummy 
 Used to be stylin' on the court got it eliminated in my sport 
 Now that Jerseyville coach can see that I'm hotter then a torch 
 All the seven foot white boys that use to tell me that I was short 
 But money longer then a mother but I'm to tall to drive a Porsche 
 I play my album for the source on the clock radio of course 
 Now I'm in the middle of nowhere doing shows until I'm horse 
 Now my middle finger is up and I show the industry no remorse 
 I'm the Messiah of mixtapes quiet get up and rejoice 
 Gettn screwed before I was chopped never was signing Michael Watts 
 If the nots wasn't in the box while I'm thinkin' bout buyin' stocks 
 Buyin' Jordans outta the picture didn't have the money to by the socks 
 Now I'm sittn on 28's ruff ridin' like the lotts 
 Used to be workin' at fast food they had me washin' pans and pots 
 Now I got fans that will stand ruttin' for me like I'm Pac 
 Who would've known I would blown for makin' song 'bout the cops 
 Cops pulln up at my shop tellin' me they like my drops 
 You ain't know I get the dough then gets some mo 
 You don't believe me you a dummy 
 You ain't know I get a load for every show 
 You don't believe me you a dummy 
 CEO that I can flow and I'm bout to blow 
 You don't believe me you a dummy 
 Guest who got the last laugh now 
 You don't believe me you a dummy 
 DJ Drama that's my boy 
 DJ Smallz that's my dawg 
 DJ Khaled keep it thoro label exits like the laws 
 They will tell you they are helpful if it goes wrong they not involve 
 Tony Neil that's my partna I'll be on them conference calls 
 Used to know a girl name Flamiesha her girl looks like she jaws 
 She was captin' 'cause she was captin' on the drill team and thought them was jawers 
 When I was after wasn't a rapper back in the day I used to draw before I used to ball at the time I was with Paul 
 Choppin' up that number four that was back when I was with Swisha 
 Had a partner name Amaud rest in piece homey I miss ya 
 Was a man with of plan but realize they always diss ya 
 That's until you win a Grammy bet them ladies try to kiss ya 
 You ain't know I get the dough then gets some mo 
 You don't believe me you a dummy 
 You ain't know I get a load for every show 
 You don't believe me you a dummy 
 CEO that I can flow and I'm bout to blow 
 You don't believe me you a dummy 
 Guest who got the last laugh now 
 You don't believe me you a dummy
