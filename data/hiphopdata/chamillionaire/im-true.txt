Here lizard-lizard-lizard, uh 
 It's the almighty king koopa, chamillionaire 
 The color changing lizard, the mixtape messiah 
 Please stand for the ghetto national anthem, let's go 
 Forget what them boys is talking bout, I'm true-I'm true 
 You riding swangs you gripping grain, I do-i do 
 You candy red you candy blue, you popping trunk you jamming screw 
 Don't know about you, but I'm true-I'm true 
 (Paul wall) 
 Forget what these boys is talking bout, we wipe boys down 
 In south park on mlk, on Sunday we clown 
 From the streets of antoine, to the homestead hoods 
 From mo city to studewood, it's all good 
 I'm riding on platinum grey, with z-ro and trae 
 Gon let the top down, it's a beautiful day 
 Haters jealous on the sidelines, running they mouth 
 'Cause I roll with t.i.p., the king of the south 
 Boys know I'm paid in full, so they clocking my dollas 
 Me, poppy, joe and fox all riding impalas 
 I'm breaking bread with mike jones, and slim thug the boss 
 It's paul wall, still representing swishahouse 
 I'm with my boy big kaila, I don't bar no hater 
 I'm on the grind for paper, I'll holla at ya later 
 Forget what they talking bout, I'm in love with my wealth 
 I ain't gotta say I'm true, cause true speak for itself baby 
 Forget what them boys is talking bout, I'm true-I'm true 
 You riding swangs you gripping grain, I do-i do 
 You candy red you candy blue, you popping trunk you jamming screw 
 Don't know about you, but I'm true-I'm true 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 They say I'm the greatest of all time, and I say who and they say you 
 If she's a dime tell her I'm fine, and she'll say true-true 
 Turn up the bang if you into, something color changing the rims do 
 Sound like a train 'cause when I stop, they be like choo-choo-choo 
 And I'm thugging too homie, the heater kinda like al bundy's hand 
 Believe me every time you see me, it's gon be in her pants 
 If I do a 
 Crime and you snitch, homie the heater will snitch too 
 'Cause if the police come around, it'll be pointing at you 
 Somebody give mouth to mouth to this mic, after it melt 
 Cause the only rapper out rapping me is me, after myself 
 I hope you internet thugs, that will swear that I ain't the tightest 
 Have cyber sex with cita, until you catch a virus 
 Why is he saying this, to piss boys off 
 I officially claim myself, the rap king of the south 
 The say I'm the greatest of all time, and I say who and they say you 
 And I say naw, give that title to the late great DJ screw, rest in peace 
 Forget what them boys is talking bout, I'm true-I'm true 
 You riding swangs you gripping grain, I do-i do 
 You candy red you candy blue, you popping trunk you jamming screw 
 Don't know about you, but I'm true-I'm true 
 (Lil' flip) 
 The definition of a pimp is (me), 'cause I ain't doing shit for (free) 
 I got my own label now, if you ain't heard it's (clover g's) 
 Now me and will chasing the scrill, we pulling up on chrome wheels 
 Nigga, your royalty check looking like my phone bill 
 Quick to capping picture snapping, paparazzi follow me 
 Yeah I'm platinum I'll slap him, if he smoke up all my weed 
 I love to speed on dubs and spre's, bitches leave the club with me 
 Snitches mean mugging me, don't make me bust my fucking heat 
 We popping trunks and smoking blunts, that sticky-ickie (ooh-wee) 
 Last year I did a mill, now I'm bout to do (three) 
 I bring the heat on every track, it's five g's for every bar 
 Just because I'm in a porsche box, don't mean I like the spa 
 That don't mean I like the car, you know I'm down to break your jaw 
 Just because I burn rubber, that don't mean I like the tar 
 We ghetto stars in every state, like pimp and bun we keep it trill 
 And if you ain't heard, it's lil' flipper and chamill' 
 Forget what them boys is talking bout, I'm true-I'm true 
 You riding swangs you gripping grain, I do-i do 
 You candy red you candy blue, you popping trunk you jamming screw 
 Don't know about you, but I'm true-I'm true
