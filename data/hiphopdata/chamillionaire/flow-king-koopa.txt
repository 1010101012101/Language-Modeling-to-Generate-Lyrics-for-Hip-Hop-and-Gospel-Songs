We still here, ain't goin' no where 
 SwishaHouse 
 Listen 
 Man Chamill, that nigga still handlin' steel 
 Hoppin' out the Sedan Deville, ay man just chill 
 Leave em' alone, see niggaz never plan to feel 
 The back-hand until they talkin' or you came in his grill 
 I don't care, undercovers still yearnin' to stop me 
 Same retailers I sell it to will burn em' a copy 
 Then sell it to you, but the CD's burning is sloppy 
 They earning they dollar, that I'm supposed to earn in it's got me 
 Pissed and ag'd, get in the slab, gimme some gas 
 Fixin' the track, this nigga bout to kick me some ass 
 (Repeat after Talking) 
 This be the last time I let niggaz get me for cash 
 Gimme some gasoline and burn his crib into ash 
 Hold up Watts niggaz is cheap sayin' I charge to much 
 'Cause I'm raw nigga what? 
 Y'all can't compete, y'all niggaz suck 
 If I gotta deal with the embarrassment of y'all niggaz stuff 
 Then mo' money will ease the pain, bar'd that bar in ya cup 
 Hold up Watts, boot-leggers? Them niggaz be scared 
 But a mind full of scared 
 Is better then a mind full of lead 
 Nightmare, wake up, pillow red, mind in his bed 
 Now Koopa's joking go back to sleep, never mind what he said 
 Look for that First Round Draft Picks, nothin' but net 
 I gotta homie street-sweeper, and his cousin is tech 
 Doesn't respect? I'ma put ya tongue up in the deck 
 And put my dick in the speakers and put nut in ya neck
