(Talking) 
 Consider this evil empire thing... as a threat 
 (Chamillioanire chorus) 
 These haters is gettin' on my nerves (nerves) 
 Tried to warn 'em but some people don't learn (learn) 
 I'm gettin' so sick and tired of haters and liars tryin' to be known in my world (world) 
 These haters is gettin' on my nerves (nerves) 
 I ain't havin' it homie that's my word (word) 
 Promise ima do more then exchange words 
 We gonna exchange greetings and somebody gon get hurt 
 (Kiotti verse one) 
 (Yeah) its kiotti and killa cham 
 Trunk raise up and were milla slam 
 I'm sick and tired of this childrens play 
 Show 'em ya strapped and them kids'll scram 
 Nobody wants to get feelins man 
 Ask around boy I'm still that man 
 Tim the tool man will drill this man 
 Till I put his feet in my ceiling fan 
 Oops I mean my blades 
 Spinnin around like some ceilin fans 
 Koopa why is you grinnin man 
 I almost had to kill this man 
 Its young geek and chamillitary 
 Them boys stand at attention for them 
 Bitches ask till hes drenched in bath 
 Call the coach and tell 'em bench his ass 
 Nope I ain't havin' that, quit surroundin my habitat 
 I'm clappin first I ain't clappin back 
 Ima a pro with the tool and I ain't talkin' mac 
 I sprained my shoulder last week I ain't holdin' back 
 Pussys better hold ya back (brrrrrap) for your holdin' that 
 (Chamillioanire chorus) 
 These haters is gettin' on my nerves (nerves)

 (Chamillionaire verse) 
 I ain't really gon have all this debatin 
 Bout who really true and who ain't fakin 
 Continue with this nonsense and I'm takin' 
 It to the streets on 'em heres your invitation 
 Talkin' 'bout me givin' information 
 Partici-hatin' 'cause I'm twistin daytons 
 Don't like what I'm sayin' better switch the station 
 Treat a nigga like twizzler I twist and break him 
 Drama ain't a thing I'm the king of that 
 Keep hatin' I gotta let the team attack 
 Squad bring terror have 'em leanin back 
 Soldiers froze ya like we in iraq 
 Computer, only time you seen a mac 
 TV, only place you seen a gat 
 How to get well you can dream of that 
 King koopa grab the metal thing and (blap blap) 
 Take that, take that like puff you can huff and puff 
 But I had it up to here with all the battle stuff 
 I ain't playin' no games we done had enough 
 Houston, niggas can't handle us 
 If you got it on your mind betta handle up 
 The hate that I'm hearin isn't addin up 
 (I'm a grown ass man) you ain't man enough (ha ha) 
 (Chamillioanire chorus) 
 These haters is gettin' on my nerves (nerves) 
 Tried to warn 'em but some people don't learn (learn)

 (Kiotti verse two) 
 Everytime I'm fixin to chill a hater pop up I'm feelin' ill 
 Is any doctors in this house I think I might need some benadryl 
 It's like touching a strippers tits they not feelin' real 
 God I hope you will forgive cause this the nigga I'm fixin to kill 
 Why he won't mind his bis? I knew I wasn't offenden him 
 Knew I wasn't offenden them 
 I'm postin up on some twisted rims 
 We to grown to be actin' like its lets pretend 
 Plus they know me better than actin' like we the best of freinds 
 No peace for a houston Texan 
 So I tote heat I'm used to plexin 
 Bring that beef in my direction 
 I'll leave your teeth lyin' in the intersection 
 I can only warn you one time the next I think you gotta learn this lesson 
 Nothing in this world can protect him 
 No seat belt can help when I wreck him (g-yeah) 
 (Chamillioanire chorus)
