If being rich is bad for my health 
 Than baby I'm goin' be ill forever 
 And I'm known to make ladies melt 
 U boys better (get on my level) x8 
 Cause your boy burn it up 
 Man that chrome plated woman in the hood steady hummin 
 Tha messiah who they summon and the mixtape king is coming 
 Better hope it's the rap and not the split something on yo woman 
 Cause the only thing we got in common is the common denomin 
 Later a hater is less and never greater 
 From continent to continent I cross 'em like a fader 
 My garage full of RAAA yeah jaguars and gators 
 My hand were the okies goin' land like the raiders 
 Grippen, Flippen which vehicle am I picken 
 Got a set of chrome feet and a bunch of beat about yo sticken 
 Lil kids stick their face on the frame and start licken 
 Still rollin' the old school with the hood things drippen 
 Lady is gravy her hair is in the wind 
 The vehicle that's older than your parents is a sin 
 My baby a lady got yellow candy skin 
 Open the garage and look in I'm like where should I begin 
 Driver name Rick I call him Ricky Retardo 
 He's lost in the garage like a game of where is Waldo 
 Ask where he's at and he's like lookin' for your Gallardo 
 Look in every spot but I've been lookin' for an hour bro 
 Sweet tooth candy is on every single car no starburst 
 Rappers on the interior of my car flow 
 But I'm the rapper that stay burstin on that star though 
 That line went over there heads baby but y'all know 
 Keep plenty chicks in the coup like a farm yo 
 Keep a car but I don't ever see a car note 
 You O.J Simpson with those broads though 
 You like 'em white and skinny like a Marlboro 
 And I keep a chick on each arm like jack tripper 
 If she thicker I'm a picker if she not I'm a skipper 
 If I land on a island like the skipper 
 Than sex on the beach I'm a give her is not liquor 
 You can never think of a thought that is as throwed as me 
 Real got to be real got to know it's me 
 Paper chasin we racin but you ain't close to see 
 I'm Chamillionaire but who the hell you supposed to be 
 Got a crib in LA so the Hollywood sign will notice me 
 Surprise sign knocking doors down is how you notice me 
 How many cribs really his somewhere over three 
 That real estate is Chamillions place lets show 'em B 
 If being rich is bad for my health 
 Than baby I'm goin' be ill forever 
 And I'm known to make ladies melt 
 U boys better (get on my level) x8
