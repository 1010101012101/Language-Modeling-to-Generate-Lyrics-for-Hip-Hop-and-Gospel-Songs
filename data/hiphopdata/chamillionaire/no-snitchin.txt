This is for my gangstas, real niggas, ballas, trill niggas 
 North side, South side, chunk ya deuce up 
 This is for my gangstas, real niggas, ballas, trill niggas 
 East side, West side, chunk ya deuce up 
 Plenty niggas get they head turned red for da bread 
 Start off with da information, load it up in ya head 
 Couldn't hold it, so it turned out its sumthin he said 
 Wut he tell da FEDS (he need someone to call) 
 Your decision was to snitch and they was there to listen 
 When he told what he know, said they barely was trippin' 
 Less time, now da niggas in a better position 
 Unless you count the fact that the streets know he was snitchin 
 He was lookin' at a 30 but he only did 10, how your years turn to months, can he tell you dat, and 
 He ain't really gotta answer, just the sweat in his hands 
 Will he make it out to make it, mmm well it depends 
 Everybody know the info you was tellin' ya friends 
 Plus the streets know the deals that you made with the pen 
 Russian Roulette, yep nigga bet the barrel will spin 
 You hear that, yeah nigga that's the sound of revenge 
 Walk down the right road, 'cause the streets is so cold 
 You betta take ya life slow or you'll miss it 
 Listen to da G-Code, if you know what I know-oooow, then you'll keep yo mouth closed 
 We don't tolerate snitches 
 If you gon live that crime life, I hope you hold dat 9 tight 
 You live life like a pussy then dats prolly what you die like 
 I neva eva loved a sucka, them ain't really my type 
 Rat snakes, yeah mayne the game is full of wild-life 
 Don't wanna do no time right? 
 You wanna live that high life 
 Like go withdrawl, have a hundred thousand in ya eye sight 
 Enter ya crib, see the clouds peepin through ya skylight 
 You be a copycat,(???), 'cause mine right 
 That's what he told me but I didn't listen 
 Doin' crime for a dime wasn't my intention 
 You insane, think his name sumin I will mention 
 Only snitches need someone to tell 
 Alota niggas in the game, hustlin doin' they thing 
 Usin' codes on the phone with they usual slang 
 If you know what he know then you won't say a thing 
 You wouldn't need someone to tell 
 Careful 'bout the life you lead, ain't smart with ya life, you plead, the streets will ignite ya T, like you ain't got the right to breathe 
 (Cough) To choke on da realness, reality is what the fake don't know how to deal with 
 Words leak from the teeth, but he'll say seal it 
 Then go get a undercover brother he can chill with 
 Find a nigga that be hustlin to make a deal with 
 But the streets will hold court for him and'll deal with it 
 This for the G's, street jugglin, move da fire 
 When you talkin' what you talkin' it ain't through the wire 
 Police pull you over, now they callin you a liar 
 You got amnesia, don't even know the dude beside ya 
 You don't know, you ain't sayin', you ain't heard what he said 
 Told you a closed mouth ain't gon neva get fed 
 A open mouth'll get you county instead of the FEDS 
 Some scared niggas speak up so they'll be less in the red 
 Niggas can't deal with no 95 so they day-today budgeters 
 It's the hustlers that get put away by the customers 
 You upstate, niggas use to be southerners 
 Here the streets make the laws and don't answer the governors 
 We the niggas that's too real to snitch on a snitch 
 But make a snitch turn to puff with a flick of the wrist 
 That ain't gon get in arguments, just go get you a clip 
 And they gon think about the consequences, let 'em repent 
 (Talking) 
 Man hold up, you a real nigga and you ain't got nothin' to say when they come question you, just keep it 100, and go on a chunk ya deuce up
