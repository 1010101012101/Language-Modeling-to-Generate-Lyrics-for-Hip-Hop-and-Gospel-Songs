I'm ready to get it started 
 You betta tell em the hardest 
 You hate on me then you retarded 
 I'm a get mine reguardless 
 I'm seein the rap the games needin me to come back to the mixtapes 
 And relieve them 
 Fans geekin Rap sales peakin hey in need of someone to believe in 
 I'm seein that they ain't me I'll wreck pollo beat for no apparent reason 
 And I think it's huntin season 
 So I'm cockin back and squeezin 
 Look at the fans talkin bout who spit better lines 
 I don't know what they doin but Prepare for mines 
 I don't just spit a line better than kevin federline 
 You better tell I'm really better than who ever rhyme 
 Hold up let me out this chair 
 Hear ya'll talkin bout ya hustles ain't no profit there 
 Hear ya talkin bout ya deals but that ain't profit square 
 Ya'll get lil royalties I get profit share 
 So um What up 50, what up buck what up lupe what game 
 What up jeezy, luda what up Ti what up wayne 
 Just cause I say they name don't mean I'm insane 
 Cause I'm shoutin out all the artists that make me step up my game 
 If I say I'm better than 50 his fans gonna complain 
 If I say I'm better than wayne his fans will do the same 
 I don't wanna ruffle feathers so maybe I should explain 
 Maybe it's MOE Me over Everythang 
 I'm better than you know who so better that it's a shame 
 I'm better than lil mama I'm better lil zane 
 I'm better than lil blang imbead it in your brain 
 I'm better than every rapper that rap with a lil name 
 You should be pissed that I'm pissed 
 I know some of my past records was a hit or miss 
 Don't try to twist up my ish and twist it into a diss 
 If you gon twist up what said then you should twist it this 
 Lauren London can get kissed on the lips 
 And bill O' Reilly and Don Imus can get hit with a fist 
 Hakeem I'm the dream stop missin the swish 
 And MTV my name is what ya missed on the list 
 Wait let me rewind I really don't want them 
 To think I'm tryin to diss I realy just want them 
 To know I'm not the type that will take lauren to london 
 Matter fact lauren be lucky if I take her to lunch man 
 It's the king of the hill from the land trill 
 What up Elise can't you see I'm Movin in for the Kill 
 Either I could drop one song a year like a skillz 
 Or we could get off in the streets it's time to pay these bills 
 Gas prices gettin high and I'm knowin I got a fleet 
 I'm Skinny than a mutha I'm knowin I gotta eat 
 So any rapper out here that no that they got a beat 
 Better never ever allow the instrumental to leak 
 I'm in the studio everyday and I'm lettin em loose 
 Black and decker in the trunk it ain't nothin but tools 
 Wanna run a money marathon it ain't nothin to prove 
 My closet lookin like a stadium it's nothin but shoes 
 J millz I ain't forgot about the cover you Gave me 
 I appreciate it G I'm still one of them crazy 
 Rebels out the texas and I'm runnin em daily 
 Now I'm back off in the streets like F u pay me 
 For jackin the texas swagger famous hand me the dagger 
 Nah nevermind cause these fakers don't even matter 
 Mixtape messiah 4 august 27th 
 And this just a throw away 
 I got a drive full of em let's go 
 Yea they get offended by words but You can tell it's fear 
 They say ball til you fall the fall is never near 
 They all say that they ball but Who you tellin dear 
 I manage a whole lotta money like kenneth crear 
 Manage a whole lotta money like shaka zulu 
 You think that I ain't good at ramen you out ya noodle 
 Safe sex mayne ya label tryin to prostitute you 
 I'm on the grind up earlier than the cockadoodle 
 What up killer mike it's grind time mayne 
 Rap game in my aim I'm like bang bang bang 
 Only rappers gettin mad the ones who Can't maintain 
 Now the rap is gettin back to the mixtapes mayne 
 First they tried to hate when I left said I'm history 
 Came back they tellin me they miss me 
 Twenty g's for this watch are you sick G 
 A .com on my arm this is 50 
 Hataz talkin actin like they some motormouths 
 And I'm a automatic start and turn ya motor off 
 Crib big mtv can't even show the house 
 Cause it would take 30 minutes for them to show the couch 
 F sales (what ya mean) bank account is great 
 Wreckin it since 98 and never took a break 
 Until recently throwin my rob back in the lake 
 Rap game tried to give me kibbles till I took the stake 
 Stop barkin baby I'm not starvin 
 Gettin bucks you crazy I'm millwalkin 
 Ya concience is talkin about caution 
 Slit ya wrist (slit) I'm Sharper than al sharpton 
 Koopa -Easy
