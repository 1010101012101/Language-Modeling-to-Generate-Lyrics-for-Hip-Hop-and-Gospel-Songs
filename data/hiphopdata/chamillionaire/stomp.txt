(Feat. Rasaq) 
 (Intro: Rasaq) 
 Yeah, it's color changin click 
 We in here foreva baby 
 Chamillionaire, It's Rasaq boi 
 (Hook: Rasaq) 
 It's color change when we comin' and we make it bump 
 It's color change when we comin' 'cause we raise the trunk 
 It's color change when we comin' 'cause we make it krunk 
 It's color change when we comin' 'cause we breakin chumps 
 5th wheel open up my nigga make it jump 
 Put ya hands on ya knees baby shake ya rump 
 Put that money in ya pocket nigga make a lump 
 Break a bottle on his head till it make it bump 
 Rasaq: 
 Your boys in ya squad, I don't bar none of them 
 I don't care if you rollin' with a hundred men 
 No respect to none of them 
 I'll bring it to any one of them 
 And if y'all hull me niggas know I'll come again 
 You ain't rollin' like a real nigga supposed to 
 I see the fraud in ya soul in finna expose u (hoe ass nigga) 
 King of the streets, I'm a dethrown u 
 All the thugs chose me, the lil gurls chose u 
 You done did it, u bumpin but you was timid 
 You nothin' you is a gimmick 
 I see you I'm comin' with it 
 On 20's and somethin' kidded 
 Lil bumper and windows tinted 
 You pushin me to the limit 
 I'm leavin' with somethin' dented 
 I'm jumpin' in somethin' rented 
 You suck and you fuckin' finished 
 U bustas ain't fuckin' with us 
 I'm crushin your every sentence 
 All you do is scream your name through your ad-libs (who? Dyke Jones) 
 Nigga we the hardest, your ass is average 
 Shit we go harder than some calluses 
 Don't make me laugh, how yo ass gonna come back from this (You can't) 
 I'll wreck yo ass like an accident 
 Ice out the chain and show niggas that we stackin it 
 Nobody jackin it, come through I'll be packin it 
 I get a thrill just to see a nigga slap from it 
 No love for you niggas I'm unpassionate 
 When I come to the swishahouse nigga I'm smashin it 
 Step in the door, ain't nobody smokin' grass in it 
 All the real niggas left, I wonder what happened kid 
 Show respect to the boys before u 
 Without them nigga, it would be no u 
 Fasho dude u a hoe dude

 Chamillionaire: 
 Gimmick ass rappers don't deserve to breathe I know that Texas down to ride for me 
 Gimmick ass rappers don't deserve to breathe cause Mississippi down to ride for me 
 Gimmick ass rappers don't deserve to breathe I know that Georgia down to ride for me 
 Gimmick ass rappers don't deserve to breathe I know Ohio down to ride for me 
 Chubby ass, pudgy ass, cover ya face with a skully mask 
 Hatin' on ya click, dummy ass, shrek look alike, ugly ass 
 "Koopa what should I do cause Watts really ain't payin' me no money" ass 
 Signed a weak ass contract but you pretend everything sunny ass nigga 
 Foolishness will stop, tell the public what you got 
 They seen ya DVD so obviously it's not alot 
 Hipnotic? 20 dollars in the studio that you lied about 
 Show money gotta split ya money with T.Farris and Michael Watts 
 You can't afford to charge less 'cause then you realize 
 You wouldn't have nothin' left so you can stop the feedin lies 
 Dyke don't want it with us and his yes men don't want it eithaguys 
 He was dissin Magno like he ain't wanna see his people rise 
 Said he was lazy, he's a loser, wasn't gettin' cash at all 
 He was doin' shows and he said that Mag was playin' basketball 
 Said they was ready to go but Magno wouldn't answer cause 
 Found out that was a lie, u don't believe me go and ask him y'all 
 Where he at? Pissin in his white diaper bag 
 When I write light ya ass up if ya like Mike ya mad 
 Tryna make a comeback betta wave a white typa flag 
 Any nigga that listen to him are like Mike a fag 
 He was whinin after the show 6 months ago in Dallas 
 Tuck ya panties in you're a long way from Wonderland, Alice 
 U don't want no Cham challenge 
 U don't wanna see Cham mad as he can get 
 'Cause he's legit and he will cush ya damn talent 
 I sold 40,000 mixtape messiah's in one month 
 At 11 dollars a CD, how much dat is? 
 It's one hunch, it's too much 
 Got a suburban and an excursion, it's too much 
 Ninja bike with the rims twirlin, it's too much 
 My impala got 'em hurtin', it's too much 
 Pussy niggas gettin' crushed for real, virgin
