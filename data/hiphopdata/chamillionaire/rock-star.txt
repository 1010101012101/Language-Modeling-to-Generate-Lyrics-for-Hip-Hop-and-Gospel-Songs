Rock Star! 
 Rock Star! (Rock On) 
 Rock Star! (Rock On) 
 It's Rock 'n' Roll! (Rock On!) 
 I got ladies that love my ladies 
 Haters that hate my haters 
 I'm a Chamillionaire, but got billionaires for my neighbors (Rock On) 
 I been havin' paper, I been havin' stacks 
 The crowd screamin loud in every city on the map 
 Got the groupies goin' crazy, they don't know how to act 
 I bring 'em backstage and tell 'em baby just relax 
 Rock on, they see the jewels is so sick, l like flu spit and flu cough 
 Take it off and you lost, the tough talk get tooled off 
 Keep the 4 iron near, keep on thinkin' that it's for golf 
 Nickel Plate on your head, silverware's food for thought 
 Grammy winner the haters is like 'How could this happen?' (how?) 
 On the red carpet so much they mistake me for Aladdin (wow?) 
 How I'm a rapper with revenue like a rock star? 
 If I'm near you can believe the black card is not far 
 'Teen Spirit' ain't what they smellin, they yellin' 'Where that Nirvana?' 
 The crowd is rockin' 'n' rollin', them swishers full of marijuana 
 They judgin me like your honor, your daughter's here with her mama 
 They tell me that I'm a charmer, more freakier than Madonna 
 Famous look right at me and said 'Know why I got my ligher up?' 
 'Cause like the throwback P. Diddy alias I'ma 'Puff' 
 See how we rippin up tickets that police be writin us 
 Do like Michael Jackson's complexion Mr. and lighten up 
 Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star 
 I got 'em screamin loud as they be screamin comin' out broads daily 
 Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star 
 She's sayin' she's in love with me and she is probably your lady 
 Like a rockstar (Lady) 
 Like a rockstar (Lady) 
 Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star (Baby) 
 Catch me gettin' into trouble like it's my job (Baby) 
 When they listen to the cops come then I'ma (Rock On!) 
 I been havin' paper, I been havin' stacks 
 The crowd screamin loud in every city on the map 
 Got the groupies goin' crazy, they don't know how to act 
 I bring 'em backstage and tell 'em baby just relax 
 (Verse 2 (Lil' Wayne)) 
 Rock 'n' Roll Fly 
 Bitch behold I 
 I am the shit 
 Hear the commode cry 
 Hear the guitar scream 
 That Double R lean 
 And if it's for me 
 Then its foreign 
 I mean my cars, I mean my clothes 
 I mean my hos, I mean my flows 
 You dress different round me and I'ma clean your nose 
 Step into the line of fire, jalapeno toes 
 Compared to big foot, you just twinkle toes 
 I get ya girlfriend wet like wrinkled clothes 
 Rock star- like, money, drugs, freaky hos 
 World tours, walk-throughs and TV shows 
 My hair's out (Hey!) 
 No Shirt (Hey!) 
 I stage dive (Rock Rock!) 
 I crowd surf (Hey!) 
 I'm an oddball 
 I'm on my hot shit 
 Reportin' to you live from the mosh pit 
 Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star 
 I got 'em screamin loud as they be screamin comin' out broads daily 
 Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star 
 She's sayin' she's in love with me and she is probably your lady 
 Like a rockstar (Lady) 
 Like a rockstar (Lady) 
 Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star (Baby) 
 Catch me gettin' into trouble like it's my job (Baby) 
 When they listen to the cops come then I'ma (Rock On!) 
 I'm so cool, I'm so smooth, I'm that dude, I'm so fly 
 Groupies tellin' me like a spy, the ground be tellin' me that I'm fly 
 The cloud see me and they cry just to get a glimpse of I 
 Got Mother nature so jealous she knockin' pigeons out the sky 
 Can't help it, I got 'em rockin' they pelvic-bones 
 And losin clothes 
 The higher my album sales get 
 They love me, that's right you nailed it 
 They treatin me like I'm Elvis 
 Naked pictures she mailed 
 She licked on a stamp and melted 
 So save your rap for the rookies, 'cause there ain't no rappers here 
 A show you do in a club is a show we do in the ampitheatre 
 We packin stadiums, ladies come in I'll introduce ya 
 It's too packed to maneuver, crowd look like LaLaPalooza 
 We outshinin the losers, know I ride with the Ruger 
 You know I'ma producer, weapon upside ya medulla 
 Got no time to seduce a Super Head type of seducer 
 Groupies tyrin to snake me, but Koopa denyin' Medusas 
 Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star 
 I got 'em screamin loud as they be screamin comin' out broads daily 
 Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star 
 She's sayin' she's in love with me and she is probably your lady 
 Like a rockstar (Lady) 
 Like a rockstar (Lady) 
 Ladies love it when your livin' like a rock star (Baby) 
 Catch me gettin' into trouble like it's my job (Baby) 
 When they listen to the cops come then I'ma (Rock On!) 
 Rock Rock (Rock On!) 
 Rock Rock (Rock On!) 
 We gonna keep on rockin' 'n' rollin' till the wheels fall off. 
 Know what I'm talkin' bout? 
 Chamillitary Mayne! 
 Young Money! 
 We the new Red Hot Chili Peppers 
 We on fire 
 Sold out arenas 
 Tearin up tour busses 
 You Know how we get down. HaHa 
 Rock On, Hol Up, Hol Up, Hol Up 
 Tryna get the Ozzy Osborne paper mayne 
 I'ma throw a pool party 
 Me and the playboy bunnies gonna be swimmin in a pool of a paper like Scrooge McDuck. HaHa. 
 Your Invited. If You can swim. 
 Rock On
