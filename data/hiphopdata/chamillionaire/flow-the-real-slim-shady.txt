 Swisha house baby

 Y'all frontin like y'all be 
 This is the real paul wall 
 Ya feel me?

 (Paul wall) 
 Y'all act like you never seen a white person before 
 Throwin' up the 44 with a braided up fro 
 I got more dough than a baker 
 Yellow bone like la. laker 
 I'm a straight play breaker 
 And a fake hate shaker? 
 Might swang to make a maker? 
 I'm a foreign car driver 
 Even when I'm dead and gone 
 Still ain't nobody live-r 
 I'm a swishahouse rider 
 By the name big tiger 
 Me and kodarolla ridin' on stretch motorcycles 
 I done 
 Put some swangers on a pt cruiser 
 Paul wall could catch boppers 
 If I rode on a scooter 
 I'm a busta abuser 
 And a hater head bruiser 
 I'm breakin boys off 
 Swangers on a land cruiser 
 I'm a U of H cougar 
 Joe collins runnin' track 
 I done bought my sister 
 Nikki taylor gucci contacts 
 I'm a 
 Block bleeder 
 A acres home preacher 
 TV screens fall and I'm watching moesha 
 More ice than a freezer 
 More hot than a stove 
 I could pass gas and make my trunk close 
 'Cause I'm 
 Paul wall 
 Yes I'm the real wall 
 Ridin' a foreign car 
 That you ain't never saw 
 (Chamillion intro) 
 Golds in my mouth 
 I'm up in the swisha house 
 I represent for the north 
 And represent for the south 
 You know what I'm talkin' about 
 Nigga please get crunk 
 Please get crunk 
 Please get crunk 
 'Cause I'm gold grinnin 
 I'm also chrome spinnin 
 And I'm thug life livin' 
 And messin with your women 
 You know what I'm talkin' about 
 Nigga please pop trunk 
 Please pop trunk 
 (Chamillion) 
 Look 
 I have no use for robitussin 
 Promethazyne or visine 
 Sip no lean or codene 
 My real name is hakeem 
 Don't call me that, ya hear 
 I'm bout to change my name from chamillion 
 To The Chamillionaire 
 My arms in the air 
 And four fingers off my fist 
 I'm that nigga you need to find 
 If you tryin' to stack some bricks 
 I'm the one you need to holla at 
 If you tryin' to stack some chips 
 I'm in love with my ice 
 But the ice is too cold to kiss 
 I'm not in love with you miss 
 Get bolted by the slam 
 Show my mean mug 
 'Cause a mean thug is what I am 
 I'm about to spend 10 grand 
 Why because I can 
 2 carrots in my fridge 
 And 32 up on my hand 
 God damn I ain't lying girl 
 You can stop tryin' 
 If you's a hot girl 
 If not girl 
 Them drinks I'm not buyin 
 On fire hot fryin 
 I don't need help 
 I'm about to act a donkey 
 And chop this rap up by myself 
 Actin' a damn fool 
 Pack-packin a damn tool 
 If i-if I act like a gorilla 
 My brother act like a gorlila too 
 Got-got me a fubu 
 Got-got me a gat too 
 Got-got me a brand new redbone with a tattoo 
 Gotcha head bobbin up and down like a see-saw 
 20 inch rims on me car 
 Never fake 'cause we raw 
 Lookin' all up in my mouth 
 And gold teeth's what she saw 
 Watch me kick in the door 
 And wave up the 4 4 
 (Chamillion outro) 
 Whoa, chamillion represent that desoto block 
 Antoine, 44 in the door fo' sho' 
 What's up paul wall 
 You got somethin' to say dog? 
 (Paul wall outro) 
 I just wanna shot out to some of my patna's 
 DJ confusion, DJ lady d, the Hollywood boys 
 Def jam blasta, DJ aggravated, walter d 
 You know what I'm sayin' 
 All them boys that be playin' our music on the radio
