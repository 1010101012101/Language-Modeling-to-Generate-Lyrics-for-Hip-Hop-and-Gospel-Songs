I don't really know if its dead or alive they called for an ambulance they said one of them wont make it till march 27th but in the mean time I'll give the check up 
 Hip hop just died heres a warning (somebody ring the alarm) 
 Hip hop just died heres a warning (somebody ring the alarm) 
 Hip hop just died heres a warning that revenge is coming 
 If Hip-Hop should die before I'm great 
 I'ma do more than just murder a mixtape 
 I'ma do more than just murder a mixtape 
 I'ma do more than just murder a mixtape 
 Pollution I smell that in the breeze 
 But let's try not to get mad at the trees 
 Tell 'em all not to get mad at the leaves 
 Let's get mad at the idiots that planted the seeds 
 When it comes to mixtapes I'm known as the Messiah 
 I influence these other rappers to get tighter 
 Go to every label and murder the checkwriter 
 Whoever hired him we should pray they get fired 
 As soon as they kick him out on Broadway 
 Show him how to make his hip "hop" the hard way 
 I bring the whole south with me you should just call me 
 And we can make a pi√±ata out of him all day 
 And I even finnin' to be gentle 
 You can murder Seline for sending me the instrumental 
 It ain't coincidental how they can get in your mental 
 Then the minute you see it they tell you it was accidental 
 All rich rappers do is complain 
 Everybody arguing to be on top of the game 
 9 out of 10 rap about coppin' them thangs 
 Or how the gat go braat braat braat braat when it bang 
 And it seem like H-Town got the popular slang 
 Platinum grills everybody else coppin the same 
 Platinum grills everybody else coppin the same 
 Then everybody run to that like it's the poppinest thang 
 What is that man? Where the hell your swagger at? 
 Who going to be the first to bring the old swagger back? 
 Doing what I do seems like boys mad at that 
 You was sharp homie where the hell your dagger at? 
 I was a fan sitting up in the stands 
 When it was M-E-T-H-O-D MAN 
 You hear M-E-T-H-O-D for Cham 
 When Rakim was still thinking of a masterplan 
 And it worked! And now I'ma fit up in my place 
 Stay humble stay focused and show that I got grace 
 You better not point the burner to my face 
 Better load up the burner and then turn it to myspace 
 Preach! The same rapper that die hard 
 Bruce Willis with a vest under the Izod 
 Wanna beat you? Man I ain't gotta try hard 
 You getting beat by the internet and your iPod 
 The label don't want you to be Master P 
 Took the master and put it right after P 
 "Bump it master" but I won't let them master me 
 You're an idiot if you're giving up your masters free 
 Corporate America is f-ing up the rap game 
 While we argue about which rapper got the phat chain 
 You real gangsta you pulling out your gat man 
 The real gangsta is whoever own your rap name 
 Like Busta said "You should give a performance" 
 That's the truth us rappers shouldn't try to avoid it 
 If you're married to the game go ahead and divorce it 
 Especially if it's rap we ain't even enjoying it 
 I am not going to point a 'K at a magazine 
 Because of what someone say in the magazine 
 I can pull out my chain yelling "Bada Bling" 
 Or on a G4 plane sitting by the wing 
 Telling you "the leather feel good don't it?" 
 For 50 Thou you'll have a real good moment 
 The plane's landed by the pilot that flown it 
 I am not an idiot 'cause I'm trying to own it 
 Little kids look at me and say that "You best" 
 One point three million in the U-S 
 Some label exec getting in a new desk 
 I get an award they tell me that I'm too blessed 
 Honestly it just excited my family 
 I just hide the medicine inside of the candy 
 Get cured by the music blasting out of your Camry 
 If not I'll hide the medicine inside of your brandy 
 'Cause I know that y'all boys gotta be drunk 
 To think that Chamillionaire gonna be a industry punk 
 I'm a in-da-streets problem you will get stomped 
 Get kriss-krossed off when the kid jump 
 Some of them try to rhyme but they can't rhyme like this - jump 
 Some of them try to rhyme but they can't rhyme like this - jump 
 Some of them try to rhyme but they can't rhyme like this - jump 
 Some of them try to rhyme but they can't 
 Because I'm the miggity miggity mack that stacks the plat plaques 
 But rap is so wack so I'm back to spit crack 
 March 27th I'm back and that's fact 
 So rappers that can't rap get ready 'cause it's a wrap!
