Chamillionaire is so - crazy, 
 Look at the face of the media like you - crazy, 
 You thought I'd fall, I'm sorry dawg ya - crazy, 
 Mirror mirror, on the wall you are - crazy 
 Talking: 
 I wonder if it's still called memory loss, 
 If you can't remember the last time you lost, aha 
 Yeah, 
 The only time I lose, is when it's my memory, 
 Haters comin' around here, talkin' about "Remember me?" 
 Naw amnesia, Cham leader apparently, 
 You were just a follower, now I'm about to set a speed, 
 If they can't keep up, with no one ahead of me, 
 Victory is just, what I said I can achieve, 
 'Bout to be trouble, you scared? I think you betta leave, 
 Hope you don't have asthma *ahum*, go head and breathe 
 Talking: 
 Yeah, pull out your inhaler, 
 You're going to have to catch a breath for this one, 
 This the victory lap 
 Yeah, 
 Garage lift up, it'll create some enemies, 
 Got that "S-S" in the middle of it like Tennessee, 
 Sorry but the Ferarri there, isn't friend-ly, 
 The engine be runnin' *pvroom*, like it's scared of keys, 
 If she a freak don't handcuff her, just let her be, 
 Get your G's, like five letters after the letter B, 
 Photocopy, couldn't possibly find a better me, 
 Hot, like two letters after the letter C, 
 In the name of gang, that's been runnin' the game, 
 Help me explain and tell 'em, Chamillitary mayne 
 I am a hustla, you gotta pay me, 
 No time to sleep, I'm in the streets on the daily, 
 When you a hustla, no bein' lazy, 
 I got it whenever you need it, just page me, 
 Hustla music, 
 Hustla music, 
 Hustla music, 
 I'm hustlin' music, 
 You thinkin', you thinkin' I'ma lose baby, 
 Either you stupid or you gotta be crazy 
 (Crazy) 
 (Crazy) 
 Talking (Chamillionaire and Lil Ken: 
 L K: Famous! 
 C: Aha, you ready Famous? 
 L K: Hold up, I gotta take these twenty G's and take 'em to the bank G, handle up. 
 C: All right fo' sho, I got it. 
 Yeah! 
 The Hype Williams, to y'all rookies you know that this is, 
 A motion picture so sick, that I call it motion sickness, 
 Jonathan Manyon the manuscript, so hold ya pictures, 
 Just like you posin' for strippers and tryin' show ya riches, 
 Materialistic, I got a lot materials, 
 Um, I gotta lot of... Uh Chamnesia, 
 I'd probably break up with my own self and go solo, 
 Verses for a promo, oh no 
 Verse 4 (Lil Ken): 
 I'm a monster, 
 I be cummin' like dicks, no homo, 
 A lil' to gangsta for them flicks, no photos, 
 I'm high like gas, rose sticks and blow dodo, 
 Aha that Texas (shit), fo' shodo, 
 Fresh of the underground circuit, 
 Straight into this overground circus, (clown ass) 
 I'ma do numbers like the lotto, 
 Shoot 'trone straight out the bottle, 
 You not lookin' at a role model, 
 So, I say it one time and one time only, (say it) 
 Not ya buddy, not a pal, or ya homie, 
 You know me 
 I am a hustla, you gotta pay me, 
 No time to sleep, I'm in the streets on the daily, 
 When you a hustla, no bein' lazy, 
 I got it whenever you need it, just page me, 
 Hustla music, 
 Hustla music, 
 Hustla music, 
 I'm hustlin' music, 
 You thinkin', you thinkin' I'ma lose baby, 
 Either you stupid or you gotta be crazy 
 (Crazy) 
 (Crazy) 
 Talking: 
 I'm like Bruh Man on the fifth flo', 
 'Cept I'm comin' in through the front do', 
 I ain't gotta use the window 
 Let's go, 
 Now please pass my passport, because of it, 
 I got groupies with longer hair than Cousin It, 
 Brazilian ladies who tell me, "This bra just doesn't fit" 
 Twins in two rooms, try to make me double dip, 
 Should of known I would win yeah, you thought you had it (what?) 
 Like my cars and my weapon, that is automatic 
 Talking: 
 This the part of the horror flick, 
 Where the white lady trips and falls, 
 And me and Famous escape with the millions, 
 Aha! 
 Verse 6 (Lil Ken): 
 Two heavy weights from the Lone Star State, 
 And if thirty's the new twenty, I've been high since eight, (haha) 
 Me flop, just wait, not turn blue (nigga), 
 Tell 'em that I'm Famous, thought I was a new (nigga), 
 Thought you knew (nigga), when I'm applyin' pressure, 
 The brothers play the back, lookin' like some rhymin' extras, 
 'Cause I'm the star of the movie, can't move me, 
 Don't try either, either, 
 I'ma roast you then +Bake-er+ like Anita, 
 Fuck (hot), my records got the feva - stop actin' like a diva, 
 They tellin' Cham how they feelin' me, 
 I'm a Universal asset, ya whole team liability, 
 So I ain't finna leave, so you ain't finna breathe, 
 I could cut it up, or keep it cool like the winter breeze, 
 My piece and chain symbolize respect, 
 My mouth piece symbolize a check, yep, (Chamillitary mayne) 
 No kids here, so how you gonna play me? 
 Boy tryin' cash out, so how you gonna pay me? 
 I am a hustla, you gotta pay me, 
 No time to sleep, I'm in the streets on the daily, 
 When you a hustla, no bein' lazy, 
 I got it whenever you need it, just page me, 
 (No time to sleep, I gotta keep goin') 
 The hustla of all hustlas, I'll sell ya somethin' I borrow, 
 Sell night to the day, and then sell today to tomorrow, 
 (No money, don't even bother) Got some paper then call her, 
 Call George Bush's daughter, I'll sell her Katrina water, 
 (Why?) 
 Just to get at her father, just so they have some evidence, 
 I'm slick enough to take precedence from the president, 
 America's worse nightmare, is right here, 
 I stay sizzlin' like flares, look up, (*pheerrm*) 
 It's quite clear, it's my year till I hear, 
 Somebody smoother, then I'm the ruler, I'm like where, 
 Is he at just let me know I'ma bury him, 
 Under the rocks in the bottom of my aquarium, 
 The chances of me losin' this time are very slim, 
 If he was bright, then I'm turnin' him down to very dim, 
 If it ain't me in the sequel, then there will be no sequel, 
 You know the obvious reason is 'cause there is no equal.
