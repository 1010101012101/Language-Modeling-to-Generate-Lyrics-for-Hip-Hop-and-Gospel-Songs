 It's the mixtape messiah

 Man don't try to diss and then patch it up 
 Yeah they tried to hate but I'm platinum plus 
 I just bought a buildin 
 And just snatched a bus 
 They still actin' like they don't matchin' up 
 That's wassup yeah that's enough to make me make you look like you're dumb 
 Ain't gotta call you an idiot cause you make yourself like like you're one 
 Ask me if I made some money I told her that I made a lil 
 Jack the track from play 'n' skillz go get ya burnas and pay ya bills 
 To that company in houston that bootleg what I come with 
 I got 2 million to drop on you in court costs if you touch this 
 On the CD or I am cpr heard the music ran outta breath 
 Rap game still alive 'cause I snatched the music up outta death 
 I don't really mean disrespect to none of y'all but I confess 
 Don't compare me to another artist that's rappin' now because I'm the best 
 (Break) 
 Tell 'em that I said that I'm the best 
 (I hear them burnas now) 
 Tell 'em that I said that I'm the best

 Tell 'em that I said that I'm the best 
 (I hear them burnas now) 
 Y'all know who run the internet 
 (I hear them burnas now)

 Scrath ya head and wonderin how we all got in here with tools 
 Wanna know who break the rules then you should know that I'm the dude 
 My promotion game is smooth so my control will be on cruise 
 You could be the biggest journalist I'll probably look at you 
 Like you crazy if you ask me bout 50 in an interview 
 'Cause I'm 'bout me and I don't really care about what others do 
 If it ain't 'bout me then take the question and adjust the question to 
 I am sure not the rapper that a label can abuse 
 You can be the biggest bumblebee my buzz get big as you 
 Its part 3 I had come again I just released part 2 
 Its drainin me but its still goin' down like water in a pool 
 (Yeah) that's a quarter add a penny count it up if you have to 
 Realize that we the guys with more 26 than your couch do 
 I'm not him and I'm not him so watch who you talkin' that mouth to 
 'Cause if its money I run harder than y'all boys in my house shoes 
 Take a look in to the sky you can see its goin' down tonight (its goin' down tonight) 
 Let 'em know it's the time for the victory who down to ride? (lemme noe if you down to ride) 
 You know rap will never die its gon live as long as I'm alive (as long as I'm alive) 
 It's the mixtape messiah
