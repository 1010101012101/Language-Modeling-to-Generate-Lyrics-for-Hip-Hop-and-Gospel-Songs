 Now let me roll my sleeve up 
 While you go get your g's up 
 I'm a boss I cut ya off if I think you a 
 Skeamer 
 Had to get my team up and had to get 
 My cream up 
 Plus that Wu had told you that the cash 
 Rule everything huh 
 And for them Katrina now we don't wait 
 For fema 
 We get back up on our feet and slab a 
 Candy beama 
 I can be no dreamer and plus my girl a 
 Diva 
 Keep her happy and that nappy 
 Wet as aquafina 
 I'm start ya from the cleaners and plus 
 I'm gripping real wood 
 We repped that before pimp died and I feel 
 Like we still should 
 Show 'em how the grill look them 
 Swangers on the wheel should 
 Get the chips then purchase whips 
 Because it make me feel good 
 I be like...

 I got some good advice for ya 
 If they get a mic for ya 
 Make it for these boys 
 Who drop the syrup in the sprite soda 
 Screwed up Southern type flow-ers 
 Say that he a dice roller 
 Just becarefull this ain't something you 
 Should bet your life over 
 Hope the lizard geico ya 
 'Cause you better be insured 
 You gonna come to Texas with that then 
 U better be for sure 
 You should hit that kitty pur 
 No this Jag is not for her 
 U can even see the piece 
 That's right my chest look like a blur 
 Let these critics chopped in 
 Got my weapon cocked in 
 It's not even in the spot I'm supposed to 
 Have it locked in 
 Caddy that I'm dropping 
 Make you erase your top 10 
 That's it if we talking cars or broads 
 Whatever, I got options

 Wanna be a baller 
 Shot caller 
 20 inch blades on a impala 
 That's how we ride 
 Soutside we roll on choppers 
 Top notch hoes get the most not the 
 Lesser 
 25 lighters on my dresser 
 Southside south side man 
 Talkin' bout diamonds in your face 
 Now what the hell you meaning trick? 
 Texas too legit 
 Plus I got my hammer case a jacker 
 Wanna trip 
 Leaning on a switch 
 Seated on the stitch 
 Hit that waffle house you completed 
 With the grits 
 Yella think she slick 
 Gota be that magnum 
 Horses under the hood or maybe on the 
 Range like Jazzy an them 
 Snitches just be tadelin 
 Mad because we slabbin em 
 When you super cold it ain't nothing you 
 Can add to them 
 I be rolling...
