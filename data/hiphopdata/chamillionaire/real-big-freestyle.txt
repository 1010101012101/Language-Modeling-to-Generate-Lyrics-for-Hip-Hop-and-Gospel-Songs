Stay in the house a bit, don't come out of it 
 'Bout me? niggas best not be announcin it 
 Like ya mouth real big, neva doubt the kid 
 What I spit is legit real niggas vouch for it 
 They say ouch you're sick, I say... I'm sick? 
 After what I did man the swisha house is sick 
 Dike jones pussy nigga that they vouched for picked 
 The wrong nigga to mess with but I caught that trick 
 I had to show 'em how I do it 
 Now they listenin to the music and they say that I'm the truest 
 But I knew it they was foolish, they was actin' kinda clueless 
 Why you lookin' at my diamonds and actin' like they cubics 
 Talkin' like ya bulletproof, niggas actin' like they suited 
 So I dropped mix tape messiah right after that they rooted 
 For the mix tape god, they actin' like I'm buddhist 
 Got 'em praisin my phrase, I just rap and they salute it 
 (Attention) now hang it up like a hanger 
 Send it to the m.i.a. and this'll be another banger 
 Real niggas don't snitch, I won't be the one to name ya 
 Laws come around here and I won't be the one to blame ya 
 (Uh uh) I shouldn't be an entertainer 
 It wont be the index, its gon be anotha finger 
 That I hold up to the camera, I ain't gon be no complainer 
 If its drama that you came for you gon be anotha stranger
