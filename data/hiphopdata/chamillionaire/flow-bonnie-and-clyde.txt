Hold up man 
 Watch me come down 
 And do my thang 
 Watch me swang wide 
 While my ride change 
 Groupies it ain't a thang 
 We switchin and grippin grain 
 And getting the money man 
 And my name is chamillinaire 
 And I ride swangs 
 From shreveport little rock 
 To taliman 
 Groupies it ain't a thang 
 We switchin and grippin grain 
 And lovin' the money 
 I show her off to the groupies 
 Let the know she's in my life 
 When I billionaire I let a foreinger be my wife 
 It's a period every month 
 When I don't get to touch her 
 But after four or five days of sober fiendin will clutch her 
 Scremin to bust nut 
 Please don't be a nut 
 'Cause only a nut 
 Would try to put his hands on my slut 
 A lot of guys with her 
 But them other guys don't matter
