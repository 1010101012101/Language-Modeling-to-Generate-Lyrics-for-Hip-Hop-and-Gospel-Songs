Welcome to the South 
 Try to criticize us for how we live 
 They gon' do the same things that we just did 
 Betta watch your mouth 
 Try to criticize us for how we spit 
 Then say you respect the money that we get 
 Welcome to the south 
 Watch 'em criticize everything we did 
 And expect that us to never even trip 
 We know them grills and candy paint 
 So be careful what you say 
 'Cause we might just throw it right back in your face 
 Betta watch your mouth 
 Uh I cross the globe 
 I hit a hater 
 Same whispers from state to state 
 If you didn't say then this ain't for you 
 Don't worry 'bout it 'Cause you can't relate 
 Before you buy me then you criticize me 
 While you beside me 
 Let's get it straight 
 'Cause you remind me of the kid beside me 
 Same rapper that you say you hate 
 Wanna criticize then fine 
 Say the south got simple rhymes 
 Every time I travel I'm in the backyard that act just like mine 
 Same rhyme just different times 
 I don't think that it changed a lil' 
 Used to show our grills and they be like eww 
 Nowadays they all say that's ill 
 I remember when the major label 
 Wouldn't even come pay a visit 
 Used to say they had love for us but 
 They just blowin' them suspect kisses 
 Now you watchin' me see you plottin' me 
 Can't act like we ain't suspicious 
 Shoot the slugs you shoot at us but when you bust your thang it misses, uh 
 I ain't leavin' much trippin' 
 'Cause I'm a man where I'm residing 
 I'm decidin' where I'm residing 
 Should never tolerate domestic violence 
 I know you'd rather me just relax and sit back in silence 
 But I'm the owner not just the client 
 Shit the south is where I stay at

 Betta watch your mouth 
 Don't knock the swagga, don't knock the swagga 
 Then turn around and be a swagger jacker 
 You a man and you should be a man 
 Don't walk around without an Adam's apple 
 We was lookin' at it from a distance 
 But we wasn't trippin' 'cause it had to happen 
 Styrophone cup and a snapla, you actin' like you been a fan of rappers 
 You was hatin' or participatin' when you saw sub anuba slidin' through 
 You and everybody else that did it, they applauded them and they applauded you 
 You actin' like somebody made ya say it 
 Took your hand and then applied the glue 
 Turn around and give the mic to you 
 And now you end up lookin' like a fool 
 Can't holla ya, some followers 
 And that's the reason I'm in the lead 
 The rest of y'all are some bench warmers and gettin' mad 'cause I'm in the lead 
 I'm switchin' speeds, don't get fatigued 
 Y'all behind in line, y'all chasin' me 
 Y'all finna see my energy, so get off my back and let a playa breathe 
 I won't lie and act like I'm the one supportin everything 
 Like southern rappers ain't never lame 
 Like some of these boys don't eff up the game 
 Most of us do our thang 
 And the rest of 'em leave my ears in pain 
 But that's him and he sure ain't me 
 So don't look at us like we all the same

 Pimp C 
 South side candy rider 
 Never been a socializer 
 Flyin' high, work grinder, knock ya gal you can't find her 
 She was sittin' on butter 
 Hundred thousand under her ass 
 I was workin' the wood, circle smokin' candy mashin' on the gas 
 I can't be you, I can't do you 
 I just do me, if you ain't 
 Been where I been then you can't 
 Be who I be if you ain't 
 Seen what I see and you can't see what I see 
 I put the bricks in the rolla with slabs on that wasn't free 
 Been a legend in the south since the year '93 
 Pocket full of stones, menace to society 
 The heart in the car chrome and folds, not B's 
 Now everybody pimpin' and they all got keys 
 Nigga please, you work for UPS 
 They say they smokin' dro but all I keep smellin' is stress 
 I roll with the best 
 92 million screwin' the Lexus 
 I might not be nothin' to you 
 But I'm the shit in that Texas 
 Welcome to the South...
