(Feat. Chalie Boy) 
 Chalie Boy: 
 Everybody Know My Name 
 (Uh Chamillitary Mayne) 
 Knockin' bitch niggas out the flame 
 Mayne 
 Lil mama I'm fly (I'm fly) 
 I'm throwed (I'm throwed) 
 Ya ain't seen a playa like me befo' 
 Real niggas recognize, that bitch is (?) 
 I trap twenty minutes hit the mall and brought a shop 
 Lil buddy I'm row (I'm row) 
 I show ass (I show ass) 
 Got a lot of toys cause a nigga play with cash 
 Swangs drops on glass, truck got beat 
 Fuck a strip club I make it rain in the street 
 No bumping, 'cause I'm packing 
 Ridin' 4's till them hoes start clacking 
 Police try jack ya I show ya what's happening 
 This one season and my whole squad trapping 
 Blessed outta made it, dressing the ladies 
 Question all the haters they claiming that they the greatest 
 Reading two slow you ain't on the same pages 
 Step ya game up, cause your boys OUTRAGEOUS! 
 Breaking out CAGES, stacking big faces 
 Straight, we ain't call em, all you losers disgraces 
 Tighten up your lace and poppin' bottles by the cases 
 Rollin' hard jaw liken like I got braces 
 Mayne 
 Chamillionaire: 
 I'm fly (I'm fly) 
 I'm throwed (I'm throwed) 
 I'm coming down on a set of new 4's 
 Grippin' that oak with my Diamonds Exposed 
 Back in the streets I'm in Underground Mode 
 Mayne 
 Kill a career with a verse, I show up at the funeral 
 Trunk poppin' my beat knockin' yeah D.T.P. in like Luda do 
 Better have my money baby, cash would be what suitable 
 Cause yo head is like the top that's on my drop removable 
 My naked lady she a clown but they say jackers try'na find her 
 I pull out that ragged shiner now my lady looking finer 
 Underground we gotta eat, let me take you to the diner 
 Paint syrup that's Aunt Jemima it's like she my new desinger 
 I got doe but it's a curse, get girls but money worse 
 They say you can't take it with'cha so I put a safe in a herse 
 Candy skirt goin' make 'em hurt, man I better go get the work 
 I swang down my driveway and then I "ERR" and hit reverse 
 Koopa, yep I'm still the man, still the man that a still the man 
 I still the man like the Estella's fan and you out of bounds like you Moreno Dan 
 I be getting that green baby, boy seems like they mad at that 
 Every time I grab a stack I'll look just like a Cabbage Patch
