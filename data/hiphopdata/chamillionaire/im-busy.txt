I know you're trying to see me 
 But I'm kinda busy 
 She telling me, she like my song 
 (She said she like my song) 
 She said she got nothing on 
 But heels and a striped thong 
 Girl, I think it's time to bone 
 (Girl, I think it's time to bone) 
 Bring the Screwed up CD 
 'Cause this time is easy 
 To stop hiding behind your phone 
 (Stop hiding behind your phone) 
 That's what lil' mama told me 
 So you already know 
 That a playa 'bout to bone 
 (That a playa 'bout to bone) 
 Yeah, got a girl in Dallas, she love Pappa though 
 She be calling me up, Koopa let's eat 
 Sorry, but I got a radio interview to do 
 I gotta hook up with Milla Mack and Greg Street 
 Maybe we can retreat to get a bite to eat 
 Take a night to sneak to a tightless suite 
 You can invite some freaks but get it right, I'm cheap 
 I won't pay you could leave, with tonight's receipt 
 I'm in Alabama or Louisiana 
 Ke'Noe and Dobey, BeBe and Jabber 
 When I'm not in the lab, you know I'm trying to grab a 
 Couple G's chick please, what are you getting mad for 
 I'm in Atlanta in the morning 
 When I hook up with Killa Mike, Lil' Jon and them 
 All of my calls, I'm gonna forward them 
 To the answer machine, please call again, I'm busy 
 Sorry, you didn't reach me 
 Just the answer machine 
 Sorry, I'm not by the phone 
 But you know that I'm gone 
 Call you when I get home 
 Leave a message after the tone 
 (Leave a message after the tone)
