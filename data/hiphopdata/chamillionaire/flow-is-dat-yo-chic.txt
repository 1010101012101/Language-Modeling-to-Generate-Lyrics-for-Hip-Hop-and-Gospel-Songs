 (DJ Drama Talking) 
 That was a hot freestlye but now we 
 Got tha illest coming up the official 
 King koopa changing color lizard he is 
 A rap god you know who I'm 
 Talking about... 
 (Chamillonaire) 
 You know that feelin' you get when you in love, what do ya call it? 
 I don't know but I only feel like that when I open my wallet 
 Wanna be hard... retards actin' like they ain't fraud 
 Open ya mouth so I can drag ya feet and cut my yard 
 Broke niggaz always tryna tell ya how to get a dollar 
 Shut up when the heat holla, run hollow tips follow 
 Like prank callers... y'all niggaz need to hang it up 
 No Biggie, I'll take his Shyne like ya nickname was Puff 
 Ay, controversy sells... and I know I was wrong 
 But you bia bia's need to listen to that Lil' Jon song 
 This ain't no sisqo thong song, we the voice of the streets 
 So in order to keep the peace, gotta keep a piece 
 Just kiddin', don't touch guns, guns will kill 
 And that's real, when you still use ya dumb tongue to squill 
 Don't get mad, don't take everything seriously 
 But if ya rappin' and lookin' for a rapper to fear, it's me 
 Chamillion the Mixtape Messiah, get duct-taped and tie ya 
 To the table, open ya mouth and make ya eat barbed wire 
 Sandwich, man this boy got to be signed 
 If he's not, then Russell want me to sign his dotted-line 
 Nope, maybe next bitch ass niggq, underground I'm found 
 Sharks swimmin' in the dark, ya talk down now drown 
 So I'ma continue, to rule move get out the way 
 While the chrome metal 'copter blades keep spinnin' for days 
 The block gets... bled red like a leg in a ant bed 
 My twanks make a crippled girl turn her damn head 
 Hakim' cause a scene when I drop my screens 
 Got more green then mean green sippin' a green cup of lean 
 In a green limousine, I impress myself 
 Might spit game to a nun just to test myself 
 Won't pour up a fourth 
 Sho' I'll throw up the fourth 
 Fa'sho I'll show up to four 
 And bleeh blow up the show 
 Whoa!, ice bright man 
 Like a night-light man 
 Ice white like the head-lights on a white van 
 As bright as a white man 
 With a light tan 
 Ice bright as the skin on Michael Jackson's right hand, nigga 
 Goddamn oh! I impress myself 
 I'm so throwed I need a catchers mit to catch myself 
 How much you niggaz wanna bet you'll never get my wealth 
 I'll rather play a solo game of dice and bet myself 
 Whoa hold up Ron C I just won me a G 
 Lucky me I'm the nigga that wannabe's wannabe 
 I'm tellin' ya, oh nigga I impress myself 
 So many hoes on my dick I gotta stretch my belt 
 Nigga ya better go handcuff ya honey dip quick 
 My lips don' touched mo' female lips then lipstick 
 My car got more butter then a bunch of biscuits 
 I get chicks while you get dissed and get dismissed 
 I get kissed like I was under missile toe on christmas 
 Paul Wall don' got diamonds imported on his kicks 
 Ron C is using platinum turntables for this mix 
 I walk around with a chain that's bigger then slick ricks 
 Warfare and lick 6 we never ride bareford 
 Ride Ac or Jag or maybe a black ford 
 Ridin' round with a gat on the damn dashboard 
 Oh No!, sab war comin' in through the backdoor 
 Fuck dem whores you know how we get down oh no!
