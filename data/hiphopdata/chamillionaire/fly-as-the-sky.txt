(Chorus: Chamillionaire) 
 If what you heard me, See me in person. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 Even your girlfriends and all her girlfriends. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm fly.

 Keep it dirty, dirty you heard me. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm Fly As The Sky. 
 Fly like a birdy. 
 Fly like a birdy. 
 Fly like a... 
 Chamillionaire: 
 Yellow band, excuse me Cham, please give me the time again 
 Diamonds so large, the minute hand ain't got no time for them 
 Damn! How you susposed to see the time when them. 
 M&M-sized diamonds lay right beside the hand 
 Chamilll, Rasaq, & Lil' Wayne make a nigga feel ashamed 
 Tryin' to hide the bling in the middle of your little chain 
 In the drain, down it go, say they love the sound of those 
 Chamilltary boys, We the illest boys around here hoe 
 Flyer than a bird yes but your correct if your guess 
 Is that the eagle gonna hurt when aimin' at your bare chest 
 Pow! Forget your feelings, I could care less 
 Leave you where I leave you, you can see ya in the turbulence 
 Girl do yourself a favor and don't say I have to pay ya 
 Give a favor to a player and just pass it to my neighbor 
 And when your finished could you tell your friend to flavor 
 'Cause the king ain't gonna savor, just gonna save that ass for later. 
 (Chorus: Chamillionaire) 
 If what you heard me, See me in person. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 Even your girlfriends and all her girlfriends. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm fly.

 Keep it dirty, dirty you heard me. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm Fly As The Sky. 
 Fly like a birdy. 
 Fly like a birdy. 
 Fly like a... 
 Rasaq: 
 Mayne I'm fly as a plane, Me and Lil' Wayne 
 Spittin' game, get your girl weezy like his name 
 We don't have to say a thing 'cause the chain can explain 
 First they look at the piece then they look at the rang 
 I'm fly as a pelican, Ice on my skeleton 
 On a Sunday morning, I stay sharper than a reverend 
 Candy on my doors, lookin' something like gelatin 
 Syrup in my cup but I ain't talkin' about medicine 
 I'm cold as an eskimo, throwed from my head to toe 
 The white tee fresh but it starts in my denims though 
 Yeah and if I pull down my fly, I could piss on the sky 
 'Cause nigga I'm that high 
 I pulled up in heaven up in the candy painted ride 
 And I gave Jesus 5 & I'm still alive 
 Even though I know them haters wish I would die 
 Even in they day dreams, I'm a still stay fly boy. 
 (Chorus: Chamillionaire) 
 If what you heard me, See me in person. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 Even your girlfriends and all her girlfriends. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 Keep it dirty, dirty you heard me. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm Fly As The Sky. 
 Fly like a birdy. 
 Fly like a birdy. 
 Fly like a... 
 Lil' Wayne: 
 They call me Birdman Jr. I'm flyer than the rest 
 I'm tryin' to get a couple cool pigeons to the nest 
 And if you look at how the jewels glisten on my chest 
 Then you will be impressed and yes that's VS 
 Fly boy to death, I used to only fly 
 First class on every plane till I bought a jet 
 I'm on the runway, let down the steps 
 Open the phantom door and light up the cess 
 I smoke the best, Chamillion come get me 
 From University of Houston after I pass my test 
 Swisha lays for sure, it'll come your nerves 
 So boy I'm so high, I could palm the world 
 Yeah & I'm strapped for the turbulence 
 Pow! Now you up here with me in a cloud (Chea) 
 They call me Weezy Baby, the son of a stunner 
 Bitch I'm flyer than a muthafucker, you know. 
 (Chorus: Chamillionaire) 
 If what you heard me, See me in person. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 Even your girlfriends and all her girlfriends. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 Keep it dirty, dirty you heard me. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm fly. 
 You know I'm Fly As The Sky. 
 Fly like a birdy. 
 Fly like a birdy. 
 Fly like a... 
 Chamillionaire: 
 Poster child to the pop trunk, I pop it up and let it bang 
 I'm show you how to rep the city, correctly run the game 
 Grip tightly on the grain, turn it left and we call it swang 
 Let me show you how to make the baddest ladies scream your name 
 I'll put that boy J Jr. in the future in a body bag 
 I'm tryin' to quote that bad body like a boxing bag 
 Tryin' to get below the belt and beat it like a boxing jab 
 Hit it then I quit it like I dropped out of a boxing class 
 Know how we doin' it, we been chopped and screwin' it 
 Comin' to get that #1 spot you got like Ludacris 
 Know he actin' groupy-ish takin' a sip out Luda's Cris 
 We buy our own bottles, grab one and put it to your lips 
 Hatin' on your hood, throw your hood up, put it in his face 
 Reppin' Texas, got that real estate down in that realest state 
 Didn't need a bigger place, didn't need a bigger face 
 On my watch but forgot and went a got them both a place 
 Fix your face.
