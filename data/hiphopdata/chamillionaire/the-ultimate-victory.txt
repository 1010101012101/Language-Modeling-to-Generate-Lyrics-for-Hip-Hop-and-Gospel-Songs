I'ma keep winnin' with the album almost through, 
 Thanks I ain't neva had a fan like you, 
 Eazy-E Left Eye and Aaliyah too, 
 Pac Biggie Hawk Fat Pat and DJ Screw, 
 I wanna thank you 
 Talking: 
 Thanks for openin' my eyes, 
 And helpin' to me to realize that tomorrow ain't promised, 
 Gotta live life to the fullest, 
 What's life if you ain't enjoyin' it, 
 Know'm talkin' bout'? 
 My purpose really used to be so unclear, 
 Science fiction with the swagger it's so unreal, 
 So fly that my nickname should be up here, 
 Lookin' up is the only time when I appear, 
 I'm a spartan, go ahead and throw your spear, 
 Slap failure in the face and still show no fear, 
 They say no show but I show like yeah, (The champs here) 
 But the whole crowd know my cheer, (Victory) 
 The media they write about you in the mass, 
 Spread rumors bout ya life and break you is the task, 
 I know one of my three publicists would ruin my chance, 
 So let me let you know, that I don't like you in advance but I, (Thank you) 
 And I extend their thanks too, 
 To everybody sayin' stuff, you know ain't true, 
 You need to go and find God like Mase too, 
 And just stay there with him and try to stay you, 
 Gettin' away is important, 
 I could pull a couple strings like a guitar hand, 
 Better yet, bring out the whole guitar band, 
 Grab green, we could swing somewhere like Tarzan, 
 I swear to y'all the rap game, really makin' me sick, 
 The record industry's your home, then I came to evict, 
 Put some nonsense out and I bet you this one'll stick, 
 I put real music out and I'm probably gon' catch a brick, 
 Brick, on top of brick, will build a house, 
 Tell whoever said that, I'm still filled with doubt, 
 Told me I'm in the right hole and then sealed it out, 
 Told me I'm on the right track and then killed my route, (Ouch!) 
 You never miss a good thing till it's gone, 
 Yeah the flow is so fluid, it's like drinkin' a song, (Don't get the track listing wrong) 
 This ain't even a song, (Now what it is?) 
 This is a beat, that I must release therapy on, 
 Everybody sayin' that they wanna see me (Successful), 
 Came into the game, but now I'm feelin' like (Let's go), 
 Intimate moments never seem to be special, 
 See the jet, you can bet, I'm disappearin' like presto, 
 Alakazam, I ain't mad at the fans, 
 I ain't mad at the man, 
 They both scattered my brand, 
 Never would understand, 
 What really matters to Cham, 
 So matter of fact the title is just a matter of plan, (Victory) 
 After revenge it's the Victory right?, 
 Well the final runs done and it's the Victory hype, 
 Now that everybody's present and it's Victory night, 
 Let me re-paint the pic, they wasn't depictin' me right, (Now what you mean?) 
 Tell the world that I'm more than just a grill, 
 Show ya how to put your hands, on more than a wood wheel, 
 If that's all your hearin', then let me just be for real, 
 Take your contract, to hell with a record deal, 
 Keep thinkin' I'ma lose if you want to, 
 Been through 10 times, more in life than you've gone through, 
 That's why, I always have to make the move on fools, 
 Back on my feet, like I got 2 gum shoes, 
 Yeah, why you think Em probably goin' all crazy, 
 And why you think Britney Spears goin' bald baby, 
 Interview me, you think you know it all lady, 
 I'm outta here, (yeah) but not before y'all pay me, (Thank you) 
 Talking: 
 I appreciate it, 
 You know I'ma use the power of respect, 
 And a million dollar check to do what I wanna do, 
 Right now, 
 I'm finna take a vacation, 
 A real vacation though, (Ha ha) 
 This the outro, was gon' put it at the beginnin', 
 But this is what I say the moment after I'm winnin', 
 Thank you 
 Ultimate Victory
