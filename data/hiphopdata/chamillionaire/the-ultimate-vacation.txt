Get away, Get away (hey) 
 You got to have a passport if you're rollin' with me 
 We can hit Jamaica or we can chill in France 
 Roll with a playa, you can bring a friend (ya) 
 You in the presence of some playas, Chamillitary do it big 
 We could hit hawaii or the Caribbean, 
 We could do it major, chillin' on the sand 
 You stressin' everyday, 'cause the way that you're livin' 
 See it in your face, ain't no fakin' the feelin' 
 We can get away -ay -ay and be chillin' 
 We can get away -ay -ay and be chillin' 
 We can go today, and get away for a minute 
 Party everyday, do your thing to the rhythm 
 We can get away -ay -ay, get away 
 We can get away -ay -ay and be chillin' 
 Ay, I got money, got paper, 
 Ay, I got plenty of cheddar (plenty of cheddar) 
 So we treatin', today like we know it ain't lastin' forever 
 Hey, now bartender, remember 
 To bring the straw with the umbrella (please bring the umbrella) 
 Hey, we just drinkin', and thinkin', 
 Of a way that we can make life better 
 Ya! Coconut with the umbrella baby 
 And the Rhianna Soundin chick is the umbrella lady 
 It ain't no carpet on the floor like they renovating 
 Palm trees like my old homeboys, hella shady 
 Time flies so you know the clock is passin' through 
 Hit the sand is the only other task to do 
 You know my fanbase is international 
 Their fanbase is only within an avenue (Ugh!) 
 Go wherever that you plan 
 G5 I'll show 'em how to fly like Peter Pan 
 Get a lobster or anything that she demand 
 If it isn't then it's somethin' you will never eat again 
 Step off the yacht if you wanna see the land 
 I'll take you to the sun if you really need a tan 
 Water look like oxygen anywhere you stand 
 'Cause the ocean so clear you look down and see the sand 
 You stressin' everyday, 'cause the way that you're livin' 
 See it in your face, ain't no fakin' the feelin' 
 We can get away -ay -ay and be chillin' 
 We can get away -ay -ay and be chillin' 
 We can go today, and get away for a minute 
 Party everyday, do your thing to the rhythm 
 We can get away -ay -ay, get away 
 We can get away -ay -ay and be chillin' 
 Listen, if money talks, my paper probly speak Greek 
 I'm in a different continent like each week 
 Seein' daylight and they gon probly be sleep 
 No cell phones, send a telegram to East Beach 
 Females, it's like ya chick is so hot to me 
 Can we all chill, I turn maybe into possibly 
 You know my beach house is what you got to see 
 Paper and property, walkin' game of Monopoly 
 My helicopter lands on the boardwalk 
 Where the residents ain't understandin' your talk 
 The cliff ends and the salt water pours off 
 Think what you think, but you'll never have a bored thought 
 Water so warm that the fishes isn't cold 
 And the air is so open that the pigeons get exposed 
 Didn't I remind you to bring your swimmin' clothes 
 No, I didn't on purpose, now you're swimmin' in your Whoa! 
 Ay, I got money, got paper, 
 Ay, I got plenty of cheddar (plenty of cheddar) 
 So we treatin', today like we know it ain't lastin' forever 
 Hey, now bartender, remember 
 To bring the straw with the umbrella (please bring the umbrella) 
 Hey, we just drinkin', and thinkin', 
 Of a way that we can make life better 
 It's all good, long as you don't turn on me like a doorknob 
 And try to make my flow stop like a cork does 
 Now we'll be in Hawaii eatin' corn cob 
 Pinnin' a flower in your hair like a corsage 
 Said I shouldn't leave, but you know I ain't hear a thing 
 10 karat earring blockin' all my hearing 
 Never go back is exactly what they're fearing 
 Know plenty Jamaicans so I brought you to the real ting 
 Rude Boy! Sick wit it and givin' flu 
 It's like I just appeared here, but I really flew 
 They say it just to rhyme, this what I really do 
 Deja-Vu, we'll repeat it when the year is through 
 You stressin' everyday, 'cause the way that you're livin' 
 See it in your face, ain't no fakin' the feelin' 
 We can get away -ay -ay and be chillin' 
 We can get away -ay -ay and be chillin' 
 We can go today, and get away for a minute 
 Party everyday, do your thing to the rhythm 
 We can get away -ay -ay, get away 
 We can get away -ay -ay and be chillin'
