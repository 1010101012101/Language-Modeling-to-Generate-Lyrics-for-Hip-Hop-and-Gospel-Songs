I'm the best 
 Beef is something you should expect 
 Because the rest 
 Would break they neck 
 To be as good as the best 
 And its obvious I'm the best 
 So I'm looking for less 
 And friends 
 On just pretend 
 Only looking 4 checks 
 Say hello to the villain 
 I would say its nice to meet you 
 But It's not so I don't pretend it is wen I greet you 
 Same niggaz that run wit you tryin' to beat you 
 So I chase money like the payment that's on the lease due 
 Give me that Give me Give me that 
 See That 
 That's why the wallet fatter then a city rat 
 Feelin' that 
 Till its really really fat 
 You hungry tryin' to eat niggaz tryin' to give you snacks 
 We ain't havin' that 
 You feelin' me 
 Yeah the only drama that ain't compared 
 And I'm feelin' they scared 
 So go tell them a said 
 Imma make a killin' this year 
 Heading all the way to the top like it ain't a ceilin' in here 
 Mixtape messiah 1 don't act like you ain't hear that joint 
 I'm like young buck wit a knife niggaz gone get my point 
 So point the hater out 
 Who say that I ain't about 
 What ever I say I'm bout 
 That doubt 
 I'm gone fade them out 
 And till class number 1 
 Number 1 less son 
 Never turn a 1 on 1 
 To a 1 on guns 
 If its more then 1 
 And you notice 1 more come 
 Make him shut his mouth like a nun 
 Who don't want no tongue 
 And he's done 
 I rock from home to home 
 To having phone sex 
 I ain't trying 2 bone the phone 
 I'm tryin' 2 get up in the yellow bones chrome a zones 
 Turn an empty garage in a home to a chrome and zone 
 Park up in it 
 I just got a minute 
 When I spot the kitten 
 Man I'm about to hit it yeah 
 I told him I had it lock but they didn't believe me 
 Now they sayin' "THAT'S RIGHT" like Young Jeezy 
 Ha Ha you better get up in a nigga face 
 Get up in a nigga face 
 Rid him of his dinner plates 
 They ain't eatin' like we eatin' 
 That's why niggaz gotta hate 
 Delegate a weapon that will leave him wit the Nelly face 
 Band-aid on it 
 First aid pass it 
 Tellin' you they sendin' you a medical that's it 
 Forget a throwback hardwood classic 
 Lay you on your back on the hardwood ass kick 
 Looking for Koopa don't look for me by your lonely 
 Cause homie 
 I keep it on me 
 That's only 
 To keep the fonies 
 Layin' off any place 
 Not my face 
 Cause niggaz don't want me to make the cake 
 Pee like the homie 
 Except for sony 
 It's the don 
 Wit the fond's 
 Nigga fits your grind 
 I show your green lights pimpin' outfits was mine 
 And Slim Thugga my boy so I can switch his line 
 Forget cars tell MTV to pimp your rhymes 
 Smack DVD
