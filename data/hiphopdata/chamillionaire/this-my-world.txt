A different city every night right 
 And they be going so insane 
 I'm repping for my city right, right 
 So you should be happy that I came 
 You wouldn't believe it, if you seen me 
 I watch the skyline light up every evening 
 It's like I'm dreaming baby, what I mean is 
 Most of y'all don't know really 'cause 
 This my World, whoa 
 This my World, whoa 
 This my World, whoa 
 Off the chain 
 (Chamillionaire) 
 I don't worry 'bout paper I past up 
 I focus on money my hands touch 
 If that right there don't add up 
 I gotta let you know your math sucks 
 You don't ever talk to a calculator 
 You don't get caught with an ounce of paper 
 Every convo is about a favour 
 Had to get a mansion without the neighbours 
 I ain't meaning no bad shit 
 When I say they don't have a dime 
 And I ain't meaning no Gold watch when I say "I don't have the time" 
 My hustle is the reason why I'm known to shine 
 It's like I'm in my own World 
 Cause these boys out here pillow talking 
 And texting all my old girls 
 You call that your homegirl 
 I call that my dome girl 
 I call that my errr, 
 I'm not home leave a message after the tone girl 
 I go to places they rap about 
 But girls only love you cause the cash you got 
 See all these hoes is chasing stars 
 Growing up to be cashtronauts 
 Can't get mad, I asked for it 
 Living life in that airport 
 Y'all ain't even get off the ground 
 Y'all stuck in that chair-port 
 I know they wanna see my cash short 
 But only thing I ask Lord 
 Is please don't let me run out of nothing but pages in my passport 
 You wouldn't believe it, if you seen me 
 I watch the skyline light up every evening 
 It's like I'm dreaming baby, what I mean is 
 Most of y'all don't know really 'cause 
 This my World, whoa 
 This my World, whoa 
 This my World, whoa 
 Off the chain 
 (Big K.R.I.T - Verse 2) 
 Been through a lot just to get this far 
 Whip that car, grip that grain 
 Ready pipes on the lights 
 Went from broke, to having things 
 Catching planes out of state 
 I got dudes to pay, I got moves to make 
 F-ck the fee, that they put on me 
 To keep the lights on and food on their plate 
 Hit the slab, push it to the max 
 Expensive taste, I love poppin' tags 
 F-cking hoes, I live in the lab 
 Spittin' bars that reflect my past 
 What you know 'bout sold out shows 
 More country sh-t everywhere I go 
 Putting on for the third coast 
 Sippin' lean, give a damn, what you think of them before 
 Nothin' else I gave them hope 
 If they could follow dreams of their own 
 Be successful and ride clean with the chrome 
 If it ain't past shawty leave it alone 
 And you know they hate and preach their Lord 
 Most n-ggas talk now just because 
 I'm putting my faith in the man above 
 About my bread, playa be about your's 
 Be 'bout our's, stay on course 
 I make my mark everywhere I go 
 I speak that trill every time I flow 
 I get my own, 'cause it's everywhere I know 
 That's all I show so when I toast to the life I live 
 I'm taking off like a laser beam 
 Rather not wake, gotta get my cake up 
 While I'm out here living the dream 
 This my world! 
 You wouldn't believe it, if you seen me 
 I watch the skyline light up every evening 
 It's like I'm dreaming baby, what I mean is 
 Most of y'all don't know really 'cause 
 This my World, whoa 
 This my World, whoa 
 This my World, whoa 
 Off the chain 
 A different city every night right 
 And they be going so insane 
 I repping for my city right, right 
 So you should be happy that I came 
 She say she want to spend the night right 
 And I don't even know her name 
 (Don't even know your name) 
 Just sit and watch me as I fly high 
 And she wanna be my Lois Lane 
 (Chamillionaire - Verse 3) 
 Fresh off the plane, straight to the Rover 
 I can't complain, tip for the chauffeur 
 When I hit my room, it's over 
 Floor that I'm on, high as a toca 
 Funny thing is this girl is sober 
 But she gon be drunk before she hit the sofa 
 You stay the night if you acting right 
 The views that we looking at that's a sight 
 You really be living that rapper life 
 It they ain't made it where I'm at than they ain't rapping right 
 She me and KRIT got dough appetites 
 You couldn't see us if with a flashing light 
 See you could die, than come back to life 
 And still couldn't see us in the after life 
 And you know... 
 We believe in, if you see me 
 I watch the skyline light up every evening 
 It's like I'm dreaming baby, what I mean is 
 Most of y'all don't know really 'cause 
 This my World, whoa 
 This my World, whoa 
 This my World, whoa 
 (It's like I'm dreaming, It's like I'm dreaming) 
 This my World, whoa 
 Off the chain 
 Dollar to my name, quarter in my jeans 
 Million dollar vision now I'm living out my dreams 
 It's my World, It's my world 
 I had a dollar to my name, quarter in my jeans 
 Million dollar vision now I'm living out my dreams 
 It's my World, It's my world 
 It's my World, yeah
