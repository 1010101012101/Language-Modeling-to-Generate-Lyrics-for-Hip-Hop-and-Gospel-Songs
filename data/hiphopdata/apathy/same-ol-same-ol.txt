(Apathy) 
 Downstairs on the first floor, first door on the right 
 Name is Mr. White, drinks all night and beats his wife 
 But she never-ever leaves, she believes he's right 
 And it's probably her fault when they get into a fight 
 Locks himself in the bathroom and twiddles his balls 
 Peeking through a little hole that he drilled in the wall 
 Hidden underneath a picture of Jesus inwitnesses the neighbors teenager nieces 
 Named Marira and Lisa 
 Gettin' dressed, sneaking boys, in the room for sex 
 It upsets him but excites him, none the less 
 The girls used to live with they dad who had a coke addiction 
 He was broke from the blow plus the alcoholism 
 So they moved with they uncle and aunt 
 Wasn't what they want, but they couldn't front, they would get away with a lot 
 Fuckin' with an older kid who live across the hall 
 Who would buy them alcohol and drive them to the mall 
 That's Steven, his mother's insane and thinks demons are screaming inside of brain 
 So she eases the pain with painkillers 
 Telling everybody she's religious 
 She's not sure, but thinks Mr. White's here to kill us 
 And all day long doors open doors shut 
 No idea how much the others are fucked up 
 They smile when they pass, maybe say hello 
 Everywhere, every town, same ol' same ol'
