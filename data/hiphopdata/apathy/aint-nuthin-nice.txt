(Apathy) 
 Yo, This is Apathy of the Demigodz 
 Comin' for all you punk motherfuckers... 
 It Ain't Nothin' Nice Celph Titled 
 I'm Undefeatable, Biggie would even say I'm unbelievable 
 Plus quick to flip like Sport Utility Vehicles 
 I crush years, so don't ever come near, 
 Cause it was done from the beginning like Father MC's career 
 A new title holder is here this year 
 Ap's raps got more pussies open than pap smears 
 The nicest emcee, you'll never dispute 
 'Cause I've been rappin' since the tree on your Timb boots was roots 
 I knock more boots than 40 deuce prostitutes 
 But not for loot, only if she's hot and cute 
 Try and cock block my game it's complete violation 
 Cause Apathy's got more hoes/hose than firestations 
 I face off with imitators and take off 
 Bring more flavor to the beef than steak sauce 
 You think your phatter than Apathy, but you way off, 
 You're soft, and you've done more weight loss than Kate Moss 
 Chorus: repeat 4X 
 Let me tell you about my only vice 
 It has to do with rockin' mics and it ain't nothin' nice 
 (Apathy) 
 Your shit's finito, I wrap up beef like a burrito 
 Underground flow, down low, incognito 
 The torpedo, that tore flows, that tore shows, 
 Through tore clothes, before blows, through torsos, 
 It's Apathy, so large my physical mass occupies 
 Multiple galaxies like god off calories 
 I cock back, rock raps for dickriders, 
 My mic is something you should never pick up like hitchhikers 
 Above average, y'all better practice 
 Even weak emcee's consider you the wackest 
 I heard your debut joint, your song ain't hot 
 Its something that a crackhead would pawn for rock 
 I got bombs, with glocks on lock to blow spots 
 My flow clocks the speed of mach and won't stop 
 You got a lot of hype, but I know you're a flop 
 Nothin's really gonna happen, like when the ball drops 
 You all stop, you all pussy clot, 
 Mushy as when a cookie drops in milk 
 I pop like when rookie cops with glocks and felt nervous at first 
 But the verses reverses, the guilt from the suckers I killed 
 I cop green, last and burn like hot steam 
 Spit one rhyme and destroy the pop scene 
 You cum too quick like a teen with hot dreams 
 You wack, while I crack more heads than rock fiends 
 (Apathy) 
 I hold power like Imhotep controls magic 
 Spin old jazz wax, and spit over static 
 I want hip hop to come back and make classics 
 Nas should spit it like he did for Illmatic 
 My raps add up, like numbers in mathmatics 
 I got more tracks than arms of crack addicts 
 My wax acts like an axe hackin up faggots 
 I'm fly, like the adult stage of maggots 
 Apathy is the illest on mics it's like a habit, 
 Even ask Ed O.G. "I Got to Have It" 
 ????????????????????????????, 
 I bubble your mouth full, like South Pole jackets 
 It's tragic, why you even mess with this rap shit 
 Nobody wants to fuck with you like busted fat chicks 
 Ya clips ain't full, when you pull your gat clips 
 Now how you gonna battle this, spittin' that wack shit 
 Demigodz, Apathy, we on the cut, you know the deal 
 My man Unknown on the ones and twos 
 Y'all suckas can lose, 
 There is no competition, y'all know how we do 
 It ain't nothin' nice
