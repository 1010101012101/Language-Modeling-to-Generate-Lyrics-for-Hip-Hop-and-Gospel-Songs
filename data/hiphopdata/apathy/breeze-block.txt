Celph titled: 
 YO... I hold rappers hostage, spit saliva that's toxic, from the NYC to the FLA tropics 
 AR15 schitzo, make your chest blow, nothing to say like Greg Nice without the echo, I'm a cross between c4 and c3po 
 Explosive intelligence, pack the heavy metal, out the window 
 With the demo you tried to sell me, I'd rather listen to a broad based comeback LP, it's not healthy 
 For you to come around here with that, run your mouth off like that, and get your wig pushed back like that 
 I'll make you swallow a grenade, put an envelope and stamp in your hand and mail the pin to afghanistan 
 What I say makes sense in the mind frame I'm in, while you babble on (play on babylon) like the mediterranean 
 Throw you down the escalator just to sterilize you, deranged doctor with a scalpel to slice through 
 Anyone who contests, my cliques hard as nails, it'll be a done deal like mobb deep on sale. 
 Escaped convict for putting out mob hits, you're probably a homo and shave your armpits 
 APATHY (probably the illest rhyme I've ever heard) 
 We back on the breezblock, MC's drop from hittin weak spots, my beats pump like shotguns and reeboks, ' 
 you look softer than stuffed animal ewoks 
 (god damn!) while we stalk the street blocks and spit like when fat kids beatbox, got it locked like ol' dirty at detox, we'll never stop like cops going to donut shops 
 I'd let you rap but you're probly not worthy, besides its time to go yo its almost 3:30 
 I give skeletal fractures like wrestling matches, practice on you rappers if you think that ap is wacker 
 From Africa to Alaska my wax sells faster while the only distribution that y'all got is through napster 
 From the uk to usa we're gettin' play, while you prayin' every day for an open mic to display... 
 Your half ass wack raps y'all cats designed 
 You could never get signed, what are you out of your mind?
