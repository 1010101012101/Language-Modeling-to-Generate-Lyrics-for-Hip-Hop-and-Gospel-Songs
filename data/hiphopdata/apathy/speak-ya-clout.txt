 Demigod Scoundrel and my name is A.P. (x3) 
 Demigod Scoundrel 
 Last year, my record company was jumpin' me 
 I wrote "Fuck You" to show they couldn't fuck with me 
 And I never got dropped but I needed to do something quick 
 So I'm packin up my bags and I'm jumpin' ship 
 I write rhymes like a pimp, always gettin' my dick licked 
 Bitches sweat my "notebook" more than that chick flick 
 I'm nice with the rhymes but I'm nicer with the ladies 
 Leaving "boxers" on the floor like Tyson in the 80s 
 I'm a D.E.M.I.G.O.D. 
 Add a Z on the end 'cause I brought my friends 
 I'm known to fist fight quick and rock bright white kicks 
 Steal the show from bigger acts with the white stripe shit 
 I'm a arrogant fuck that keeps tearin it up 
 My dicks so big ya chick think I'm wearin a cup 
 I never ever rock Bapes people think they so hot 
 Nikes are transformers, Bathing Apes are Go-Bots 
 But back to the label shit, they not doin' nothin' 
 And I'm sick of tellin' fans I don't know when it's comin' 
 They just put out Lupe, they sleepin' on Saigon 
 Barely gave little brother love fuck it I'm gone
