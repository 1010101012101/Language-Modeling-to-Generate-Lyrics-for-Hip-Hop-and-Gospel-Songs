Apathetic (yeah) the heir to the thrown (word) 
 Mother molestors click (you know about that!) 
 My man Majik Most the sweaty back bastard 
 Yeah, yo don't even talk to us 
 Don't run up with your burned CD or piece of shit CD 
 With the cover picture on the front that your grandma took bitch... fuck you! 
 (Verse 1 - Apathy) 
 I turn rappers to dust, burn rappers who bust 
 Turn wax to cut, burn backs of sluts 
 Earn stacks of bucks, learn raps to crutch 
 You herb cats who touch the microphones I clutch 
 Just observe and take notes how I make paeso's and date hoes 
 Hotter than pepper on jalipanios 
 Paragraphs vibe through your speaker box 
 Making people stop on the streets to clock 
 Like cops in front of reefer spots 
 I'm known for pulling mics apart like repair shops 
 And when you bump I never feel it like air shocks 
 I used to rock air macks with Nike Air hats 
 Now I scare cats they compare Ap to bear traps 
 I'm the type of path that people don't cross 
 Like the blair witch woods when you suckers get lost 
 I'm the hottest thing alive flame broiling spots 
 I'm foiling plots, my brainwaves boiling pots 
 At a temperature the burners on your stove can't match 
 I bust caps cause my heads way too big for hats 
 I'm gonna test your girls physical stamina 
 While I'm diggin and slammin' her on the digital camera 
 So don't talk to me about MC's got skills 
 He's all right but he's not real 
 Don't talk to me about MC's got skills 
 They're okay but they're not ill 
 (Verse 2 - Majik Most) 
 Ay yo hold up, majiks on the case 
 Watch the flames from my tape ignite your gas tank 
 I lace you like your mom in a bondage suit 
 With matching hooker boots teaching you to tie your shoes 
 You lose every time I rhyme 
 I'll clothesline you off your scooter, your nothin' but a loooser! 
 I'm on some highschool shit with lolipops in my pocket 
 For hot chick on my dick under seventeen with my picture in their locket 
 On the club scene they don't need to take extacy they think about me 
 It's obvious I won't win a grammy from a song 
 But I'll run up in moeisha and get my brandy on 
 Ask me if I'm dope, C'MON I'M MAJIK MOST! 
 I'll roast you bitch, I barbeque kids till you just a fucking skeleton wearin a wig 
 I'm trying to be Mr. Big so don't talk to me bitch 
 (Verse 3 - Apathy) 
 You better watch what you say like lip syncing in mirrors 
 Quit thinkin' your near us, your not even a million miles close enough to hear us 
 I stand six feet back and spit these raps until the concrete streets crack 
 I simplfy just to pass it by the mass and burn you like ants under a mangnifying glass 
 Y'all are unerlings like the servents of kings 
 While I form ciphers and patterns like saturns circular rings 
 (It's Apathy) my soul purpose stands to cripple 
 My verses tear through tissue like surface to air missles 
 Navigating fighter planes safe to the ground 
 With one engine down and enimes circling all around 
 I'm mythical to hip hop fans some people hear 
 That I'm seven foot eight with three heads and no fear 
 They say I spit fire and I walk on air 
 Well if what they say is true then you'd better beware
