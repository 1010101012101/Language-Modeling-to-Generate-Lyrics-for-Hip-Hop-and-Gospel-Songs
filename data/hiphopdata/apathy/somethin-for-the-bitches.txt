(Verse 1: Suave-Ski) 
 This is for the freaks 
 Who stay up under them sheets 
 Head bobbing in my lap while I'm playing back all these beats 
 She got her tongue doing tricks 
 I got a ton of them chicks 
 Gymnasts who have fun doing flips 
 I want to beat it I ain't trying to make love 
 I'm all for all four on a oriental rug 
 From the back, steadily attack 
 Pin her till she tap, little slap 
 On a lot of ass, she a fan of that (yeah) 
 Popping and dropping and moppin 
 Whatever the option, I opt in 
 Baby I'm not him 
 Yoga pants splitting, I'm hitting without commitment 
 I'll rip it as soon as I slip in 
 I'm dipping all in that kitten 
 I need a porn chick, for this porn flick 
 I been nasty all my life, I was born sick 
 I'm a visionary, I see me doing you in Missionary 
 It's necessary 
 This is somethin' for the bitches 
 This is somethin' for the bitches 
 "Now girls step up to this" (x2) 
 (Verse 2: Prince Loyal) 
 You blowing me kisses 
 'Cause you know I'll swim in you like fishes 
 I'm a vicious ass crab 'cause I like to grab 
 And not let go, stab you in your gut until you blow 
 But my job's to make you happy and the nappy headed kids 
 (?) 
 But I spazzed on the knife that night 
 Let's fight the aliens and see the life together 
 I'll ride, whatever, I'm in the cockpit 
 With my cock pit in her mouth 
 Drop your draws bitch, my mind is headed down south 
 I'm about the action, but I'm not, cool with you crashing here 
 After I crash my rocket in you, all the atmosphere is there 
 The beauty turns you into beast, I put you on a leash 
 You sucked the whole voyage [?] 
 But I don't, fucking throw grenades on neighbors 
 Air her when she screaming my name 
 Like she can't be tamed 
 (Verse 3: Apathy)

 This is sponsored by the letter "H" 
 That little three letter word that every female hates 
 I want a fuck buddy, I ain't trying to bring you on dates 
 I want to fuck you while I fantasize of Phoebe Cates 
 I'm Norman Bates stabbing bitches in the shower for hours 
 Superman, Supa Ho, that's one of my super powers 
 Middle of the day on your Facebook lurking 
 I be jerking while you twerking in my 9 to 5 working 
 One thing's for certain, no more love rap 
 I just wanna shoot a million sperm in your butt crack 
 Get a babysitter for your ratchet ass, rugrats 
 Now you can tell all your homegirls you fucked Ap 
 Pulling off her britches, dick game vicious 
 Glass in the room shatter from your vocal pitches 
 Pussy muscle twitches, giving you the business 
 As God as my witness, this is...
