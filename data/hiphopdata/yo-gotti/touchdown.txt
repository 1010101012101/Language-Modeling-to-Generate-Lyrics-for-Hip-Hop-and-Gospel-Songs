Aye you know I'm cocaine crazy right? 
 These niggas go 
 White dis, white dat 
 (Quit fucking with me, white everything) 
 A lil bitch I fuck with talk bout she want white cat. 
 You know dis my city right? 
 (Hoe you crazy) 
 Pussy ass nigga 
 I got base in the trunk, highs on the inside, marshmallow paint 49ers on the inside 
 Touchdown, a nigga going long, field goal, extra point a nigga going strong 
 210 on the dash, blue jean inside, white wit blue top, like the yankees when I come past 
 Home run, that boy out the park, bases loaded, world series, that boy hustle smart 
 Streets Talkin' Gotti been doing good 
 Niggas wanna try em, couple niggas from the hood 
 You know how that go, niggas say you don't fuck wit em, truth be told wen I hustlin I ain't fuck wit em 
 Same nigga still owe me on a pack, think a nigga forgot becuz I'm rappin' nah... 
 When I get off the road I shoot back to my town 
 New whips, new watch, fuck with me, its goin' down 
 Own family hatin', niggas looking mad, guess it be little better if a nigga was doin' bad, 
 But momma got a smile, brother still wild I gotta get this money I just had another child, 
 They say I'm gettin' fat, guess I'm eatin good 
 20 racks in the motor, got my name under the hood, YO GOTTI, 
 Sometimes I think back, I could of went fed, this a chance in a lifetime I gotta think ahead
