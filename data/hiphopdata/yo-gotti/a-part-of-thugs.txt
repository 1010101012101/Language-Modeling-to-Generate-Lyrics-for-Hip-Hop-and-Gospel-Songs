She was light, bright, damn near white 
 Wit dem, Chinese eyes, and big girl thighs 
 And it was, so many rumors, and so many lies 
 About my, so many girls, and so many wives 
 That it, broke up my home, she left me alone 
 And I was tryin' to explain to her on the phone 
 But I'm like what was the use of tellin' the truth 
 Plus I was, trained at a youth to do what I do 
 So I just tell her some lies to make her feel good 
 Like, one day I'm movin you out the hood 
 It went from kisses and hugs to pushes and shoves but dat was all a part of Fuckin' wit thugs 
 If you was down you would steel fo' a nigga, stay by my side even kill fo' a nigga, if you fuck wit a nigga fo'real then it ain't nothing to keepin' it trill 
 She just, wanted to smile and wanted a child 
 But I was ruining her dreams by livin' too wild 
 She said I need to calm down and act like a man 
 And my response was like what the fuck is you sayin' 
 'Cause I was, so caught up into movin it white, and I was gone 24/7 a night 
 And I didn't give a fuck if I was wrong or was right 
 'Cause I was a d-boi livin' a d-boi's life 
 And she was a school girl slash d-boi's wife 
 And it was in wit the wrong and out wit the right 
 'Cause she was trafficin' and manufacturin drugs 
 But that was all apart of fuckin' wit thugs 
 If you was down you would steel fo' a nigga, stay by my side even kill fo' a nigga, if you fuck wit a nigga fo'real then it ain't nothing to keepin' it trill 
 We was tighter then fam, cooler than friends 
 We thought it would last 4ever and never would end 
 And we'd get mad at each other and try to pretend 
 Like we was callin it quits, wasn't speakin' again 
 We went our separate ways fo a couple of days 
 You know the separate phase fo' hell of some days 
 But uh I regret ever doin' her friend 
 But it was the need of the moment and you know us men 
 We just think wit out actin' my man was back trackin but still I say what I mean and mean what I say 'cause I'm real so play ya position and show us some love 'cause that was all a part of fuckin' wit thugs 
 If you was down you would steel fo' a nigga, stay by my side even kill fo' a nigga, if you fuck wit a nigga fo'real then it ain't nothing to keepin' it trill
