I'm on fire, whole 'hood blazin' 
 Hustle game incredible, ice game amazin' 
 Look in the mirror, look in the mirror, look in the mirror, look in the mirror 
 Look in the mirror, look in the mirror, look in the mirror 
 Mirror like a chandelier, look in the mirror, mirror 
 Ice super clear, clear, you lookin' in the mirror, mirror 
 Who you here to see when you look in the mirror 
 If you a real nigga, you lookin' in the mirror, mirror 
 I'm on fire, whole 'hood blazin' 
 Hustle game incredible, Ice game amazin' 
 Look in the mirror, look in the mirror, look in the mirror, look in the mirror 
 Look in the mirror, look in the mirror, look in the mirror 
 6 in the mornin' my alarm goes off 
 Dope come out the pot, then stove goes off 
 Knock, knock on the door I'm standin' ho on soft 
 Nigga try to rob me get his nose blowed off 
 Am I a real nigga? Point-blank peer 
 If you a pussy-nigga, you need pants for your peer 
 Damn right I'm gettin' money, half a million on the chair 
 It's goin' next in me if you don't think a nigga ser' 
 My whole house glass, look in that reflection 
 I'm cocaine crazy, got a all white section 
 All my niggas Mafia, I never even heard a ya 
 Quarter brick, half a brick, my young niggas will murder ya, murder ya 
 I'm on fire, whole 'hood blazin' 
 Hustle game incredible, ice game amazin' 
 Look in the mirror, look in the mirror, look in the mirror, look in the mirror 
 Look in the mirror, look in the mirror, look in the mirror 
 Mirror like a chandelier, look in the mirror, mirror 
 Ice super clear, clear, you lookin' in the mirror, mirror 
 Who you here to see when you look in the mirror 
 If you a real nigga, you lookin' in the mirror, mirror 
 Wake up in the morning and I wash my face 
 Brush my teeth and put my gun on my waist 
 Louis belt: check, Louis shoes: check 
 Car on my wrist and a house on my neck 
 Last I remember I was standin' on Garland 
 Barin' kin for the hundred, I done reach Crescent Projects 
 Drop B-team material on 106th and Park 
 And no mistake, Gucci dead fresh on the regardless 
 I represent the Dope Boyz, I can't say it any clearer 
 You lookin' at me when you lookin' in the mirror 
 I motivate the trap, give the 'hood niggas hope 
 'Cause I became a millionaire and now I'm sellin' dope 
 I'm on fire, whole 'hood blazin' 
 Hustle game incredible, ice game amazin' 
 Look in the mirror, look in the mirror, look in the mirror, look in the mirror 
 Look in the mirror, look in the mirror, look in the mirror 
 Mirror like a chandelier, look in the mirror, mirror 
 Ice super clear, clear, you lookin' in the mirror, mirror 
 Who you here to see when you look in the mirror 
 If you a real nigga, you lookin' in the mirror, mirror 
 Pulled a nine from the kitchen, it's the Pyrex King 
 Straight from Northern Memphis to your T.V. screen 
 Couple foreign cars, all white everything 
 Keep a cool hundred grand in my Levi jeans 
 White and red colors, same color as a Smirnoff 
 One ticket, two ticket, I could take a year off 
 Got my money up, think I'm movin' where the beach is 
 Most dollar 'hood and famous, where the fuck is Robin Leach at? 
 I'm on fire, whole 'hood blazin' 
 Hustle game incredible, ice game amazin' 
 Look in the mirror, look in the mirror, look in the mirror, look in the mirror 
 Look in the mirror, look in the mirror, look in the mirror 
 Mirror like a chandelier, look in the mirror, mirror 
 Ice super clear, clear, you lookin' in the mirror, mirror 
 Who you here to see when you look in the mirror 
 If you a real nigga, you lookin' in the mirror, mirror
