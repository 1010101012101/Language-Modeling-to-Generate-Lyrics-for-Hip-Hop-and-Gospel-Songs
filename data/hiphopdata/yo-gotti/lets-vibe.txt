 Shawty ride or die here for sober or high 
 She know jus wat to do to help a gangsta get by 
 Shawty know a I like head... she ain't trippin' at all 
 She go down on a nigga and she a swallow it all 
 Me and her done it all, catch us both at the mall 
 She can get wat she wanna and it ain't trickin at all 
 Shawty fukk wit her nigga her nigga fukk wit her bakk 
 She put her life on the line 'cause she a ride wit this sack 
 Wen I went bakk to the hood hustlin movin them birds 
 She was takin' up nurses studying gettin' wats hers 
 I ain't chase her or sweat her try my best to protect her 
 Wen you fukk wit a gangsta baby you bet imma bless ya 
 And that's real 
 If you wanna come ride then (lets ride) 
 If you wanna come smoke then (lets smoke) 
 If you wanna come drink then (lets drink) 
 If you wanna come vibe then (lets vibe) Come vibe *baby* 
 I been thinkin' bout fuckin' you 
 I been thinkin' bout kissin' you 
 And touchin and lovin' you (that's all I wanna do baby) 
 Wen we out on the road granted doin' ma shows 
 She be callin my phone like don't be fuckin' them hoes 
 She at home wit my child I be flirtin in the crowd 
 I need help I can't control myself these hoes be wild 
 As I think to myself another nigga in my bed 
 So I start thinkin' it off that shit a fukk up yo head 
 My confedearal Jesus I work so hard for the bread 
 Wonder if she a keep it real if I eva go to the feds 
 She gon write me and visit me like I think that she should 
 Or she gon disrespect me fukk another nigga out the hood 
 I ain't chase her or sweat her try my best to protect her 
 I don't know about love I jus know jus know wat imma get ya 
 If you wanna come ride then (lets ride) 
 If you wanna come smoke then (lets smoke) 
 If you wanna come drink then (lets drink) 
 If you wanna come vibe then (lets vibe) Come vibe *baby* 
 I been thinkin' bout fuckin' you 
 I been thinkin' bout kissin' you 
 And touchin and lovin' you (that's all I wanna do baby) 
 When yo momma was trippin' talkin' bout kickin you out 
 You had nowhere to go I let you move in my house 
 You can jump in my benz, go stunt out on ya friends 
 I took you all around the world and I a do it again 
 You respected my grind 'cause you knew I had dat work 
 And I respected ya mind because you still went to work 
 See it wasn't 'bout the money shawty kept it *one hundred* 
 She stayed in tune wit her family because they knew I was hustlin 
 If you wanna come ride then (lets ride) 
 If you wanna come smoke then (lets smoke) 
 If you wanna come drink then (lets drink) 
 If you wanna come vibe then (lets vibe) Come vibe baby 
 I been thinkin' bout fuckin' you

 And touchin and lovin' you (that's all I wanna do baby)
