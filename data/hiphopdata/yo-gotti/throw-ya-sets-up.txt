 Before we spark up some shit and leave the club televised 
 My cousin still thuggin' that nigga paralyzed. 
 Clubbin in his wheelchair sittin' on his 45 
 If a nigga trip he gon wish he wouldn't 
 Sucerity tried to stop the bullshit but he couldn't 
 I see blue flags (what else) 
 I see red flags (what else) 
 I see niggas that ain't reppin with they scared ass 
 My projects bangin' bandanas tied to rails 
 And you can get served but I ain't talkin' digit scales 
 Fully automatic gunfire yeah it feel like hell 
 I'm high as hell before ya die bitch ya might as well.
