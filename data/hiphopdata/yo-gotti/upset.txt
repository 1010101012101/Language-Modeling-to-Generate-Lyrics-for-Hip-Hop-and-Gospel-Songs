 I go hard on these hater till they upset (Verse 1- Starlito) Niggas wildin in tha club throwin' up sets 
 I'm gettin' money fuckin' hoes got em' upset 
 Like the 16 seed in the Final Four 
 A 16 without a seed is what I'm tryna smoke 
 That's my kinda drodown in Orange Mound 
 Got a fine lil hoejus got a spot in Memphis been grindin so (hard) Betta tell em' Yo 
 I go upside ya head bout my fetti tho 
 Cut tha check homeboy shit fuck that 
 Niggas are not loyal I don't trust shit

 That's what my southside slut said 
 That's Cashville tough talk I give her rough sex 
 All white everything okay what's next?I'm only fuckin' with tha green, green nigga suspects 
 Ya homeboys wasn't round you wasn't tough yet 
 A nigga swerve up on ya, you won't get to bust back 
 Chorus (Verse 2- Yo Gotti) Ok Lito got me on my rapping shit, ok my snapping shit 
 Lito, ima need one track for this no adlibs or shit 
 One take 1K one chain 100KOne house a couple mil 
 Bitches fake my niggas real 
 Yeah you niggas ill you niggas sick 
 And I go hard on a nigga bout his main bitch 
 I be on that gang shit that Sadam Hussein shit 
 Eye for eye ride for my guy bigidy bang shit That's offset when the rims bow legged 
 The more you get her upset the more I burn ya hoe head 
 Now that's an upset stomach 
 The more you think about it don't it make you wanna vomit 
 Ugh virus white like Miley Cyrus 
 Police and niggas out here ridin' with sirens 
 Niggas throwin' temper tantrums pissy fits silence 
 We ain't on that bitchin shit me and my niggas violent
