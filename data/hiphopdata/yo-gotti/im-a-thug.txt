(Feat. D-Nero) 
 I'm a gangsta (gangsta)

 I ain't a g I ain't a crip I ain't a blood 
 But I be fuckin' with them niggas I'm a thug x2 
 I got respect 
 I came from the streets 
 If a nigga didn't hustle then a nigga didn't eat homie (homie) 
 And ain't nan nigga took nuttin 
 Playin' with me money 
 Make ya mami go and book somethin' 
 A fruit of a for that bitch ass nigga 
 Ole dick in a booty slitch nich ass nigga (look) a couple niggas got fronted 
 Took to long with me money 
 Send them youngstas to that dumpin bitch 
 And I got soljas on my team 
 That will die for the I to tha e 
 The feds want me bad because they know I got them killa niggas out tha north 
 If Gotti get tha word they'll take them niggas off 
 And kids wanna be just like me 
 Systems tryna dig cause some shit wan indict me 
 I sold hella keys made hella cheese 
 And all my niggas what convicted felonies 'cause a 
 You wanna beef with c'mon lets go get 'em man 
 Fuck talkin' I'm tryna be the first one to hit 'em man 
 My patience little man 
 Don't take alot of bullets man 
 Drop 'em where the stand with one squeeze you don't understand 
 This a hard knock of life for niggas 
 Take a pentatentery chance throwin' bricks to prison 
 And I ain't talkin' 'bout no polka 
 But I watch niggas fold 
 Fuck them other niggas 'cause them other niggas hoes 
 Them niggas hoes that's the verdict case closed 
 Ain't shit like they say 
 We da streets we know 
 7 out of 10 of dem niggas who talkin' gangsta need a g replaced with the w 'cause they wankstas (ain't cha) 
 And I guess we like the black sheep 
 We live where we speak 
 So we neva talk cheap 
 These niggas vegetarians don't wanna see no beef 
 When it come they want peace 
 But me I want a piece 'cause 
 Back in 95 
 Got a pick da side 
 With them big guys 
 They seen it in my eyes 
 They had a lot of pies 
 Money to the vibe 
 I knew no betta but whateva I was down to ride 
 And neva asked about tha shit dat they owe me 
 Just did wat they showed me 
 Or did what they told me 
 The littlest nigga with tha biggest fuckin' 
 Balls I was down for tha motha fuckin' cause 
 Now I must say today I'm a rich cred veteran 
 Shot alot of niggas 'cause I sold a lot of medicine 
 Did a lot of shit that you may think irrelavent 
 I masked on them rappers 'cause they play with my intelligence 
 They had white when the price was cheapa 
 They hate the mel row 
 And now my brothers keepa 
 Alot of niggas may not think the same 
 'Cause they lame 
 They just rap they wasn't in tha game get it
