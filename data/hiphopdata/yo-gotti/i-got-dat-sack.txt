 Security tried to search a nigga but we coming through the back 
 See the sparklers in the air? You know them bottle's on the way 
 CMG taking over mane, that's all the DJ play, right on, right on 
 In the club with my white on, shawty got something tight on 
 And if that's your bitch then you might have to fight homes 
 Gripping on her ass, niggas say I'm disrespectful 
 I pulled up in that Lamb', niggas say I disrespected 'em 
 If I'm wanted then I'm running fast, know they gotta catch me 
 Niggas shot at me and missed, oh, the Lord blessed him 
 I sell dope, I fuck hoes and make songs 'bout the shit 
 I rob niggas for they work and don't feel wrong 'bout the shit 
 You a pussy ass nigga, you don't belong with no bricks

 In the club going hard, niggas know I got them racks 
 In the kitchen whipping hard, niggas know I got that sack 
 In this bitch going hard, niggas know I got them racks 
 In the kitchen whipping hard, niggas know I got that sack 
 Niggas standing on the couches, throwing signs on the club
