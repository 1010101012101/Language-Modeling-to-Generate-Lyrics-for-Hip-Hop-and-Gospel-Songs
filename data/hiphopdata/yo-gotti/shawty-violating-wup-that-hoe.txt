(Feat. La' Chat) 
 Wup that hoe [x13] 
 (Chorus x2: Yo Gotti) 
 Wup that hoe, Wup that hoe (she fucked yo baby daddy) 
 Wup that hoe, wup that hoe (shit I ain't mad at ya) 
 Wup that hoe, wup that hoe (shawty violating) 
 Wup that hoe, wup that hoe (shawty been hating) 
 There were two hoes, Yo Gotti, one couple hearin 
 Who be hollering look at that hoe fucking her friend 
 Knowing 'bout the beef and shit I gone tuck my eyesPop my collar, hit my boy and let these hoes fight 
 Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee 
 Shawty got a right like she Laila Ali 
 That's just my baby mama 
 And her best friend 
 Coming out they stilettos to do these hoes in 
 U fucked the wrong nigga 
 Caught the wrong bitch 
 Hit the wrong club, and got yo ass kicked 
 I fuck wit hood hoes 
 Them hoes stay jacking 
 Look at shawty weave 
 I'm like dammmmnnnn what happened 
 Wup that hoe [x13] 
 (Verse 2: Lil' Chat) 
 The hoe done fucked my baby daddy 
 Now the hoe is out here braggin' 
 When I see the hoe, through the door her ass I'm gone be draggin' 
 Bitch I be ya mad 
 What you did hoe is nothing 
 But I gotta beat yo ass 'cause you think you did something 
 I ain't fucked up 'bout no nigga 
 Niggas coming by the dozen 
 I be with da shit, my paper is thick, like niggas kill they cousin 
 Talkin' shit now I can't go 
 Throw dem thangs on dat hoe 
 See you buckin in da club before you know you on da floor 
 I be strapped like jab in the back 
 Beat dem killers that's gone attack 
 Hoe you know its gone be on when you talking about fucking off with Lil' Chat 
 Bust these bitches with a bottle 
 Naw I'll bust you with my popper 
 Hoe you really don't want no problem 'cause my 38 will resolve them 
 Hoe you fresh straight out the mall 
 Brand new set, get staright, get dirt 
 Shit it's gonna help you get blazed up 'cause you'll get smoked just like some perk 
 I don't play no games with these bitches 
 Lil' Chat straight gone let you know 
 If you disrespect my gangsta 
 Imma staright up wup you hoe! (straight up wup you hoe) 
 My main girl trippin', she think I'm fucking off 
 Ask me 'bout some bitches, I had to play it off 
 Told me if she catch me then she gone cut a shine 
 Found a couple rubbers but I told her they weren't mine 
 She checked my phone, she watched my home, she searched my clothes 
 She asked me 'bout 
 Where I'm at and who I'm with 
 She tryna figure pimpin' out 
 She cursed me out said I'm a dog 
 She sitting here crying and saying I'm wrong 
 Calling my phone all through the night and ask me when I'm coming home 
 Rule number 1, if shawty from the projects 
 Niggas takin' care of, you hoes better respect that 
 Nigga got her pregnant, you hoes better respect that 
 Where I'm from hoes get guns and leave hoes wet 
 Wup that hoe, wup that hoe [till fade out]
