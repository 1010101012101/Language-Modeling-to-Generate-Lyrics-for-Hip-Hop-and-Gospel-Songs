 Ain't yosemite sam nor elmer fudd 
 Got a mossberg pump and it filled with slugs 
 Hit ya homie in tha mouth 
 You ran that's how tha cookie crumble 
 Damn dude fast he remind me of the road runner 
 You ain't gon kill nothin' or let nothin' die 
 Be tha first to testify to tha fbi 
 Yo gotti got guns we ain't seen before 
 Ar-15s, red beams and scopes 
 Ya moms house got sprayed 
 And ya man's got hit 
 You was all on a dinner date trickin to a bitch 
 Yeen shot nobody 
 Yeen sold no o's 
 Yeen been on a mission 
 Kicked down no doors 
 Yeen pimped no bitches 
 Yeen with no riches 
 Yeen cut a nigga head and made 'em go get stitches 
 Yeen bout yo skrilla 
 And you sho ain't a boss 
 You ain't help yo niggas 
 You can't seen no cross 
 You with ya ho romantic

 On the map cold deala like shootin that cannon 
 And ya bitch can get it to 
 So get a cap gun 
 Gangsta why tha fuck you run wit a gun 
 Real niggas don't press charges 
 What tha fuck you doin' 
 You on tha stand pointin fingers at preliminary hearing 
 Me vs the state and you was the victim 
 Thought you said you was a solja 
 You runnin' with killas 
 Yeah tha truth hurts nigga 
 But not more than bullets 
 I make a bond get a gun 
 Run up on you and pull it 
 You niggas square as a pool table 
 And twice as green 
 Type of nigga take all his work and front it to fiends 
 Real gangstas get money 
 And they call tha shots 
 Got block burnas that don't rap 
 I can get you shot 
 Every now and then niggas tryna get tha don killed 
 That's why I neva leave tha house without my heata concealed 
 I got one in tha cham when I jump in that range 
 Keep my hand on tha trigga 
 I blow out ya brains 
 Leave tha club switchin lanes 
 Half a life doin' a hundred 
 Tryna catch this crash dummy that wont pay me my money 
 I'm from north memphis nigga we don't play that shit 
 You threw ya door fenders and windas 
 And kill that bitch
