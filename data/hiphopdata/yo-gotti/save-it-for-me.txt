 Passed my number to Angela, I thought I had her 
 Her nigga cuffed her, married, it made me madder 
 I respect it, I'm moving on, but the truth is I want her badder 
 Maybe me sayin' her name made him move faster (facts) 
 Maybe me bein' a G was kind of bad for her 
 But me bein' a G, I was glad for her 
 My baby mama was pissed, I ain't heard the last from her 
 My side bitch with the shit, but I bought a bag for her

 Told you once, I get my money, I'm comin' back for you 
 You from the hood, I'm from the hood, I shoot this MAC for you 
 She was thick, light skinned, her name was Constance 
 I never got to fuck with her, it still fuck with my conscience 
 Every hood got that one bitch

 You called my homegirl but the feeling's deeper 
 Whoever got her she a keeper 
 She from the hood, she my people

 All these niggas downloadin', tryna steal my sauce 
 Everybody in my girl DM's, you supposed to be my dog 
 But she don't reply to 'em, she send me the screenshot 
 Just in case, when I pull up you can't lie about it 
 Beat his ass, with a strap, I wish a nigga would 
 I love my bad bitch, but I love that chopper too 
 Poppin' tags, she like shopping bags, look at all her shoes 
 Ain't no limitations when you popping and you got the juice 
 All of this money I'm making today 
 I can see why they hate me, she really love me 
 And she know I'm crazy, but that's still my baby 
 She the first lady, sex me too amazing 
 She say she gon' save it for me
