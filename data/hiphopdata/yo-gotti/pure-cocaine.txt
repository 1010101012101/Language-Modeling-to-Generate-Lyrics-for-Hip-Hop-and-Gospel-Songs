(Feat. Young Cash and Gucci Mane) 
 Pure cocaine, pure cocaine x3 
 All I ever served out in these streets is pure cocaine 
 Young cash 
 Yeah, I never thought I would be ridin' dirty on i-10 just reup and flip again, 
 Rent a car from enterprise license proof of insurance 
 Speed limit 65 so I'm goin' 62, 
 Both hands on the steering wheel drivin' like a old lady do 
 Crackers pull me over they ain't got shit gotta let me dip, 
 Purple haze is all I smoke but she couldn't make it on this trip 
 Usaully keep a pistol too one in the chamber clip full, 
 Not today on i-10 its nothing but me and redbull 
 Collared shirt brown slacks lookin' like a business man, 
 Bible on the passenger side yeah I'm a christian man 
 Yeah I pray to god let me get these bricks back lord, 
 Please don't let these crackers try to search this lil ol' honda accord. 
 Shit I'm wide awake, I ain't sleepy so I ain't gon swerve 
 Told you I like to trap it when it rain I call 'em thunderbirds 
 I'm the only one touch the work so I know its uncut, 
 'Cause I don't move nothing but, nothin' but, nothin' but 
 Yo gotti 
 Remember me cocaina you like my best friend, 
 When I was down and fucked up you got my ass in 
 Far as I remember my nigga my life been full of pain, 
 I posted up in the snow I stood out in the rain 
 I laid that white on the table I watch 'em catch a drain, 
 I knew right then right there that I would never live the same 
 I'm like a bird myself nigga wrap me up and move me, 
 I got a stamp in the middle the whole hood approve me 
 But you can't break me down (down) you gotta sell me whole (whole), 
 It's a drought on real niggas you already know 
 I'm that ether nigga that fish scale, 
 You that oil base homie you don't cook well 
 I'm yo gotti the king and I got that young cash, 
 New money in a mufuckin dufflebag 
 Old hundreds in a sour creme ruffles bag, 
 Dope money bitch I keep a couple hundred stashed 
 Gucci mane 
 Cocaina heavily cooking dope excessively, 
 Heavy risk activity my god given ability 
 Hid the bricks in the 6 wait till they get low to ???, 
 Shawty snort a lotta powder let her snort it off the bricks 
 Gucci mane the dope boy point me where the jays at, 
 Heres a 50 slab watch my'74 to payday 
 Shawty want some hardball baby want some powder, 
 I'm so high I see stone mountain 
 Gucci got da birds I ain't talkin' bout da falcons, 
 Gucci slangin birds also known as a dragon 
 Hundred pounds of midgrade stash that in my magnum, 
 Roll it to the country then them country boys I tax them 
 Gucci mane bastard cook dat dope faster, 
 Make that dope stretch like a 80 inch plasma 
 Coke stank dope stank smokin' on my airplane,
