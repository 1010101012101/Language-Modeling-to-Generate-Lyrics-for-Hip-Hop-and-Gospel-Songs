Started from the ground 
 Building to the sky now 
 Watch it fall down 
 How you gon' survive now? 
 Yeah, it's cold blood in a nigga 
 The streets left no love in a nigga 
 If I could paint a picture 
 I would show the image of a dog ass nigga 
 Yeah, raw ass nigga 
 Popping pain killers 
 Praying for a call, four dogs with them pistols 
 Natural born killers 
 We sold crack to his mother, he turn his back on his brothers 
 Killed his partner for the plug 
 He think everything a hustle 
 Cold motherfucker 
 Oh no, I'm black hearted 
 No feelings, just a gun 
 We was raised in the trenches 
 Not to mention all the hoes had dissed him 
 So homes think the whole world against him 
 Played ball, coach benched him, 
 Grandpa Klan lynched him, 
 He raised in Mississippi but he moved up to Memphis 
 Kind of hard to adapt 
 So homes turned to the strap 
 To succeed tried rap, couldn't fight got slapped 
 Shot dice threw craps, did time back out, damn 
 And from the ground 
 We build it to the sky now 
 Watch it fall down 
 How you gon' survive now? 
 Yeah, it's cold blood in a nigga 
 The streets left no love in a nigga 
 Started from the ground 
 Building to the sky now 
 Watch it fall down 
 How you gon' survive now? 
 Yeah, it's cold blood in a nigga 
 The streets left no love in a nigga 
 Here's a voice for the voiceless 
 My words like multiple choice to the choiceless 
 Emerge like a search light in the darkness 
 For this young, black carcass 
 My niggas either join the Armed Forces, or they corpses now 
 In God we trust But it's bucks that we worship, now 
 Boy that root of evil gon' forever rule the people 
 See, I seen just what that fast money gon' come and do to people 
 Hit a lick, it was a hit 
 He said, "Let's go and do the sequel" 
 But his, nigga wasn't 'bout it, nigga wasn't 'bout it, now 
 Feeling guilty, "What would Momma think about me?" 
 Told' em, think about it nigga, won't you think about it now? 
 But he was money hungry 
 Plus he trigger happy 
 So they hopped up in the Caddy 
 Burners packed just like a stadium 
 Thirty minutes later, blood is leaking at the ATM 
 Momma in denial, like her baby boy on trial 
 For a murder that he ain't commit 
 Tears soak the handkerchief 
 And from the ground 
 We build it to the sky now 
 Watch it fall down 
 How you gon' survive now? 
 Yeah, it's cold blood in a nigga 
 The streets left no love in a nigga 
 Started from the ground 
 Building to the sky now 
 Watch it fall down 
 How you gon' survive now? 
 Yeah, it's cold blood in a nigga 
 The streets left no love in a nigga 
 Lights off, no candles, roaches all around the kitchen 
 Nigga hungry, mom embarrassed so she don't want us to mention it 
 Grandma wanna help but mama ego kickin' in 
 She a hustler, she don't need no help raisin her kids 
 Bills came, got evicted, stay strong 
 Swear that she ain't never shown weakness, real shit 
 That created the hunger 
 And that make the monsters 
 Got the game from my mama, that's some ill shit 
 13 on the block, he was a little kid 
 In the kitchen, on the stove like it's a cook out 
 No nigga mouth to the game, could put a book out 
 Right when he thought it was over he got took out (bang) 
 Brains leaking, they sneaked him, he ain't even see it coming 
 He a hitter, he won't focus so he died over nothing 
 No revenge, with his friends shooting dice 
 Bet again, win or lose, take it all, took out by his own men 
 And from the ground 
 We build it to the sky now 
 Watch it fall down 
 How you gon' survive now? 
 Yeah, it's cold blood in a nigga 
 The streets left no love in a nigga 
 Started from the ground 
 Building to the sky now 
 Watch it fall down 
 How you gon' survive now? 
 Yeah, it's cold blood in a nigga 
 The streets left no love in a nigga 
 They say the good die young, that's the truth 
 My nigga floating up in heaven now, that's the proof 
 I ain't make it to the funeral, but homie rest in peace 
 If this world get too cold, I hope one day you rescue me 
 Nigga maybe we can fly someday 
 Oh we can fly someday 
 Yeah up in the sky someday 
 Do real niggas get to heaven? 
 That's that shit I ask the reverend 
 They say the good die young, that's the truth 
 My nigga floating up in heaven now, that's the proof 
 I ain't make it to the funeral, but homie rest in peace 
 If this world get too cold, I hope one day you rescue me 
 Nigga maybe we can fly someday 
 Oh we can fly someday 
 Yeah up in the sky someday 
 Do real niggas get to heaven? 
 That's that shit I ask the reverend
