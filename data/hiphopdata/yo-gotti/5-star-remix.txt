 See da proof man 
 Cause ain't none of these hoes, 
 Doin' shows in the recession 
 They cards get declined, 
 Now they sufferin a depression 
 While I'm spendin mills 
 Signin all kinda deals

 Eating 5 star meals 
 My whole life style 
 Like comin' to America 
 All my Louie luggage 
 You see my bag 
 How I carry ha 
 Walkin' through the airport 
 Like I'm in a parade on my hologram 
 Loggin on to e-Trade

 (Nicki Minaj) 
 I just had a epiphany, 
 I need to go to Tiffany's 
 Fendi on my slippers, 
 And my cookies always slippery 
 I don't need help, 
 I pay da bills on time 
 So I be yellin' "fuck em" 
 With a dildo sign 
 Five little mama, you a Three star 
 I ain't sleepin' when 
 I say I'm in my dream car 
 Oh did I stutta? 
 Harajuku hyphen, 
 BarBie... I'm hot 
 I think it's time to put the rice in 
 I was in the chair, 
 I was gluing my weave in 
 When you hit the stage 
 They was booin and leavin' 
 Young money red flag, 
 No more auditions 
 Ask Lil Wayne who da 5 star bitch is! 
 Dats a 5 star bitch (3x) 
 Now dats a 5 star bitch
