Ay nigga... 
 When you talkin' memphis you talkin' me... 
 Nigga I am memphis 
 Who the only motherfucker with a half a million dollars worth of cars and everything white biotch? 
 I'm cocaine crazy! 
 To my city north memphis where they get get it gutta 
 And I learned how to sell cocaine from my big brother 
 While tryna tell my sister to carry her ass to school 
 Gotta do the right thing 'cause your brother breakin the rules 
 What an inspiration 
 What a role model 
 Man I'm tryna follow footsteps of my father 
 And he a og nigga straight outta hyde park 
 It took me so many years to get along with hyde park 
 I left that v shit alone and took upon a job 
 I put the north on the map 
 Each and every part, 
 Each and every hood, 
 Every single gangsta, 
 All the dope boys, 
 And every gang banger, 
 Would you believe me if I told you I was a millionaire? 
 My lamborghini paid for. 
 And the truth is I don't fuckin' care 
 I don't respect money 
 Respect real niggas 
 Want for money only get you killed nigga 
 Can't buy love, 
 Can't hide hate 
 100% percent fact, 
 Most niggas fake, 
 Most bitches lie, 
 But some bitches don't, 
 Most niggas change, 
 But my niggas won't 
 Nigga welcome to memphis 
 I'm in the kitchen 
 Sunday night it's goin' down, 
 Fall in at visions 
 Pop me some bottles, 
 Find me some bitches 
 Just gimme a room, 
 Handle my business 
 Goin' to river (river) 
 Look at the bridge (bridge) 
 Blunt to the head 
 Think 'bout the shit that I did 
 Walk in the bank, 
 Everyone helps 
 Walkin' outta the bank, 
 And I'm feelin' myself 
 Cut on the TV, 
 And I'm seein' myself 
 Real talk dawg I really like bein myself 
 Bet, mtv I'm seein' myself, 
 Real talk dawg I really like bein myself (gotti!) 
 Really like bein myself (gotti!) 
 If I was you I would wanna be me too. 
 Broke ass niggas! 
 Ha ha ha! 
 Niggas just... wanna rap like gotti. 
 Niggas got a fake gotti twitter page. 
 All kind of shit. 
 Feelin' myself, 
 Said I'm feelin' myself 
 Bein' myself 
 Said I really like bein myself
