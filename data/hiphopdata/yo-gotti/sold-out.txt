 Lined up outside they said this motherfucker sold out, 
 Word on the count they said that motherfucker showed out.

 DJ played that gangsta shit, the waitress brought the rolls out.

 50 dollar hat, hundred on the chain 
 Thousand dollar jeans, I come to do my thing. 
 50 on the wanch, twanky on the ring, 
 Bass hitting hard, club off the chain. 
 Fire marshall tripping, they want to shut us down 
 Laws raid the club, they try to shake us down. 
 Helicopter high, we ain't coming down 
 You ain't smokin' these, this shit from out of town. 
 Goons on stage, security in the crowd 
 Bitches pull my shirt, plus they want my towels. 
 They say you cool as hell, and you ain't Hollywood 
 I say I'm real as hell, because I come from the hood.

 Catch me in your city, walkin' through the mall 
 And I ain't in your city, if I ain't strapped dog. 
 I'm a bad bitch, I picked through them all 
 But I ain't fucking nothing, if I ain't strapped dog.

 Yeah it's been a ball, but I gotta catch a flight.
