Women lie, men lie 
 Women lie, men lie 
 Women lie, men lie 
 Numbers don't lie 
 (Verse 1 - Yo Gotti) 
 Aye, step up in the party and them bad bitches be on me 
 I be sipping on Patron, when I'm jumping out Ferraris 
 I be rocking Gucci sometimes Louis, I'm retarded 
 And them rims by Asanti but the shades by Bulgari 
 Hand on my strap, I got my mind on my money 
 Got my mind on my dime 
 You ain't taking nothing from me 
 Hated on these choppers here 
 Hated on these choppers here 
 Hated on the hood now because this how much the chopper shoot 
 Balling is my hobby, got a hundred going shopping 
 Got a five star with me and I met her in the lobby 
 Took her to the room, she hit me with that line 
 Say she ain't that type of girl so I told her "Stop lying" 
 (Verse 2 - Lil Wayne) 
 Young Money, yeah, okay 
 I ain't got to lie, cross my heart hope to die 
 The numbers don't lie, G5, over sky 
 I fucked her pussy good, make her cry if I tried 
 But I'm tired of being sick, and I'm sick of being tired 
 Tired of these niggas, and tired of these bitches 
 But shit let them lie, long as they ain't snitching 
 And men lie about women and shit 
 Women lie about plenty 
 They ain't lying on me 
 I'm in the bed with two fine bitches lying on me 
 So that would make three, and numbers don't lie 
 And money don't lie 
 And neither do I 
 Bitch! 
 (Verse 3 - Yo Gotti) 
 I'm trying to count to a billion 
 My bitch Brazilian 
 Hop in that Lamb' 
 Push the button lose the ceiling 
 Sun out no raindrops 
 Posted in the same spot 
 Right here in North, North Memphis where I came from 
 Hundred on the neck, I ain't never had shit 
 The streets gave me family, Barry White cut the check 
 Ain't no secret in the streets 
 Niggas know I got it 
 Got swagger through the roof 
 I was born just to flex 
 Zip code on my wrist 
 Phone number in the bank 
 In my ten till six 
 With my 305 paint 
 I got my 357 and my 501s 
 And Lear 55 with my Air Force Ones
