I got a check, check, check (beep) 
 Bitch I got a check, check, check 
 Bitch I got a check 
 I buy anything I want 'cause I got a check 
 Fuck any bitch I want 'cause I got a check 
 I only ride foreign 'cause I got a check 
 You know I'm fully armed, you ain't gotta check 
 And every time you see me I be on deck 
 Looking like money, smelling like a check 
 Brand new swag, got me on flex 
 Whole lot of cash, I'm a walking check 
 Uh, I got my check up 
 Ugh I need a check up 
 Watch on me so cold, chain on me so froze 
 Check, I got them hoes, check, designer clothes 
 I got them bows, plus I got them o's 
 Going hard, nigga I do too, 
 I got shooters nigga, what 'bout you 
 Valet park nigga there's my coupe 
 Popping bottles nigga, there's my crew 
 That pussy good, ass fat 
 Head right, nigga that's my boo 
 A real nigga, you ain't one 
 Hate on me, that's what you do 
 Ooh I'm in my zone, ooh, my money long 
 Sipping on that ciroc, inhaling all of the strong 
 I'm on my young nigga shit, rollie with the bezel 
 I'm on my rich nigga shit, Rolls Royce are better 
 I buy anything I want 'cause I got a check 
 Fuck any bitch I want 'cause I got a check 
 I only ride foreign 'cause I got a check 
 You know I'm fully armed, you ain't gotta check 
 And every time you see me I be on deck 
 Looking like money, smelling like a check 
 Brand new swag, got me on flex 
 Whole lot of cash, I'm a walking check 
 I put on for my city, go strong when I kick it 
 Got a bad girl's club, a gang of bad bitches 
 Black diamond, AP, oil spill, BP 
 White diamond muerla 
 No diamond, Hublot 
 Ace of Spades, no cards 
 Don P that glow in the dark 
 I got soft, I go hard 
 Stop the beat my favorite part 
 The California my favorite car, 
 The last line was my favorite bar 
 I hit the club, my jays on, they ain't out yet 
 And stood on the box 
 Selling dope my first job 
 Getting money, they worst thought 
 I'm in this bitch with my home boys 
 Big jewellery, no bodyguard 
 I pull up, like who this, thugged out, I do this 
 Checking on my dollar sign 
 Get money on my to do list, hey! 
 I buy anything I want 'cause I got a check 
 Fuck any bitch I want 'cause I got a check 
 I only ride foreign 'cause I got a check 
 You know I'm fully armed, you ain't gotta check 
 And every time you see me I be on deck 
 Looking like money, smelling like a check 
 Brand new swag, got me on flex 
 Whole lot of cash, I'm a walking check 
 Check, check, bitch I'm on deck 
 Flex, flex, looking like a check 
 Check, check, bitch I'm on deck 
 Flex, flex, looking like a check 
 I buy anything I want 'cause I got a check 
 Fuck any bitch I want 'cause I got a check 
 I only ride foreign 'cause I got a check 
 You know I'm fully armed, you ain't gotta check
