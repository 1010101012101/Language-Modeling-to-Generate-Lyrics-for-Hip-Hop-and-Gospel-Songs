40 dollar jeans, thousand dollar shades 
 Walk up in the club like a KKK parade. 
 DJ scream my name, bitches turn they head. 
 Light sign on my section, I holla can I get some head. 
 I don't need no jewelry, and I don't need no goons 
 Wherever I might stand, I'm the realist nigga in the room 
 Never cop a plea, and don't throw in the towel 
 Gangsta, and you know it, fuck it take them hoes to trial 
 (Nigga we don't cop no pleas pussy, nigga our money right, lawyers paid. p12 nigga, CM5 bitch) 
 I got money on my mind, bitches in my bed 
 Problems in my household, niggas in the feds 
 Yeah them my dogs, so I collect they calls 
 Record label bullshittin, put my shit on pause 
 'Cause I won't make no single commercial shit I rap for y'all 
 So fuck the industry, and my enemies kill them all 
 Bullet in the chamber, bitch yo life in danger 
 Mama never told you don't be conversating with strangers 
 I owe God a favor, He send me a angel 
 Niggas tried to kill me, He made sure I had a banger 
 Now I got to thank ya, proud to be a gangsta 
 Past the Beale Street, nigga fuck being famous 
 *Laugh* 
 Nigga I want the muthafucking money nigga 
 No attention pussy, gangsta shit nigga, CM5 
 It goes light, camera, action, Franklins, Grants, Jacksons 
 Money in my mattress, I'm tryna fuck a actress 
 My life like a movie, but I don't do no acting 
 I just keep it gangsta with my North Memphis accent 
 What it do pimp, what's up man, what's happenin' bruh, nothin' mane 
 How ya people be, gud mane, you knw errthng errthng 
 I just bought a white meat, it look like a polar bear 
 Baby mama touch ha toes, smack ha a$$, pull ha hair 
 4g out on wheels, I just call ha stop and stare 
 Daddies on da benz, and it remind me of a rocking chair 
 I got bitches errwhere, California, delaware 
 Haters in my peripheral and I can smell it in da air 
 Cool but ain't no cylinder, truth but yeah I'm feelin' her 
 99 point 9 percent, she fuckin' dem, she get in der
