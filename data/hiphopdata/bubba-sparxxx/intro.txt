(Feat. Big Rube) 
 Optimisum, about the faith of the people that have accepted of the mission of improbable, to become some particle, perged 
 By the discouage of suffering, anger, hate, religions and war, Its tought to explain, debate, or even explore, but I die 
 Straight to the core, 
 And explosion of intrespect so quiet, he can definalty, yet he can breath into the sins lounges into the most rempered 
 Thugg, 
 Tis a bull that has been thorugh the mudd with a point of the head of a heavy weight, from the cold detail of the hot 
 Reality of the butcher trap. to the grand Negro's flights of fancy from the astract mind of a hip hop super nerd, as long as 
 The truth is heard, 
 The truth must be spoken, my youth has been smokin' and drankin, drankin and smokin', a life like that may seem right, but 
 That ain't what the seem like, we ain't tight unless y'all tight, might bless me and all types, the goal is for all growns to 
 Be sat upon by ture Kings 
 All pretenders must fall into the phantoms of they own character fall, But as long as we attempt to tell ourselves, WE ARE 
 Not free 
 All in once say it, Bubba K now, Here to doubt, Where's today? 
 On the Grey Hound, sittin' in the back on top close to 8 pounds, 
 Run for a inniocent town that I can shake down, 
 Passed the Mississip, I swim in the great lakes now, 
 Made it this far, but I still can't escape now, Law ran in, 
 Back in the A town, and all I'm worth is all that ain't found, 
 My brother in Denver used to do a lil dirt, Maybe move with him, 
 I can do a lil work, Can't produce a walk, I do a lil smirk 
 Shop at Wal-Mart, I do shoes and a shirt, Tried to call mama, 
 She denied the call, She ain't smoke the sh**, I provide for y'all 
 Try to doze of with PM Tylenol, Jus move a lil piece, can't smile it off, 
 Y'all ain't free, Not yet free, Not yet free, Not yet free 
 Continue'n my voyage, In the Coldoraldo, Can't live life with my Doraldo, 
 This pill is hard for you to swallow, This pig sh** in which for you to wallow, 
 I'm posted up here, atleast until tomorrow, Get a pund of Buffalo Nik's that you can swallow 
 Only thing I'm holdin' is Pain, You can borrow, a whole pocket of change, 
 For your sorrow, Lotta Kat'z busted, but they can't find the hop, 
 That hustlin game gotta stop, On the open road, now is not the time to flock, 
 The buzz is formulating, Now it the time for Jimmy time to drop
