I might talk slow 
 But I'm feelin' fine 
 Cause them kuntry folks sho can ryme 
 Ain't got no ice 
 Cause without it I shine 
 And them kuntry folks sho can rhyme 
 Aw Hell 
 They done let me loose 
 And I'm doin' just what they thought I'd do 
 With a 5th of beam 
 And I ate a roll 
 N' I'm outta control 
 You should've brought me two 
 I started you 
 With them heated vocals 
 Don't you cross them weeded locals 
 My niece on wall street 
 With a balla's creep 
 N' it's all sweet 
 But'chall weep cause 
 Monday through 
 Sunday ooh 
 Y'all dummies too 
 Don't complain 
 Just know ya roll 
 Bad ass lil playa be going on 
 I sold my soul 
 For a "G" advance 
 A white, a quarter N' some peter pan 
 Now I'm broke again 
 With Duddy Ken 
 N' we out of gin 
 Gonna need a chance 
 Can't even dance 
 When I wil' at life 
 That time of night 
 Shinin' light 
 In the southern sky 
 Plus I'm high 
 Singing these tallboy's lullaby 
 I nullify your whole existence 
 In an instance 
 With no resistance 
 New Sparxxx? Bubba K 
 Don't know what to say 
 'Cause I smoked him senseless 
 So defenseless, a baby goose 
 On the discovery channel 
 At 3am 
 Life is some ol' country bum 
 Betcha wanted fun 
 But we ain't them 
 Got all blazed 
 And I got with' Duddy 
 Jumped in made the water muddy 
 These kuntry folks sure can rhyme 
 It's our time 
 Keep snoozing buddy 
 I might talk slow 
 But I'm feelin' fine 
 Cause them kuntry folks sho can ryme 
 Ain't got no ice 
 Cause without it I shine 
 And them kuntry folks sho can rhyme 
 I smoke homegrown and I drank cheap wine 
 Cause them kuntry folks sho can rhyme 
 You can tell me to change, but you'd be wastin your time 
 Cause them kuntry folks sho can rhyme 
 I ain't got no hoe 
 No blow, no dough 
 But got a lot of game to spit at your hoe 
 Fleetwood cadillac four-door 
 Steppin out the back with a cream Polo 
 The Mack tight 
 With a bang for the act rite 
 Boys on with my calls with my gat tight 
 Could'ntfind a phillie blunt better packed tight 
 Duddy Kin, blow like wind 
 Kuntry folks do kuntry things 
 Why y'all gotta be knocking me 
 I'm on the thang to the fifth a'grain 
 Gittin foul blitzed 
 Inna bought caprice 
 With a box of Sweets 
 Automatic from the static 
 Back seat beautiful chick with fat rabbits 
 We mark beats like a prodigy's habit 
 Yo style ain't shit 
 My swisher ain't fattest 
 Wanna get crunk 
 I'm a crank it up with ya 
 Wanna rap I'll git ya 
 D to the you double D Y Ken 
 Fakin rock-steady like the Wizards 
 With the gift to gab 
 Up in the lab 
 Choppin up track 
 Fo - fo mag (forty-four mag) 
 Playin' the Chrome 
 As the spot wears on 
 Polo down, versaci long 
 It's real folk 
 Take care and heed 
 Please don't make me say it twice 
 ATH GA baby 
 Y'all lil niggas better play it rite 
 Now what it is 
 Tell me what it gonna be 
 How you gonna do it 
 'Cause I'm down for dyin' 
 I'm a Georgia hog slash bulldog 
 Who might talk slow but shure can rhyme 
 I might talk slow 
 But I'm feelin' fine 
 Cause them kuntry folks sho can ryme 
 Ain't got no ice 
 Cause without it I shine 
 And them kuntry folks sho can rhyme 
 I smoke homegrown and I drank cheap wine 
 Cause them kuntry folks sho can rhyme 
 You can tell me to change, but you'd be wastin your time 
 Cause them kuntry folks sho can rhyme
