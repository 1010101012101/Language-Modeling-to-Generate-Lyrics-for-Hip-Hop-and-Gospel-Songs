I see you comin' 'round the bend 
 I just can't think of anything that can make me smile like you can 
 I see you comin' 'round the bend 
 I just can't think of anything that can make me smile like you can 
 There's a portrait of the south in the spirit of this song 
 Keep followin' the fiddle, it'll never steer you wrong 
 I've lived a lot of life so my innocence is blown 
 I'm headin to La Grange to replenish it at most 
 I've been across the globe and I've seen the worlds charm, 
 I taught 'em my slang, I didn't mean the world harm 
 It makes the soul smile to see what I've accomplished 
 I got up out the woods without a map or a compass 
 Life does change, and the sun does set 
 But my last breath ain't a one gust yet 
 As long as daddy know that his son does sweat 
 The same as he did for that uncut check 
 I'll sleep fine and a child will come 
 With the same last name as my poppa's son's 
 And you can rest assure that my son will know 
 That his Da-da wasn't a one-squeal show 
 One time for the New South's imminent progression 
 Ain't the good lord so generous with blessings 
 Whenever it was needed he'd send me some direction 
 I'd gaze up at the sky and take a minute for reflection 
 Is it baby balls, or a miniature erection 
 It makes you view change with degenerate dejection 
 Pay no nevermind to what the senators confession 
 He don't really mean it, he just winning his election 
 Nothing they can do to have prevented this obsession 
 With the vaccination of innocence infection 
 My heart is behind it if I hint it or suggest it 
 I finish with aggression but meant it with affection 
 To the common man at the end of his oppression 
 Welcome into church only meant for collection 
 And the common woman, genders no exception 
 Please keep providing with men in your reflection 
 There is no king for the throne I seat 
 All by myself, so alone I leap 
 For the young boy that's gone five weeks 
 He's only fourteen, but he's grown by me 
 'Cause he keeps the heat on and his little sister fed 
 With his knowledge of the land and the tools in the shed 
 He could be in school, but he chose this instead 
 No avenue he won't pursue for the bread 
 And who was there to speak for him but Bubba 
 He listens to his own, can't relate to none other 
 The product of a bad hand and a young mother 
 If daddy wasn't ready all it took was one rubber 
 To prevent the pain that his family done suffered 
 Thankfully his son is a real come-upper 
 'Cause it's gonna be something on the table come supper 
 There, the plight of my people is uncovered
