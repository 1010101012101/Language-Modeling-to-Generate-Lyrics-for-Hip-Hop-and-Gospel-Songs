First, you must travel a long deslolate road 
 This road you travel will seem like nowhere 
 But nowhere will turn into somewhere 
 Keep your head up Bubba, don't let nobody get ya down 
 Cause that road you travel will turn around 
 I've accepted every challenge and risen to all occasions 
 A country boy that got them most like Randy Moss, and Jason 
 Perhaps old Bubba's numerals don't fit in ya'lls equation 
 If your opinion coincides with that you ought to save them 
 'Cause to quote the greatest southern rapper, fuckin' period 
 Negative spirits, they only keep you down a myriad 
 Of Satan substances in my system still my wisdom 
 Is never once compromised, that's between God and I 
 Never once forgotten my manners 'cause my Mamma 
 Played in public housing, be polite in Alabama 
 But she had a different plan for me, and Russ, and Ginger 
 Thank the Lord for Jimmy Mathis, pops they must remember 
 How you held it down when them other clowns disappeared 
 Taught me how to set the scope, shoot and leave with the deer 
 And then he made me drink the blood to show me life was precious 
 The muddy road from nowhere to somewhere, here's my directions 
 I know what it's like to be nowhere 
 I know what it's like 
 I know what it's like to be nowhere 
 I know what it's like 
 Can you relate to 5 kids, 6 fishsticks on the plate? 
 Or writing Santa Claus, I guess he got the list too late 
 Or to catch the fish you bait the hook with little Dylan's poo-poo 
 On Mr. Allen's property, he catch you he will shoot you 
 Let these cats amuse you with comical depictions 
 But where I'm from being broke's no honorable affliction 
 Love some Jimmy Carter, but we never even voted 
 But slum is still slum, so you best believe we told it 
 Every firearm from AK's to 30 30's 
 And from live rocks to livestocks it pays the early birdies 
 Thus we worked the land like you work the block with yayo 
 But I choose keys over cattle 'cause the profit's way mo' 
 Might get locked away though, pedalin' them sno cones 
 So we keep it simplified with acres of that homegrown 
 Plus the finest shine that you can find this side of Memphis 
 From east nowhere to west somewhere, still the grind is endless 
 It all comes down to this, one last chance to advance 
 Beyond the second round of the big dance or my plans 
 Of being viewed as something special, more than just the other ones 
 Will vanish in the vapors of the players south has suffered from 
 The world's weight, plus a ton, restin' on my shoulders 
 But what the tractors deem a curse is blessed to the beholder 
 'Cause Eminem's incredible, but did I really have to say this 
 For y'all to leave my soul at rest and add me to your playlist? 
 But this time I may just, leap and clear that hurdle man 
 'Cause it's gonna be a million more, who knows if they'll be worth a damn? 
 Bubba K I surely am, with that silky kind of sound 
 Carson, tell your folks that I'll be early for 'em this time around 
 'Cause I've come too far for my own mistakes to quell me 
 'Cause looking back it's self inflicted wounds that ache and aile me 
 There's nothing they can tell me, leave me somewhere in a hurry 
 If I'm nowhere then that's nowhere and we'll be nowhere near a worry (okie dokie)
