I've been travelin' for some time (Some time, some time) 
 I've been travelin' for some time (Some time, some time) 
 On these long dark dusty roads (Dusty roads, dusty roads) 
 Lookin', there's nowhere to go 
 I guess I gotta hide away, far away 
 'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way 
 I gotta hide away, far away 
 'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way 
 Ay-ay-ay ay-ay-ay ay 
 I left out from mama's with my thumb in the wind 
 The leaves on the ground, winter's comin' again 
 Solid on the surface as I crumble within 
 But legends are made out of honorable men 
 So on the brink of death I still manage livin' life 
 'Cause so rarely in this world are these chances given twice 
 I indeed sold my soul, without glancing at the price 
 No instructions when I was handed this device 
 But with what I did give, I was more than generous 
 Put others over self on several instances 
 But I'm back on my feet without a hint of bitterness 
 And one way or another I shall have deliverance, so I say 
 I've been travelin' for some time 
 With my fishin' pole and my bottle of shine 
 On these long dark dusty roads 
 Lookin' there's nowhere to go 
 I guess I gotta hide away, far away 
 'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way 
 I gotta hide away, far away 
 'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way 
 Ay-ay-ay ay-ay-ay ay 
 Can you recall a time people loved you unconditionally? 
 Toast in the new south, "This one is for history" 
 Then I slipped fell and caused the numbers injury 
 Called the same people and it's: "Yo, you just missed them, B" 
 This the former look damnit Bubba you had it 
 Why'd you have to keep it Polo and New Balance? 
 Then they start to question whether you are true talent 
 Or just a redneck substance abuse addict 
 So then you hide away just to try to find your way 
 And now they're back to callin' you 200 times a day 
 I want all y'all to know, good or bad I'll remember it 
 At ten million sold in the name of my deliverance 
 I've been travelin' for some time 
 With my fishin' pole and my bottle of shine 
 On these long dark dusty roads 
 Lookin' there's nowhere to go 
 I guess I gotta hide away, far away 
 'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way 
 I gotta hide away, far away 
 'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way 
 Ay-ay-ay ay-ay-ay ay 
 Nothing could atone for the pain you've endured 
 The blood you've shed is still stained in your velour 
 You took your wealth and knowledge and gave it to the poor 
 Only to discover that your savior's manure 
 Acceptin' me as kin, put before your younger brother 
 They put a lot on us hardly knowin' one another 
 I honestly can say that over time I've come to love you 
 Now we are brothers and together no one can touch us 
 It haunts me with regret I never met your baby girl 
 She's an angel on your shoulder helpin' us to save the world 
 This musical marriage is no coincidence 
 Said my mama to me: "Baby, we shall have deliverance" 
 I've been travelin' for some time 
 With my fishin' pole and my bottle of shine 
 On these long dark dusty roads 
 Lookin' there's nowhere to go 
 I guess I gotta hide away, far away 
 'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way 
 I gotta hide away, far away 
 'Cause I gotta find a way to find my way 
 Ay-ay-ay ay-ay-ay ay
