Uh yeah 
 Good Lord 
 God have mercy on my soul 
 I love her, but ya never would know 
 There by the way I just let my girl go 
 Wit tears in her eyes 
 From the year and the lies 
 She backed on up and disappeared out the drive 
 Wait, hey, what can I say? 
 All we had means nothin' today 
 I did my thang and she did hers 
 But my crimes are a wee bit worse 
 And now I'm sittin' here all alone wit my gift 
 Just me and the dogs, & the home that we built 
 It was Andy's & hers even though Bubba bought it 
 But Bubba wouldn't leave just like her motha' called it 
 From the pink, on into the blue flames 
 God forgive me for causin' you pain 
 All it was ain't no more 
 'Cause my baby's gone and when it rains, it pours 
 She tried to tell me 
 I needed to be strong 
 I wasn't listenin' 
 And now my baby's gone 
 1 for the pleasure, 2 for the sin 
 3 for the family, we coulda been 
 Had I not been so concerned 
 With this life no spoken words 
 Couldn't begin to undo what's done 
 Deep within I know that you must run 
 Far away from the thought of my smile 
 And the broken dream of us walkin' that aisle 
 I first saw Betty and my nanny right charred 
 The press were the best and her pannies... My Lord 
 A fly country-girl just workin' them "Gets" 
 She's my queen, is a virgin I guess 
 But I ain't never ask & I ain't never tell 
 But Betty had the cash at the time I went to jail 
 And how did I reward her loyalty? 
 Let her walk in 2 see the joy on me 
 She tried to tell me 
 I needed to be strong 
 I wasn't listenin' 
 And now my baby's gone 
 It's been 6 months and still no word 
 I try 2 carry on like it still don't hurt 
 Hoes comin' round but I still won't flirt 
 Drankin' is worse, & the pills don't work 
 Last I heard, she was in Birmingham 
 Livin' wit, a good hard workin' man 
 And lookin' back on it, that's exactly what she wanted 
 Not a rebel, but a passion for tha moment 
 I live for the fiddle & a kick in the snare 
 I take my love & I stick it in there 
 Moved it gently and made this song 
 All because, my baby's gone 
 She tried to tell me 
 I needed to be strong 
 I wasn't listenin' 
 And now my baby's gone
