All the fellas nod their heads 
 All ladies fall in love or in lust either one 
 Baby I don't give a fuck, 
 Uh uh my tab's open yeah 
 My tab's open yeah 
 My tab's open yeah 
 My tab's open 
 (2x) 
 Yeah, they told me that I looked like I was 16 
 Then they eat their words when they see 2-2 on my ID 
 Baby faced and I'm all about my hygene 
 Gotta be a 10 or higher tryin' out for my team 
 Corks are flyin' and I'm drunk I need an IV 
 Model chicks are frivolous compared to girls that I see 
 Put your hands up if you fresh as I be 
 Packin clubs getting love's exactly what inspires me 
 Uh, so let's get fuckin' faded, 
 Lit up intoxicated, 
 Cause everyone gon' play it 
 Whether they love it or they hate it 
 I'm wit the unit find me in the club 
 Wit my BroBible boys 
 And Wizzy love his sluts 
 And I ain't one to brag 
 But tell me this ain't tough 
 I ain't Wyclef in December 
 Member we won't keep in touch, 
 All the fellas nod their heads 
 All the ladies fall in love or in lust either one 
 Baby I don't give a fuck 
 All the fellas nod their heads 
 All ladies fall in love or in lust either one 
 Baby I don't give a fuck 
 Uh uh my tab's open yeah 
 My tab's open yeah 
 My tab's open yeah 
 My tab's open 
 (2x) 
 I might be outside blowin' kush in the air 
 I used to be the Wiz till Khalifa said yeah 
 "Say Yeah" and stay there 
 Disappear wit Sam Adams I'm the fuckin' man 
 Notebook full of Rachel McAdam's 
 (Sheeitt guys, I wanna) Slam 
 So roll up the grams 
 Purple haze and all my cam 
 Killa and manilla 
 Ass and beach ball and getting tan 
 Rollin' wit' me getting tipsy wit my eighties fam 
 Don't be shy, Lose yourself but I ain't fuckin' Eminemmm 
 Shots for being here 
 Spillin drinks the way we dance, 
 I don't do the rockaway and I ain't pullin up my pants 
 The club anthem, genre is just handsome 
 Girls a stage 5 but when you call she doesn't answer 
 I'm up in Hartford chillin' wit my Bantams 
 These high maintenance chicks flip if they ain't pampered 
 Mindin my own bizzy Wizzy blinded by the cameras 
 Up in NYC the Bean is stepping in Atlanta 
 And you can leave me tab open, 
 I'm orderin' them X and them O's like I'm coaching 
 Quotient, party hard animal 
 Sittin' on a grand or two, 
 Throw it on my tab baby come and lemme sample you 
 And if you finna get it tipsy put your drinks up, 
 And if you finna get it tipsy put your drinks uuuuup 
 And you can leave my tab open 
 All the fellas nod their heads 
 All ladies fall in love or in lust either one 
 Baby I don't give a fuck, 
 Uh uh my tab's open yeah 
 My tab's open yeah 
 My tab's open yeah 
 My tab's open
