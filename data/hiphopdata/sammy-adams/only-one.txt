O-only one 
 O-only one... o-one 
 O-only one 
 You were so out of my league 
 Like I was lost for words 
 I couldn't even begin to speak right 
 Not to mention each night 
 Couldn't seem to spark that conversation 
 I kept stalling out, just waiting 
 At the green light (G-g-g-green light) 
 Push the clutch and finally broke the damn ice 
 Would have done it sooner had I knew you were intrigued by me 
 Had no idea, kept making these excuses 
 Now you're mine and I'm gon' prove it 
 I'm gon' prove it, I'm gon' prove it 
 Just had to say you're the only one 
 I can't deny it or stall any longer 
 Girl, you have done the impossible 
 Can't even lie, you're the only only only one 
 Oh 
 Girl, you're the only one 
 Oh oh 
 Girl, you're the only one 
 Oh 
 Girl, you're the only only only one 
 Girl, you would so be on that fly shit 
 And I can't even tell you or explain how wide my eyes get 
 When you walk in the room 
 It's hard to keep a friendly conversation 
 'Cause everyone's stuck on my chick 
 My my my my my my chick 
 Everyone look at my chick 
 She got the touch and moves to make me lose it 
 When we grinding, she make the room light up 
 But that's the last thing on her mind 
 Dude told me this would happen 
 I just thought that he was lying 
 Just had to say you're the only one 
 I can't deny it or stall any longer 
 Girl, you have done the impossible 
 Can't even lie, you're the only only only one 
 Oh 
 Girl, you're the only one 
 Oh 
 Girl, you're the only one 
 Oh 
 Girl, you're the only only only one 
 Oh 
 O-only one 
 Oh 
 O-only one o-one 
 O-only one 
 Crazy, never thought this would happen 
 But your love knocked me out 
 So before I write a flatten 
 Any question, thought, or doubt 
 And now I'm stuck deeper 
 Yup, and I swear it's true 
 But I can't go out and I can't look around 
 'Cause none of these girls compare to you 
 Just had to say you're the only one 
 I can't deny it or stall any longer 
 Girl you have done the impossible 
 Can't even lie, you're the only only only one 
 Oh 
 Girl, you're the only one 
 Oh oh 
 Girl, you're the only one 
 Oh 
 Girl, you're the only only only one
