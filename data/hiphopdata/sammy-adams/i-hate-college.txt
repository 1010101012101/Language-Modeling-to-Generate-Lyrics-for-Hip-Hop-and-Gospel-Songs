I hate college remix 
 I hate college but love all the parties 
 Finishing kegs and crushing bottles of bacardi 
 King or the class, id rather lay up with a hottie 
 Single doesn't mean I'm looking for somebody 
 Some say a drink blaze up a hardly 
 Puffin' PK, ski a little bit of mali 
 Am I out my mind most people say probably 
 But I've been on my grind puffin' nugs of that cali, collie 
 Pack my bag no parents didn't drop me off 
 I felt lost saw some herbs all wearin lacoste 
 Couple dudes in pinnies musta played lacrosse 
 Grabbed my duffle and I hustled through the dormitory doors 
 Of course my homie lived on the same floor 
 Soon to blow trees and down to pound coors 
 Down to pound whores, out of time though 
 Flow the better up to the whole town ooh 
 I hate college but love getting laid 
 Socialite swagga at night when the sun fades 
 Check my sun shades talking about upgrades 
 I can't see the haters no more I feel great 
 My eyes 20/20 so sunny when skies gray 
 I'm loved by the hunnies what more can I say 
 I'm just getting paid working like a slave 
 Between school athletics and music it's all day 
 So invite your friends to come play 
 Gave you the invite if you miss it don't complain 
 If you lucky get a kiss but miss no that's lame 
 Wanna get it in with wizzy, I'm your man 
 Sweating bullets no fan can contain 
 Short to pull it, but quick to amaze 
 I'm looking forward to tours in these planes 
 Seeing the cork popping from bottles of champagne 
 Dear lord taking your name in vain 
 All these sins in college I made 
 Well well my games off the chain 
 I last a couple hours tomorrow go insane 
 I hate college but love all the parties 
 Finishing kegs and crushing bottles of bacardi 
 King or the class, id rather lay up with a hottie 
 Single doesn't mean I'm looking for somebody 
 Some say a drink blaze up a hardly 
 Puffin' PK, ski a little bit of mali 
 Am I out my mind most people say probably 
 But I've been on my grind puffin' nugs of that cali, collie 
 I hate college but love all the parties 
 Finishing kegs and crushing bottles of bacardi 
 King or the class, id rather lay up with a hottie 
 Single doesn't mean I'm looking for somebody 
 Some say a drink blaze up a hardly 
 Puffin' PK, ski a little bit of mali 
 Am I out my mind most people say probably 
 But I've been on my grind puffin' nugs of that cali, collie 
 I can't sleep cause my god damn teach keeps assigning essays 
 Due at the end of each week 
 But little do they know I got a show by the beach 
 Watching girls flash wizzy way more than their teeth 
 They mad id rather learn flows than their lesson plans 
 But sit me down asking do you get the message sam 
 This is your life and you're in school to get right 
 Nah, music is my sun and you blocking my light 
 And if I don't blow get high and ignite 
 My life full of lines so my money gets nice 
 Well money's not happiness, you'll only get greedier 
 But shit it'd make life a whole lot easier 
 And my field gets a whole lot cheesier 
 Dominos bread but still getting meatier 
 But schools good for one thing I must add 
 And that's having a plethora of my vocab 
 Whole bags of verbs that I must grab 
 And throw down like a rich girls bar tab 
 I hate college but love all the parties 
 Finishing kegs and crushing bottles of bacardi 
 King or the class, id rather lay up with a hottie 
 Single doesn't mean I'm looking for somebody 
 Some say a drink blaze up a hardly 
 Puffin' PK, ski a little bit of mali 
 Am I out my mind most people say probably 
 But I've been on my grind puffin' nugs of that cali, collie 
 But I've been on my grind puffing nugs of that cali, cali
