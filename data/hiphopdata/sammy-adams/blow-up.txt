I've been workin' all night, man 
 What's a young kid gotta do to blow up? 
 This life's becoming somethin' I can't stand 
 Tell those people go home, I don't wanna grow up 
 I drank too much again last night, damn 
 Woke up with a hangover, time to roll up 
 Been workin' so hard, can't they understand? 
 So many kids like me, we just wanna blow up, blow up, blow up, blow up 
 Blow up, blow up 
 Yeah, we just wanna blow up 
 I just wanna prove a teacher wrong 
 Tell them that my own degree didn't help me write a song 
 Only payin' attention of the girl with the thong 
 And the skirt so short it's like she barely has a lawn 
 And uh, sick of hearin' 'bout my alcohol abuses and makin' up extravagant 
 Excuses, they're useless 
 So deuces to the classroom, welcome to your dreams 
 That made you without a major, homie, welcome to the team 
 I've been workin' all night, man 
 What's a young kid gotta do to blow up? 
 This life's becoming somethin' I can't stand 
 Tell those people go home, I don't wanna grow up 
 I drank too much again last night, damn 
 Woke up with a hangover, time to roll up 
 Been workin' so hard, can't they understand? 
 So many kids like me, we just wanna blow up, blow up, blow up, blow up, 
 Blow up, blow up 
 Yeah, we just wanna blow up 
 Waking up, weights become a trend 
 I roll over in the morning, random girl up in my bed 
 And I swear she was a cutie, she was lookin' like a ten 
 But the proof is in the puddin', I was obviously there 
 Obviously put it on a rich girl's dad 
 Just tryna make money like a rich girl dad 
 So deuces to the school life, fucking with a game 
 What made ya without a major, homie, look what I became 
 I've been workin' all night, man 
 What's a young kid gotta do to blow up? 
 This life's becoming somethin' I can't stand 
 Tell those people go home, I don't wanna grow up 
 I drank too much again last night, damn 
 Woke up with a hangover, time to roll up 
 Been workin' so hard, can't they understand? 
 So many kids like me, we just wanna blow up, blow up, blow up, blow up, 
 Blow up, blow up 
 Yeah, we just wanna blow up, blow up, blow up, blow up, blow up, blow up 
 Yeah we just wanna blow up 
 I've been workin' all night, man 
 What's a young kid gotta do to blow up? 
 This life's becoming somethin' I can't stand

 Blow up, blow up 
 Yeah, we just wanna blow up
