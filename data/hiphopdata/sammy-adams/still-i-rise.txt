G CURTIS (hook) 
 Still I rise to the top 
 Momma you should see me now 
 Lights so lavish 
 And I'm super star status 
 So high that I can't come down 
 So if you're with me with me with me 
 Put your hands up let's get this money money 
 And smile for the camera

 Speaking of rising I'm what's next 
 And do I feel entitled to your girlfriend yes 
 Girl wanna marry I'm just looking for some sex 
 Or some brain or some dome synonym gettin' that 
 Small girl skinnier than anyone I text 
 (Saddy?) baby tank to her knees lookin' like a dress 
 Others on the jack I ain't tryin' to impress 
 I'm just tryin' get my dance on 
 Come back to a girl no pants on 
 Look hes back and sammy got another dance song 
 Had to put my (man's on?) 
 G curtis in the booth with the beat that my engineer (matty?) could get his damn hands on 
 And then my life was what I planned for 
 Yaa you can catch me at the airport flyin first class 
 Know I'm on the grand tour 
 Never forgettin to smile for the camera

 (Another?) topic of discussion 
 You know that any where you go they'll be lookin' 
 Despite all the concerts that we be bookin 
 And all this effort that I be puttin' 
 Down is for you so stop trippin' 
 They know about the flights and resorts we hittin 
 They know how many checks that the boys been writtin 
 So stick to the dive and let them do the flippin 
 And ima stick to frees 'cause they better than my written 
 Chillin' by the pool kickin ls gettin' lifted 
 Took a chance so I knew I would never miss it 
 Now I have haters no time to dismiss them 
 Wakin' up (pos?) see the beach in my vision privacy on the door 
 (The beats?) is admission wont stop till the whole damn world listens 
 But that's gone take some time either you pop or you drop know the boy gone (stay?) 
 G curtis hook 
 Still I rise 
 Not just for the moment but the rest of my life 
 And all my dreams they constantly get turned into reality
