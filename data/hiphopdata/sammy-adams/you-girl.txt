The way you look is a problem [2x] 
 Yeah, the way you look I've been chasin, 
 Cause every time I hear your voice, 
 I feel my heart be start racing, honest 
 I'm yours for the takin', 
 Focus mine is just spacin', 
 Never find a replacement, 
 Let's just fly on vacations, 
 I want you girl, no mistaken, 
 Beauty never gets jealous, 
 'Cause she knows Sammy's a fella, 
 None of these girls can measure, 
 Up to what I got to tell ya, 
 Write this wifeys song, 
 Always loved you all along, 
 Wake up in the morning she's a tale that have no makeup on 
 The way you look is a problem 
 The way you're lookin' at me 
 The way you look is a problem 
 You do it to me, 
 The way you look is a problem 
 The way you're lookin' at me 
 The way you look is a problem, 
 You, yeah, you, yeah, you do it to me, 
 The way you do it to me 
 The way you look is a problem, 
 Cause every guy that sees you any where is sweating full throttle 
 You look better than models, 
 Forget hotels and the bottles, 
 We party till there's no tomorrow, 
 Listenin' to you, come follow, 
 Fill up in me with sallow, 
 Girl he didn't try college, still got some bills in the wallets 
 I'm yours, you're mine, we acknowledge, 
 Clear the rest for you, honest, 
 Wearin' sweats and tee's 
 Never seen nobody look so me 
 Smart, sexy, calm, reflective, 
 Glad I got you on my team, 
 The way you look is a problem, 
 The way you lookin' at me. 
 The way you look is a problem 
 You do it to me, 
 The way you look is a problem 
 The way you're lookin' at me 
 The way you look is a problem, 
 Yeah, you, yeah, you do it to me 
 The way you look is a problem 
 Yeah, you do it to me, 
 You really do it to me [13x] 
 The way you look is a problem 
 You you you do it to me, 
 You really do it to me [2x] 
 The way you look is a problem,

 You really do it to me [2x]
