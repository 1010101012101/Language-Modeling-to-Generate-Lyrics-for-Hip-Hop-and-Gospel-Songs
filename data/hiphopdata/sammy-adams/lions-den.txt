Take a step in my shoes 
 You can't held out 
 No chance 
 Bass up I don't give a fucken damn 
 I did it on my own 
 I don't need those hands 
 Beetchya mouth You gone lose those man 
 Never bring food to a lions den 
 Don't throw gas in the fire man 
 And I ain't gassin' this fire man 
 And I'm higher than 
 All of the above too fly to land 
 And flip with a flow 
 Thata make a dude in a wheelchair 
 Do a Michael Jackson dance 
 And I'm bout those Jackson's man 
 And from this rappin' stance 
 Dubstep house and electric fan 
 Up in en Chalan in the south of France 
 Our view is untouched 
 Wakin' up drunk gotta find my pants 
 Cell phones dead but I got a plan 
 Left phone dead I'm alive again 
 And I'm kickin' now 
 Plot is startin' to thicken now 
 Started this trend don't forget this clowns 
 Give me yo voice now I rip it out 
 Adrenalin shots in the heart in is 
 Overdosin is the hardest shit 
 Mike stain crumbles the filter rips 
 The preans blow 
 The speakers clip 
 Yeah yeah 
 And they wonder what my life is like 
 Married to the bass but the drums my wife 
 Mormon shit prolly right 
 Yup and I'm prolly right 
 About my future and what's insight 
 Or what's in store 
 No shoppin' light pedal to the floor 
 No stoppin' lights (stoppin' lights) 
 Yeah 
 And I'm so close to take off 
 I hope that this confidence never shake off shake off
