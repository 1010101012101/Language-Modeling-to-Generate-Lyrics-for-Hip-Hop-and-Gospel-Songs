In Vegas, yeah I drink JÃ¤ger 
 Throw bangers, get serenaded by ladies basically naked 
 It's crazy this life I take it 
 Everybody notice, white girls drink vodka sodas 
 Jack and cokes will get you open, tequila shots are the dopest 
 And I love it, the way you look so fine when I'm faded on my gin and tonic 
 But keep on getting persuaded that I wanna crack a Jameson 
 Invite all your lady friends, tell that bartender serve a motherfuckin' round again 
 Tell that bartender make that motherfucker stronger 
 I wanna go all night longer 
 A couple rounds going down like water 
 I wanna go all night longer 
 'Cause I do this every night ('Cause I do this every night) 
 I wanna do this every night (I wanna do this every night) 
 A couple rounds going down like water 
 I wanna go all night longer! 
 Negronis for all my homies 
 Tito's and chasers only 
 Whisk3y straight for the lonlies 
 Tequlias, red wine, and Stolies 
 Yeah I mix it, yeah I mix it 
 Have some beers before this liquor 
 Now I'm shit-faced at the bar 
 But my game's never been sicker 
 Shoot whiskey like a cowboy 
 Both guns go off then we wild boys 
 Got a light-skinned girl, sit tall boys 
 Jump around, make snag noise 
 Gun natty ice like a college kid 
 So many girls, come and grab one bitch 
 Toast to the bars, toast to the broads 
 Ha, no wonder why you love this shit! 
 Tell that bartender make that motherfucker stronger 
 I wanna go all night longer 
 A couple rounds going down like water 
 I wanna go all night longer 
 'Cause I do this every night 
 I wanna do this every night 
 A couple rounds going down like water 
 I wanna go all night longer! 
 My game's never been sicker 
 And I love it 
 My game's never been sicker 
 And I love it 
 My game's never been sicker 
 And I love it 
 My games' never been sicker 
 And I love it 
 Tell that bartender make that motherfucker stronger 
 I wanna go all night longer 
 A couple rounds going down like water 
 I wanna go all night longer 
 'Cause I do this every night 
 I wanna do this every night 
 A couple rounds going down like water 
 I wanna go all night longer!
