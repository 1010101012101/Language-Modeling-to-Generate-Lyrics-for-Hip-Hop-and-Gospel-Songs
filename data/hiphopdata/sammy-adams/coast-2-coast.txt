(Coast to coast, coast to coast) 
 Sammy Adams (Coast to Coast) 
 Coast to coast 
 Lifestyle switching, the illest up in the business 
 I'm hoping to make a killing 
 Get at me, get at me 
 Going coast to coast 
 Going coast to coast 
 We going coast to coast 
 Coast to coast 
 I'm not being mean, just being me 
 Costa, Sinatra, get on my team 
 Girls see me say "OMG" 
 He's back on flights going overseas 
 Not rich but aspire to be 
 Got a new Bentley but my swagger cheese 
 Rather be an act with a pound of trees 
 Never been down and you cannot see 
 Girl problems, you think you had some 
 Hit the beats, you won't have none 
 Big dream sale, you know platinum 
 Checks never deposit, just cash 'em 
 Summertime, triple eight vodka 
 Going out with my boys, looking proper 
 Used to be at the bottom with the other lobsters 
 Now I'm in the sky like birds and helicopters 
 Lifestyle switching, the illest up in the business 
 I'm hoping to make a killing 
 Get at me, get at me 
 Going coast to coast 
 Going coast to coast 
 We going coast to coast 
 Coast to coast (yeah) 
 On flights traveling to play songs 
 Two things, iPod and my Dre's on 
 Two things on my mind at the same time 
 Got to go both coasts on the same song 
 Gotta kill shit, no limit 
 I spit my heart out 'cause it's in this 
 The bridges, the beginning 
 Yeah something like the keys to my ignition 
 Come fly, yeah get a boarding pass 
 Too busy all day can't go to class 
 Still getting good grade, know I'm gonna pass 
 Hit the West Coast, I'm leaving Mass 
 Domestic, got a press kit 
 Side life girls impressed with 
 Girls strutting like they won't have sex with me 
 Yeah Right 
 Lifestyle switching, the illest up in the business 
 I'm hoping to make a killing 
 Get at me, get at me 
 Going coast to coast 
 Going coast to coast 
 We going coast to coast 
 Coast to coast
