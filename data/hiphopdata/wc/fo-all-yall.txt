{All y'all haters..} 
 [WC] Yeah... what's crackin' ni'a? 
 [WC] What's crackin' ni'a? 
 {All Y'all haters..} 
 [WC] Dub C... connected with my homeboy Cavi' 
 {All Y'all haters gon' talk to this..} 
 [WC] Y'all know what time it is 
 [WC] Straight out the womb homey 
 {All Y'all haters..} 
 [WC] I got a question; and it goes like this 
 (Wc) 
 The question at hand - is how should I bang these, slang these 
 Get 'em all to pullin out them hankies (uh-huh) 
 Flip a cup to this, click it, load it up and bust to this 
 Kick up dust to this, bust a you lay chalk to this to walk to this 
 Stick you, hit you with one whistle (ONE!) 
 It's that rag hot twist doe (uh-huh) anti-disco (uh-huh) 
 Long time, long see 
 But we goin' put this rider car back together 
 But gangster's how it's goin' be (ni'a!) 
 Stand up, nigga throw yo' hands up 
 Wipe it off, crack it open loc' and turn the can up 
 It's that G from the heart known for creepin' in the dark 
 And like Cyrus fool, I'm callin' a meetin' in the park (ni'a!) 
 In Broughams and khakis, hoppin' out the two-thousand-and-two Caddy 
 Loc' it's Dub see and Cavi 
 Cast it up, nigga smoke to this, gangstas dog and loc' to this 
 Real niggaz roll to this 
 All y'all haters goin' talk to this 
 And all real gangstas goin' walk to this 
 'Cause all true players goin' mack to this 
 Bump a rack to this, you know clap to this 
 'Cause some of y'all niggers can't play the game 
 'Cause some of y'all niggers can't do the thing 
 'Cause half of y'all niggers is scared of fame 
 We chase the dreams and fulfill the game 
 (Caviar) 
 Catch me in this MC or catch me in a double-are 
 G'd up and star (who is you?) Caviar 
 Cold ass nigga when it comes to my chippers 
 I'm nutty as a Snicker when it comes to legal tender 
 Currency collector, bring it back now selector 
 Catch a lick slippin and I'm quick to intercept her 
 Cash like a pass, mash to keep it comin' 
 Mr. Keep-A-Fat-Knot, I'm always up to somethin' 
 To get another tizzack, I bet the new llizzac 
 Be on chrome feet, TV's with beat 
 Matchin' (?) do's with the PS2's 
 Smokin' Kervorkian, sippin VS2 
 (Fo' sha') Big dollars, Impalas 
 Caviar got that bombay holla (ooh-ooh!) 
 Haters hate to this, and lowriders scrape to this 
 And all my real riders bounce rock skate to this 
 (Wc) 
 Ghetto glamour, rolled up with my thumb on my hammer (clik clak) 
 Lookin' like I'm dealin' with mo' snow than Santa 
 Chronic in my lungs nigga, ice on my neck 
 Twenty-two's on my truck, niggers after my deck (bump bump) 
 Dank I need it to mash but it's time to ride 
 And for my niggers incarcerated I grind and push this line (ni'a) 
 Sip malt liquor twist braids straight bankin' 
 G'd up and for all y'all I'm a stay swangin' 
 (Caviar) 
 Oh yeah, you know we stay on that gangsta page 
 Golf hats, Romeos, twelve gauge and braids 
 O.T. trips, cutties with Euro clips 
 Keep 'em smokin' Gladys Knight with the E on the Pip 
 Dip with new fits and whips so we can twist 
 Like Daytons, got my revenue stop hatin' 
 In the paint Cavi' go hard on why'all 
 Boss ballin' y'all, this for all y'all ni'a 
 {All why'all haters..} 
 [WC] What's crackin'? Dub see and Cavi
