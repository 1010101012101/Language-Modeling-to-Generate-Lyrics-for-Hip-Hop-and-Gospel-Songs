Feelin' good 
 Grippin' wood 
 Layin' upon the leather 
 Sunny weather 
 Rollin' with the windows down low 
 Hittin' kush 
 Niggas look 
 'Cause I'm drinkin' an' blazin' on that 
 Roll that 
 Motherfucker you know I'm blown 
 Dice on the mirror 
 Dub Shiest 
 Call me the power steerin' 
 Rollin' up on these hoes 
 Pure an' vanilla on my passenger seat 
 So I'm lookin' around 
 Lookin' out for po po's 
 Dirty as a piss test 
 Can't afford to get arrested 
 'Cause I know these niggas wanna stretch me out long 
 'Cause I'm a lench mob rider with triple xo wearin' v v s stones 
 Ooh shit this independent game got my ass sittin' on chrome 
 Dub c niggas thought it was over 'cause I was gone 
 But tell them motherfuckers I'm home! 
 I see you niggas lip movin around an movin around 
 Repeted to shoot me down because I got the top down 
 But I ain't givin' a damn I'm gettin' 'em in 
 Plu plus I can't hear you because I got the loud sounds 
 Reflection from the wet paint got 'em upset hatin' 
 'Cause I'm movin around town 
 But y'all ain't seen nothin' get right to my hog 
 Get to settle your ass to pound the ground 
 Fat stack 
 Joint fat 
 Matter of fact motherfucker I'm bout to clown 
 Front back black lac 
 And this black strap that have the choir singin' to you in the black gown 
 And I don't care what they say I'm a hustle get laid make money and lounge 
 Niggas thought it was over but see I just started 
 Tell them motherfuckers dubs back around!
