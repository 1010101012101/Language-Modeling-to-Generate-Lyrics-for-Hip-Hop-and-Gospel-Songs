It's been a minute that I've been sittin' up in this cell 
 Thinkin' of many ways that I can get paid escapin' jail 
 My life is like a football game, I'm movin' the chains 
 Tryin' to score so I could maneuver the Range 
 I hear police callin' my name, I ball in no lane 
 Tryin' to hit the wall, make the ghetto hall of fame 
 It's third and long, got a lot of yards to gain 
 I'm federal, youse a misdemeanor, you small change 
 It's that, S W A N G affiliate 
 From the penitentiary to the club, love I'm sendin' it 
 Turn me out and throw it up and get your boogie on 
 And let me see those fingers in the sky if you feelin' it 
 I'm sick and ain't no curin' me, maximum security 
 Can't stop my back bumper draggin' through your community 
 Process me, lock me down, level me hard kid 
 I still come out swingin' like Ron Artest, nigga ha ha 
 Is it the concrete or the walls? 
 Maybe it's the bars, might be the guards 
 Nigga this is lockdown, lock 'em down, lock 'em down 
 This is lockdown, lock 'em down, lock 'em down 
 Is it the concrete or the walls? 
 Maybe it's the bars, might be the guards 
 Nigga this is lockdown 
 I'm 'bout to whip yo' ass mayne, ha ha 
 Nigga the bang bang get up 
 Skip skippin' through the lane, swang, look at Dub 
 Swangin', still feelin' 'em all, I can't wait to get out 
 When I touch-down nigga, I'ma turn shit out 
 Looka there, biddy-by-by, buh-by-by beddy-bye nigga 
 Lights out, Dub and Nelly 'bout to shut the lights off 
 C-walkin' on the industry, spittin' with all my energy 
 Dedicated to my niggaz in the penitentiary 
 Ladies bounce to this, sip Cris', get drunk to this 
 Refs walks to this, dawgs thump to this 
 On my mind is my fetti, itchin' for the day 
 That I can parole and jack the nose on a Chevy 
 Three-wheel to the St. Lou' and connect with Nelly 
 Jump in the Escalade on them deuce-four Pirelli's, nigga 
 Money is freedom and freedom is cash 
 And anything between me and my freedom I'll whup an ass, ha ha 
 Is it the concrete or the walls? 
 Maybe it's the bars, might be the guards 
 Nigga this is lockdown, lock 'em down, lock 'em down 
 This is lockdown, lock 'em down, lock 'em down 
 Is it the concrete or the walls? 
 Maybe it's the bars, might be the guards 
 Nigga this is lockdown 
 I'm 'bout to whip yo' ass mayne, ha ha 
 Yeah, Dub stay chuckin' the pavement, I'm anti-general populated 
 Hood related, the industry most hated 
 'Cause I ball greedy and rhyme for mine, c'mon I'm willin' to die for mine 
 C'mon, while haters hate from the sideline 
 I'm like Fabolous, I make you 'Breathe' hard 
 Leavin' ya bleedin' and scarred, PC'd up on the sensitive knee guard 
 Dub Central ain't no surrender, spit for repetitive offenders 
 Facin' D.A.'s with public defenders nigga, ha ha 
 Is it the concrete or the walls? 
 Maybe it's the bars, might be the guards 
 Nigga this is lockdown, lock 'em down, lock 'em down 
 This is lockdown, lock 'em down, lock 'em down 
 Is it the concrete or the walls? 
 Maybe it's the bars, might be the guards 
 Nigga this is lockdown 
 I'm 'bout to whip yo' ass mayne, ha ha
