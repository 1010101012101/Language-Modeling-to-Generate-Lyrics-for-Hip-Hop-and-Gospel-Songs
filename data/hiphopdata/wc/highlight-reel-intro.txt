From the heart of South Central 
 Western Avenues finest 
 Years of grindin', bendin' corners on Daytonas 
 Started of with a low profile 
 Bellin' through ? with low security 
 Caught in a Maad Circle 
 Forced to curb serve 
 Westside Connected to gettin' his cheddar (ching! ching!) 
 C-Walk for more yards than O.J Simpson (skip, skip!) 
 Known to hit a hoe with quickness (bend over!) 
 And a hood rat (fuck you bitch! fuck you nigga!) 
 Samashin' all marks and wee-ass bustas (gun shots) 
 Bandana swangin' and skip-skipin' corporated 
 I present to you: Dub C the Ghetto Mothafuckin' Heisman 
 Bell on Dub, Bell on
