*Helicopter flies overhead* 
 (Cop) One of twenty, I'm behind the vehicle 
 And there goes the suspect, he saw us now 
 *Police siren* 
 *Chopper still flying around* 
 *Chains rustling* 
 Coolio, c'mon man, hurry up! 
 *Chopper makes another pass* 
 *Somebody whistles* 
 *Chains rustling* 
 *Siren stops* 
 (Cop) Back here 
 Police officer, come on out or I'ma send in the dog 
 Police officer, come on out or I'ma send in the dog 
 *Whispered "fuck em"* 
 Front em, front em! 
 (WC) 
 Yeah, beeaaaa! 
 Back up in the mutha-fucka 
 Crawlin up the letter to skanless 
 Givin' it up, straight holdin' my nuts 
 Dub-C nigga, still chanky as fuck 
 Fresh out, so fuck the world nigga 
 This is MAAD Circle to the fullest, everybody killa 
 Takin' it back to the days of drum loops 
 And lyrical skills, before niggaz got record deals 
 The dope game, when beats was the product 
 And only those with mic control made a profit 
 Before the shady ass contracts and restrictions 
 When niggaz true to this ruled the underground connection 
 Back to the days of hardcore 
 So lock your doors, here comes the MAAD Circle 
 "You know, we do whatever we do to survive"
