 Hey, nigga, gimme some of them water and chip's, shit

 Lock 'em up, nigga, lock 'em, bullshit 
 (Man)

 Get out there, nigga 
 These niggas ain't sho' ta riz-ayd, right 
 We gon' get in and get out 
 (Other man) 
 We on a roll, nigga 
 (Continues, indistinct) 
 (Verse 1: WC) 
 I'ma walk it down, now 
 Fuckin' wit deez out-a-town niggas 
 Got me watchin' up on my back and strappin' 
 Pistol packin' 
 Who ever thought dem fools would catch on 
 And we was sellin' rock while up in the back of the broll 
 See da plan was to make a transaction to match 
 Three calos, for under the zone, a hundred thousand cash 
 You know da deal, nigga you know da outcome 
 Dub C and C Mac take tha money 'n' run 
 (CJ Mac) 
 We gettin' close, hot as fuck 
 Burnin' up in his drive 
 Two pace, mirror checkin' doin' sixty-five 
 I seen the state patrol 5 times, swear to god 
 He make this stop, better have 9 lives 
 Nigga speak 
 (Man's Voice) 
 Where you at? 
 (CJ Mac) 
 Close nigga 
 You just have tha cash right so we can go's, nigga 
 I never tell no 
 Nigga when I'm comin' through his town 
 Set us up, get a crew, gun his town 
 (WC) 
 Fuck that, I dun dis shit befo' 
 After we twist deez niggas, we gon twist some mo' 
 (CJ Mac) 
 Out-a-town nigga havin' a pistal in hand 
 Whatcha paper, you fuckin' wit some jackets, player 
 Shit happens 
 (Chorus: CJ Mac) 
 Don't fuck wit a niggas cash 
 Niggas blast, when it come to cash 
 Niggas mash, on dat ass 
 Don't fuck wit a niggas cash 
 Niggas mash, on dat ass 
 Fo' a niggas cash, niggas blast 
 (WC second half overlaps) 
 (T'is da season to be janky falalalala lalalala) 
 (Verse 2: CJ Mac) 
 Hits J, sit straight, dey ain't even check 
 Swiss suitcase, jit 
 We ain't stop to count da cash, nigga 
 Shit, nigga, I remember 
 It was two a dem gas cans, was fulla straight heata 
 (WC) 
 Fake twista, took her ass back to da piz-ad 
 Sent some mo crystals back to da liz-ad 
 To make some mo trick-climbin'-blatant-nigga loot (wooh!) 
 'Cause baby need new shoes and daddy need a coupe 
 (CJ Mac) 
 Call my nigga, Fred, yo friend 
 He set up da link 
 Gave his ass ten-thousand, thanked him 'n' shit 
 Told him 'Shut the fuck up', niggas try sweating 
 And have to take his ass out there, he bound to wetting 
 (WC) 
 Uh huh, two months passed, I found his ass trashed out 
 Castrated on his porch, with his dick in his mouth 
 What the fuck? I know these niggas ain't here in L.A. 
 I went and grabbed the AK 'n' called my nigga CJ 
 {(Music stops, dial tone) inside ()= CJ Mac} 
 (What's crackin'?) Look it's on wit deez niggas (what?) 
 Hey CJ nigga I just found this nigga Fred fucked up 
 (Slow down, nigga) on the porch (Fred?) 
 Hey nigga it's goin' down 
 Hey nigga meet me at cho bitch spot, nigga (what?) 
 Fuck that, let's bring these in hea 
 Fuck these niggas! 
 (Verse 3: CJ Mac) 
 Goin' 110 on da 110, exit slow 
 Shit my stomach uptight, sumthin' ain't right (fuck that) 
 How da fuck they found where Fred stay 
 They ain't never been out there, hold up, what the fuck?! 
 (WC) 
 CJ, don't trip, nigga, dey just killed yo bitch 
 Left her bleedin' in the porch wit' screwdriver's in her head 
 Ramshacked the house, took the work and the money 
 (CJ Mac) 
 I could see that shit, but why the fuck you so bloody? 
 (WC) 
 They took the hundred thousand we stole plus two mo' (right, right) 
 And if I know that nigga Bo he checked a in mo {motel} 
 (CJ Mac) 
 Bo, hard nigga, who parted the game 
 You didn't know that motherfuckas name! 
 First you found Fred dead, then you found my bitch wit her wig split 
 Nigga I ain't stupid, you did that shit 
 (Gunshot) 
 Motherfucka shot me in my shoulda 
 Reached for my strap, and started dumpin' back 
 {Gunshots continue} 
 (WC) 
 Nigga, lifes a bitch and then you die 
 You only get one chance to check, nigga, trust no nigga 
 Shoulda known from the start, ain't no love in my heart 
 Fuck this 50-50 shit, this is where we depart 
 (CJ Mac) 
 I'll be damned if I let this nigga walk wit' da dough 
 Kill my hoe, boy, kill my hoe? 
 Five, fo' rounds, hit him twice, hit him in his stomach 
 See me vomit blood, 
 Nigga eat slugs! 
 {Gunshots continue} 
 (WC) 
 On my knees, I'ma see da bust back, fuck that 
 Somehow I managed, ta raise wit da wicked carriage 
 Ain't no rules to dis shit, we jackers 
 Ain't no love in this game, mothafucka, shit happens 
 I feel sorry, nigga 
 Just like every dog has his day, 
 Every loc get his nights 
 I'll be back at ya, my nigga (ain't no thang) 
 I can't believe yo ass did some shit like that to me, nigga 
 It ain't nothin' (hu, hu) 
 It ain't nothin' 
 It's goin' down 
 I'ma get that motherfucker 
 It's on!
