They call me dubcuda was the last name 
 Money in my lap doin' a buck in the fast lane 
 The passion of a husler I got it 
 And if it ain't about money I don't wanna talk about it 
 The passion of a husler I got it 
 And if it ain't about money I don't wanna talk about it 
 Now lemme see your fingers in the sky 
 And if you like money keep 'em up high 
 Stand up put your hands up 
 Show me what you all about 
 Real shit nigga 
 Yeah that's what I'm talkin' bout 
 Getting' it in out of the concrete boots 
 In a coupe a hundred ten 
 Blowin' like a flute 
 Fresh off of lockdown 
 Straight out the chute 
 Nigga down for whatever 
 Still all about the loot 
 The property of poverty 
 The looters of youth 
 Now it's denim on the leather 
 While removing the roof 
 The hog on the hog 
 With the "D's" on the Deuce 
 And you can blame it on the alcohol 
 The weed and the juice look. 
 Lolo (?) 
 Starter cap to the left of me 
 You know when I rep a "C" 
 Dub S to the death of me 
 Motherfuckers wasn't respectin' me 
 But I'm all up in your chest with heat 
 Givin' you sideline bitter niggas vasectomies 
 Till I rest in peace 
 Hustle the recipe 
 Your niggas a bitch baby 
 You need to sit next to me 
 Dub Cuda the bandana dangler 
 O T countin' dirty money with the hanky up 
 (?) You 
 Shake the (?) off you 
 Comin' again please 
 Gimme something to walk too 
 I can't leave see 
 For all of my niggas 
 Who don't wear tight jeans 
 Up they ass needs me 
 Went independent last CD 
 Still sold a shitload of records 
 No radio or TV 
 And I'm stickin to the program 
 Chucks on the concrete 
 While the Cadillac door slams 
 The "W" was my star symbol 
 My jams make niggas get down 
 Like barrels out of car windows 
 I'm a nut for Cheese and chuck T's 
 Addicted to big butt cheeks an weaves 
 Not a pop artist 
 But I'll pop they heezee 
 A branch of the same tree as 
 Pac and Eazy 
 Bumpin Jam Master Jay and Biggie 
 Iron on the stove 
 Shakin up the starch can 
 Sprayin my Dickies 
 Now who that nigga quick to shoot it 
 Cap at the truest 
 The closest to the streets to do it 
 Me 
 The D Fisher in this rap shit I'm a vet 
 And a (?) tied around the neezeck 
 Your future baby daddy I might be 
 You ain't never been with a nigga like me 
 Baby slide me you number 
 Ill call you later this weekend 
 I can't talk now 
 I'm on my way to rob the weed man 
 Love by a few hated by majurity 
 I'm the reason these rappers keep security 
 I go hard kick gears and jump cars 
 Chuckin up the hood 
 Three wheelin in your front yard 
 You niggas is temporary 
 Facebook Gangstas 
 I put faces on obituaries nigga
