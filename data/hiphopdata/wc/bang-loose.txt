Off that ignorant, belligerent, gorilla people like mugilla 
 From the chickens, liver, stanky rivers like kitty liver 
 Take my finger out your putang you smelly Funkadelic 
 With Funkadelic reteric for you relics 
 (The buffalo fake the nigga street sweeper) 
 The Grim Reaper's grim reaper 
 I'm a Don like Magic Juan, off that sauvignon 
 The game sprays out of my mouth like a can of Krylon 
 Riverside to Saigon, I'm killing each track I rhyme on 
 You had tights on like you had nylons on 
 Boogie banga funked out panty stainer 
 Ghetto enough to get TV reception with a coat hanger 
 Smell me 
 (It's the [unverified] words man) 
 Fake comedy for my accident done on purpose 
 About to set the fly one, down with the ghetto Hiesman 
 I'll serve niggaz in the third person don't even try it 
 Vaboom, he's back to putting in work 
 Vaboom, to make your neck and head jerk 
 Make 'em bang, bang, make 'em all move 
 Do the damn thing, my niggaz bang loose 
 Vaboom, he's back to putting in work 
 Vaboom, to make your neck and head jerk 
 Make 'em bang, bang, make 'em all move 
 Do the damn thing, my niggaz bang loose 
 Timber, Hawk, it's the big hawk 
 Ready to chalk 
 With the boom ping, ping 
 That make the Dre swing, swing 
 Flipped and slipped and clipped equipped the trigger 
 Hit, click, click, click, click, click 
 Nigga, dissa, stealer, scrilla 
 Did-a anybody kill her? I'm blasting 
 None of them like Danskin 
 Closing caskets chromed 
 Put my L.A. throat back on 
 It's back on and getting cheddar 
 In my ride with the blue feather, in linen 
 Strolling with the vengeance 
 And when I make that gun clap 
 Bitch, niggaz roll like pigeons 
 So if you claiming than brang it 
 And be about the drama 
 It's WC and I ain't your mama 
 Vaboom, he's back to putting in work 
 Vaboom, to make your neck and head jerk 
 Make 'em bang, bang, make 'em all move 
 Do the damn thing, my niggaz bang loose 
 Nigga make way for the big bomber 
 Mr. all night rider, original bang hand glider 
 Scuffing up Chucks swiftly 
 Looking for a spot launch that mini mat 
 And that's a hard hat 
 Do it till I get you, pistol grip whip you 
 Nigga, your pitiful, picture me back burner material 
 Never, scraped off serial numbers and brought [unverified] 
 Ditching your block when live while you work 
 'Cause it ain't no half repping 
 Either you riding or not, cock it or keep stepping 
 Come on, feel the breeze 
 What, y'all ain't know? I got a squad so cold 
 We freeze all area codes, they need this, real Gs 
 Critical thesis bound to break shit down to quarter pieces 
 For real, Devil, the boss under the Dub 
 Swanging, giving orders to chickens and thugs 
 It ain't no bitch in this industry that flow like me 
 Matter fact, it ain't to many niggaz that can see me 
 For sure I've been none to loc for way too long 
 Now the spot lights on me, so believe me its on 
 Its funny the way I'm hated, always underrated 
 But y'all hoes couldn't come with it if you masturbated 
 Niggaz wanna test me, I wish you would 
 Lyrics bang more harder than niggaz bang they hood 
 I come through unexpected like the in Vietnam grenades 
 Got so much heat I make the Devil run for shade 
 This ain't no game nigga, so don't fuck with T 
 Mess around and be headlining on Unsolved Mysteries 
 I got warrants for my arrest by the FBDs 
 For pushing off [unverified] trying to take these keys 
 A female fely in Burberry 
 Picking up money from the commissary 
 Don't fuck with Terry 
 Vaboom, he's back to putting in work 
 Vaboom, to make your neck and head jerk 
 Make 'em bang, bang, make 'em all move 
 Do the damn thing, my niggaz bang loose 
 Vaboom, he's back to putting in work 
 Vaboom, to make your neck and head jerk 
 Make 'em bang, bang, make 'em all move 
 Do the damn thing, my niggaz bang loose 
 Vaboom, he's back to putting in work 
 Vaboom, to make your neck and head jerk 
 Make 'em bang, bang, make 'em all move 
 Do the damn thing, my niggaz bang loose 
 Vaboom, he's back to putting in work 
 Vaboom, to make your neck and head jerk 
 Make 'em bang, bang, make 'em all move 
 Do the damn thing, my niggaz bang loose 
 WC, Dr. Stank, Devil, Lady T 
 Swang on, swang on
