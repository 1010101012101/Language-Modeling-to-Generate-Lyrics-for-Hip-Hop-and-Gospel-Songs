I got put on the set, smokin' Jimmy Jacks in a shack 
 With my nigga Coolio, got me to' the fuck back 
 High as a UFO, standin in my drawers 
 In the hall, talkin' to the walls 
 Now a nigga's spooked, umm 
 *Snagglepuss voice* Heavens to merkatroids, I'm looped! 
 I'm tripping! *normal voice* Nigga what do I see? 
 It's me, that nigga Dub C on the TV 
 Now I know I'm buzzed 
 'Cause I'm on the TV but the TV's unplugged 
 Damn, this shit is like the Twilight Zone 
 *Sings theme* Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na; I'm blowed! 
 Cause now I'm havin' illusions, illusions 
 Of me on channel eleven on a black and white tube and 
 Mack and the Gene are one of mine show 
 Hangin' with Sinead and they sippin on the four-oh 
 Now I know I'm trippin' *Martin Lawrence voice* Oh my goodness! 
 Let me change the TV and 
 Dizamn! Once again there I go 
 But this time it's channel thirteen on Arsenio 
 I'm smokin' a wet one on the couch 
 Givin' up a fat middle finger to the crowd 
 I'm faded, but not in a way in which you ever seen 
 Peep the side effects, yeah, I'm on the set 
 Chorus: *singers* 
 Asshole naked standin in front of the set; I'm wet 
 Ain't no escapin when yo' ass is wet; I'm wet 
 Look, look, way up in the sky everybody just 
 Look, look, and you'll find me flyin high 
 So there I was, standin in front of the set mesmerized 
 Kickin off the scenery right before me eyes 
 High as a motherfucker what was I to do? 
 Cause now the yerm has got me thinkin' I'm on channel two 
 Peep it -- bip-bip-bip like the bi-on-ic man I'm out of control 
 And now I see myself on Highway Patrol 
 Runnin' from the Feds tryin' to make my get away 
 But there's *singin* nowhere to run, ba-bay 
 And now exhausted from this drama I needed a rest 
 So I went on channel four so I can catch my breath 
 Now who's this after five minutes of bein there 
 I met this motherfucker named the Fresh Prince of Bel Air 
 Yeah this nigga was funny I must admit it 
 But his Uncle and his cousin Carlton was straight bitches 
 Them niggaz was cock blockin, talkin' bout killin' me 
 'Cause I told 'em I wanted to fuck the shit out of Hillary, ooh 
 Now what's a realer trip to fantasy, all I know 
 Is she was lookin' good sportin them t-shirt and panties, huh 
 I can't believe this shit, nigga I'm wet 
 Fuck tricks, my mind is playin' with dipsticks, I'm on the set 
 Still blowed from the chemicals I'm askin was it worth it 
 Cause like Slick Rick now Dub C is scared and I'm nervous 
 Cause now the TV's changin by itself, uh-oh danger 
 Cause now I see myself on channel nine on the Gladiators 
 I'm swingin' on a rope with a gauge 
 Boom, bang bang, you niggaz can't hang 
 Fuck a obstacle fool, I had them buff bitches runnin' 
 Mass confusion now I hear one-time comin' 
 So I swing to the exit, jumped off and jetted 
 Thank God mama kept the baby gat ready 
 I left all them bitches behind, till I got to channel fifty-two 
 And there I found myself on Good Times 
 Here was me and this nigga named J.J. 
 Out on a double date, just sippin on Kool-Aid 
 Now umm, ain't no need for me to pretenda 
 Like my date was all that like J.J.'s boo-boo Belinda 
 Yo, but she had a ass like Thelma, titties like Walona 
 Drunk off the Mad Dog I fucked around and boned her 
 Like J.J. the pussy was dy-no-mite though 
 I must admit the hoe had a mug as ugly as Flo' 
 I'm on tha set
