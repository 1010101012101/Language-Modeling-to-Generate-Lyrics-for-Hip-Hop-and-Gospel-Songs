This is Los Angeles, gang capital of the nation 
 Gang capital of the nation, this is Los Angeles 
 I was raised in the hood called what the fuck, nigga 
 W.C, ya better duck, nigga, fuck me, you're out of luck, nigga 
 This is Los Angeles, this is Los Angeles 
 I was raised in the hood called what the fuck, nigga 
 W.C, ya better duck, nigga, fuck me, you're out of luck, nigga 
 This is Los, this is Los Angeles 
 This shit don't stop, I'm still stackin' my cash 
 Out in the backyard with niggaz hidin' crack in they ass 
 It's gettin' kinda hot but I ain't leavin' the spot 
 ?'Cause don't nobody give a fuck if I'm eatin' or not, nigga 
 South Central, the gangbang capital 
 Where gun fire's ramped, the one time be gafflin' 
 Murder is a headline 
 Half an ounce of chronic is a misdemeanor 
 One gram of hard is fed' time 
 The name of the game is survival 
 Keep the thang on me like a preacher do a Bible 
 Fuck unity, ain't no motherfuckin' one love 
 Crips killin' Crips, nigga, Bloods killin' Bloods 
 Niggaz tellin', gotta stay outta dodge 
 On the stand y'all be singin' like Mary J. Blige 
 But I'ma stay cockin' my pistol 
 Goin' hard in the paint, niggaz can't stop my dribble 
 I was raised in the hood called what the fuck, nigga 
 W.C, ya better duck, nigga, fuck me, you're out of luck, nigga 
 This is Los Angeles, this is Los Angeles 
 I was raised in the hood called what the fuck, nigga 
 W.C, ya better duck, nigga, fuck me, you're out of luck, nigga 
 This is Los, this is Los Angeles 
 Gang capital of the nation, gang capital of the nation 
 This is Los Angeles, this is Los Angeles 
 I was raised in the hood called what the fuck, nigga 
 W.C, ya better duck, nigga, fuck me, you're out of luck, nigga 
 This is Los Angeles, this is Los Angeles 
 Out the belly of CA, hated by the D.A. 
 Skatin' in a '6-trey drinkin' on E&J 
 Everything will C okay 
 As I turn this bottle for my niggaz the old way 
 South Central L.A. where every day 
 The LAPD ghetto bird be yellin' freeze on the PA 
 You know they wanna lock us away, they laughin' away 
 While we killin' each other, the blacks and the eses 
 Fuck how much money you make, they gon' hate 
 Ballin' ass nigga, they gon' still treat ya like O.J. 
 The stereotypes don't go away 
 Little nigga, nice car, where the kilos lay? 
 The po-po wanna send us where the P.O.'s play 
 Thinkin' we all get our money the ?Carlito's Way? 
 Charles Manson can kill and live to see another day 
 But if you're black like Tookie they gon' steal you away 
 I was raised in the hood called what the fuck, nigga 
 W.C, ya better duck, nigga, fuck me, you're out of luck, nigga 
 This is Los Angeles, this is Los Angeles 
 I was raised in the hood called what the fuck, nigga 
 W.C, ya better duck, nigga, fuck me, you're out of luck, nigga 
 This is Los, this is Los Angeles
