Martin Luther King had more than a dream 
 He was out for social change and that sort of a thing 
 Tried to lead us to freedom, but before it would rain 
 He got blown away 
 He seen the problem and thought that he had to answer prolly 
 And that's the reason Huey started the Panther's party 
 Wasn't for Hoover he would be alive today 
 Bang, he got blown away 
 That man Clarence Smith was like a father to many 
 Was for the love cause the brother wasn't all for the penny 
 He said the black man was God and it costed him plenty 
 Was it the time or was no police officer friendly? 
 He birth the five percent nation, call him the true and living 
 And just for that you know they whooped him and threw him in prison 
 Wasn't for them he would be with us today 
 Bang, he got blown away 
 Marvin Gaye wrote a song called 
 What's Going On? 
 The label said no, but he convinced them to go along 
 He spoke of Vietnam and the shit that was going wrong 
 Tried to convince people that they needed to keep holding on 
 He sang 
 Mercy Mercy Me 
 , it felt like he was crying 
 He wanted to save the hood, they understood why he was trying 
 He took a stand and said what he had to say 
 Bang, he got blown away 
 2Pac Shakur was more than a rapper, more than an actor 
 It was more than the awards he was after 
 He tried to teach young, black people a better way 
 He got blown away 
 Hey, we gotta give it to him, Abraham Lincoln was honest 
 He was a racist, but he did what he said when he promised 
 He freed slaves, of course he was gonna path 
 He got blown away 
 John F. Kennedy fought for the people 
 White president, that wanted to see all of us equal 
 At least that was what he said when running for office to be to 
 But then he won and started doing more for the people 
 Assasin hit him with a bullet, (?) 
 I know a lot of y'all thinking 
 we wanna believe you 
 Black people prayed for JFK 
 But bang, he got blown away 
 Same way, Gosh, I can't forget Peter Tosh 
 If Bob Marley was Jigga then Tosh should be Nas 
 Peter was by right hand man, one hand washed 
 All of these brothers wanted more than to just to be loved 
 Killer with the guitar, but better up on the mic 
 Y'all remember the revolutinary shit that he would write? 
 Light it up, stand up, stand up for your right 
 Bang, he got blown away 
 You damn right 
 Martin Luther King had more than a dream 
 He was out for social change and that sort of a thing 
 Tried to lead us to freedom, but before it would rain 
 He got blown away 
 2Pac Shakur was more than a rapper, more than an actor 
 It was more than the awards he was after 
 He tried to teach young, black people a better way 
 He got blown away 
 Then it was Saigon, I brought you the greatest story 
 I know that they're watching me, I know that they're waiting for me 
 I just pray that y'all hear what I had to say 
 Before I get blown away
