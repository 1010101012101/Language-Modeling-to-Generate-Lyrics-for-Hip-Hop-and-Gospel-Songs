OK you, what's up? 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Your boy Saigon the man here, yeah, yeah! 
 Are you ready? 
 You niggas want it, you niggas get it 
 Hospital bed, nigga get admit it 
 My niggas got it, you niggas want it 
 Put a knife on your shirt, hurt on it! 
 Now the hottest beat of the year 
 Say yeah, yeah, my name is 
 Say yeah, yeah, rocking with Saigon this year 
 Say yeah yeah yeah! 
 Why you wanna make me go back on my bull job? 
 Even though I hang with the ganger those good guys 
 We don't get no man, like we're going in 
 I'mma hide your whole fam saying their goodbyes 
 I might be the wrong one to try to intimidate 
 It's some shooting and it's going on, I'mma participate 
 It's some you and it's going on, I'ma participate 
 'Cause I'm tired of seeing the designs on a dinner plate! 
 Be some food on it, lasagna inner state 
 To where I move on it, piranhas infiltrate 
 To feel like the day we see 
 The real shady bear, we're the ones crazy real 
 I ain't just the way you feel! 
 These are facts and you can even act 
 Or you could check my hood credit scores, legal facts 
 Yeah, this is what I suggest 
 If you're the truth, nigga, take the lie detector test, yeah! 
 You niggas want it, you niggas get it 
 Hospital bed, nigga get admit it 
 My niggas got it, you niggas want it 
 Put a knife on your shirt, hurt on it! 
 Now the hottest beat of the year 
 Say yeah, yeah, my name is 
 Say yeah, yeah, rocking with Saigon this year 
 Say yeah yeah yeah! 
 I'm a disciple, like I read ten Bibles 
 My will turned faster like a fucking spin cycle 
 And I ain't seen the Encyclopedia since high-school 
 Past the Ramadan I start fucking with ten riffles 
 Talking in your busting, discussing 
 Just like a... he was a mother fucker and fought crime 
 Daddy gave you a microphone and some talk time 
 You turned it into a porcupine, you ain't never walked the line! 
 Never walked a yard, just talking hard 
 You go to hell, you're send them round to support them gods 
 You're a fraud and the fraud in the presence of the law 
 Till my dogs started look like a snowish ball 
 I don't analyze, I'm cool and I'm casting charms 
 Smooth as a your music is gotta 
 A lot of, banging drums in the 
 The concept is nonsense, you're my God! 
 You niggas want it, you niggas get it 
 Hospital bed, nigga get admit it 
 My niggas got it, you niggas want it 
 Put a knife on your shirt, hurt on it! 
 Now the hottest beat of the year 
 Say yeah, yeah, my name is 
 Say yeah, yeah, rocking with Saigon this year 
 Say yeah yeah yeah!
