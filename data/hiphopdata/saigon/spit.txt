When I spit the room temperature change 
 I am what many consider to spit of a flame 
 When I spit the room temperature change 
 What niggas done did to the game, the shit is a shame 
 On your mark, get set, go, the rest flow was just SOSO 
 So when I'm the best? I guess so 
 I rhyme like my ribs and my stomach touching 
 I gang pound on these clowns like a hundred something 
 But hold the prophecy, but peak, the mold of my philosophy, D 
 Contemplate crime playing for keep 
 Elevating, reconstruct, got rhymes that erupt 
 From my brain, and then they drain right into a cup 
 From which I drink, then I think deeper, in them sink 
 From the dark hall of my skull, and then at your ink 
 That's a old school metaphorical phrase 
 I should shower and shave, but it's time to get paid 
 Get out of the way, I'm like a bat out of hell 
 How I'm wetting the hoes 
 You would swear a nigga just got out of jail 
 I'm a MC, slash stick up kid 
 Ask Pusha of all the shit I did 
 I ain't playing with them 
 We can discuss, discuss, plus lush, and what it does to us 
 I don't bust because I must, I bust because I love the rush 
 Plus checks, that I collect, bust TECs at suspects 
 Marks men and linen, we don't come off as rough necks 
 Sixty six and six, six, six, shit 
 The flow is fluently flowing like liquid 
 Even Jamaicans be saying my shit wicked 
 Y'all should believe me, I shouldn't have to kick shit 
 But look, you still lying in your raps 
 Always act like you're dying for some action 
 But we really know you not though, you not no 
 Vato, loco, you a twat bro, for sure 
 I'ma get rich or die trying like 50 
 Even if I got to do something that's quite risky 
 Pass me the Hen' bitch, I don't like whiskey 
 My guns snap, crackle, and pop, like Rice Krispies 
 I flex for your entire set 
 Rhyming in different dialects, fire TECs 
 Aim where your knee and your thigh connects 
 I, contracting like isometric hexicides, let's collide 
 Last nigga to try melecularide 
 Beside, I can see in your eyes you petrified 
 I'ma let you slide, without a lyrical hex apply 
 Next to Sai, niggas for sure, like a midget on a ball court 
 Come with that wack rap the store bought
