Oh, about 40 years ago, president nixon declared a war on drugs 
 To this day, wanna know what it was, look 
 How was it that they can win a war against ... 
 In the ghetto, losing a war against heroine 
 You don't believe me, look at some of the war veterans 
 Fought for the country and still can't afford medicine 
 President nixon declared a war on drugs 
 And ...was more like a war on us 
 The drug enforcement agents was given an occupation 
 Of making sure they inflating the prison population 
 So 35% ...black in expansion 
 They say crusaders might be results of the cracker but then the ... 
 I think it is, ... just big is 
 And not ... then I just beat it is 
 Today is easy to get blown than 40 years again 
 There's a war on drugs, then where did they go? 
 They found 2 terrorists all in a row 
 But can't find the sneaking drugs pass the border patrol 
 Do you expect me to believe this yo? 
 I mean the masses might do but me, no 
 You see some call it genocide, some call it hatred 
 I just call it something that everyone should relate to it 
 Let's keep it real, from town to sun don't shine 
 Let's keep it real, from town to ... around 
 Let's keep it real, it's like we're living in a town 
 We can't even make up our own mind 
 Let's keep it real, unless the change goes on 
 Let's keep it real, the ... same old song 
 Let's keep it real, if there's a war going drugs 
 We don't win till it bring no more 
 The rockefeller loss knocked a lot of fellows off 
 Trying to get a slice bread mozzarella sauce 
 I know none that won but hell of them lost 
 That old drug gain came with a hell of a cost 
 You ever stopped to think ... 
 Like where they turning this coco reef into something you could snore 
 How the hell is coming to new york? and every ghetto in America 
 Use the ... I mean you would think with all this counter-intelligence 
 They'd be smarter and harder ... 
 But they ain't got not even one intention to stopping it 
 Half of bit is politics half it's somebody profiting 
 The war on drugs is really the opposite 
 Should be called drugs on war, cause somebody getting they pockets hit 
 So that coco on my street and that weed on your street 
 Is only air, 'cause they eat off on war street 
 Let's keep it real, from town to sun don't shine 
 Let's keep it real, from town to ... around 
 Let's keep it real, it's like we're living in a town 
 We can't even make up our own mind 
 Let's keep it real, unless the change goes on 
 Let's keep it real, the ... same old song 
 Let's keep it real, if there's a war going drugs 
 We don't win till it bring no more 
 Clearly a lyricism not a conspiracy theory 
 I just need more ... to hear us 
 Clearly a lyricism not a conspiracy theory 
 I just need more ... to hear us 
 Yes, see, to go to war against something 
 Means to combat something, you know 
 I don't see no combat no fight against drugs in America 
 That has been a 35 billion on just say no 
 Why don't you put 35 billion into the schools 
 35 billion into our future, our children 
 Instead of building more prisons 
 Let's keep it real, from town to sun don't shine 
 Let's keep it real, from town to ... around 
 Let's keep it real, it's like we're living in a town 
 We can't even make up our own mind 
 Let's keep it real, unless the change goes on 
 Let's keep it real, the ... same old song 
 Let's keep it real, if there's a war going drugs 
 We don't win till it bring no more.
