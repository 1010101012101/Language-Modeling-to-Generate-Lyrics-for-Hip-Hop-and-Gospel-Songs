Nukka Saigon where'd you get that FLOW 
 You better get in there and get that DOUGH 
 All over the world, god, it's kids that KNOW 
 You remember in South click we did that SHOW 
 Only had one mic but ripped that THOUGH

 Lucky for him we didn't get that TOUGH

 My team will come through; pop you in the head 
 Them sixteens shot you now you up and dead 
 You act like you can't get hit with hot lead 
 I pop you in your cornrows; pop 'em in the dreads 
 Even niggaz with waves could get some of this 
 Saaamn

 Got niggaz only hatin' 'cause I'm getting' ripped 
 Now I got to chase them with the infrared 
 Saaamn 
 Come again; somebody gonna leave this party dead 
 Some boy gon' get shot and knocked in the head 
 I hit him with the head shot that rocked him to bed 
 Sprayed down, popped him, shot him then I fled 
 Saaamn 
 Come again 
 Saaamn
