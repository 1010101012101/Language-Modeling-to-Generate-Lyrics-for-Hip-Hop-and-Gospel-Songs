We try our best to survive, and keep our heads to the sky, it's that stress and depression goodbye 
 If we could just get it right, oh, oh 
 Do away with the club and the drug spots 
 Do away with the judge and the mug shots 
 Like we do away with the day when the sun drops 
 Clap your hands if you're tired of hearing gunshots 
 Or hear news about who got popped 
 By another black man or knocking a white cop 
 If I ain't there when they start ? the fight stop like oh 
 Slow your roller be collers the ice pop yo 
 We gotta start helping each other quit hurting each other 
 Money you have a nigger take it by murdering his mother 
 How does it feel being slave to a dollar bill? 
 Give your something I can bill, ya for real 
 Do away with all the Chinese restaurants 
 Do away with all the fakes Gloria Estefans 
 Clap your hands if you love it and just play shit 
 'Cause we don't just make songs, we make statements 
 We try our best to survive, and keep our heads to the sky, it's that stress and depression goodbye 
 If we could just get it right, oh ok 
 Do away with the hip hop police force, 
 Fuck the pigs, I was taught not to eat pork 
 Clap your hands if you ain't forget what you came for 
 Clap again and you're ready to see the change come 
 I used to live in the same slum as Mike Tyson and? 
 That's where the knuckle came from 
 Spring Valley had the same bond 
 We had to stay and hide 'cause we ain't had an income 
 Now they on the track like when the train come 
 Now ravages ? vip said so 
 And with my man ? you're just about to witness history 
 Clap, clap, clap your hands if you love it and just play shit 
 We try our best to survive, and keep our heads to the sky, it's that stress and depression goodbye 
 If we could just get it right, oh ok 
 We trying our best to survive, tell me when we're gonna get it right 
 Just keep our heads to the sky, it's that stress and depression goodbye 
 Oh ok, oh ok, oh ok, oh ok, oh ok 
 Oh ok, oh ok, oh ok, oh ok, oh ok 
 Tell me when we're gonna get it right 
 All we gotta do is keep our heads to the sky, I don't know you holler that ? hear me now, oh ok.
