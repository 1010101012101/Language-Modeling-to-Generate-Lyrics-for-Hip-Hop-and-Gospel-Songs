Don't let me be just another one 
 I always told myself, I'll be here when it's done 
 I know they don't believe but see we just begun 
 Momma, I'm growin' up, you gotta let me run 
 Gotta let me run, gotta let me run, let me run 
 Gotta let me run, gotta let me run, let me run 
 Gotta let me run, gotta let me run 
 Hey momma, I'm growin' up, you gotta let me run 
 I don't know but I gotta go, gotta go slow 
 But I gotta go 'cause I gotta grow 
 The flow got a nigga fall but I gotta show 
 That I got a lot mo' to go, I gotta blow 
 I won't take no, I don't think so 
 Hold on strong and no I won't let go 
 I'm almost there, I know I won't take long 
 I look in the rear and it's a long way home 
 D-d-don't let me be just another one 
 Momma, I'm growin' up, run that to your younger son 
 I'm the one when it's all said and done 
 Let it run to get a gun, the one that'll blow one 
 The one with the cold stare, niggas wanna go there 
 And oh yeah, I don't fear no one 
 Right now Twista-like style, quick to pipe down 
 When usually I fight back 
 Now I'm lookin' like wow, I came to learn 
 And my main concern to put the mic down 
 Wow, album number two 
 How comfortable, last one was for you 
 This one is for you and for frontin' niggas too 
 Comin' for you, now what you gon' do 
 Don't let me be just another one 
 I always told myself, I'll be here when it's done 
 I know they don't believe but see we just begun 
 Momma, I'm growin' up, you gotta let me run 
 Gotta let me run, gotta let me run, let me run 
 Gotta let me run, gotta let me run, let me run 
 Gotta let me run, gotta let me run 
 Hey momma, I'm growin' up, you gotta let me run 
 Run away with the moonlight 
 Third eye too bright for me to lose sight 
 And I'm only fuckin' with niggas that move right 
 Can't rock with a man pants too tight 
 You belong in the blue light 
 District, this prick take hoe nigga to new height 
 You in the strip club you might 
 Fear a nigga throwin' bread no food fight, right 
 Got a style like, Ike, the beat is my bitch 
 I'm wild for the night 
 Soup's upside your head when I spit it, another DV 
 Tell the Feds I did it 
 You on TV with a Red Sox fitted 
 Bet I won't go near Bedstuy with it 
 You know I'm just kiddin, earth is our turf 
 I'm the person to say that first in my verse 
 Don't let me be just another one 
 Just a statistic when I'm havin' so much fun 
 I'm in the boom-boom room with a poon-poon 
 Lips smellin' like perfume, wanna resume soon 
 Put your money where your mouth is 
 Bet you find your honey where my house is 
 Don't let me be just another one 
 I always told myself, I'll be here when it's done 
 I know they don't believe but see we just begun 
 Momma, I'm growin' up, you gotta let me run 
 Gotta let me run, gotta let me run, let me run 
 Gotta let me run, gotta let me run, let me run 
 Gotta let me run, gotta let me run 
 Hey momma, I'm growin' up, you gotta let me run 
 I don't know what I'm runnin' from 
 I don't know where I'm runnin' to 
 Seems your dreams are not comin' true 
 What the fuck are you gonna do 
 Stop it now, how dumb are you 
 How many lumps you want, one or two 
 Your future's right there in front of you 
 Whatever you do with it is up to you 
 Not for nothin' but who the fuck are you 
 Lot of other people are fucked up too 
 You ain't the only one who luck's up boo 
 Life's a bitch but you could fuck her too 
 Like I said Mami it's up to you 
 We don't do L's, W's 
 I'm not comfortable with number two 
 But it's up to you, it's up to you 
 Don't let me be just another one 
 I always told myself, I'll be here when it's done 
 I know they don't believe but see we just begun 
 Momma, I'm growin' up, you gotta let me run 
 Gotta let me run, gotta let me run, let me run 
 Gotta let me run, gotta let me run, let me run 
 Gotta let me run, gotta let me run 
 Hey momma, I'm growin' up, you gotta let me run
