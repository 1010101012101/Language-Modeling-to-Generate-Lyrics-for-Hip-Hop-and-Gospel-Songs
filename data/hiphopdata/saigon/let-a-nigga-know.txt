Let a Nigga Know 
 You wanna go to war bop 
 You wanna hear the 44 pop 
 You wanna see the gun that will make more than just your jaw drop 
 You wanna mess with the best, 
 But do you want to save your mama some stress 
 Nigga if you really want to test 
 I'll come and chop you in half 
 My click is cucku for cocoa they'll pop you and laugh 
 Wanna do gun play, Monday through Sunday 
 All 52 weeks of the year 
 Am I speaking clear? 
 You feel my flow 
 Even though I'm so political 
 Ain't another MC as gangsta as me 
 Shit I should be signed to Death Row 
 Uh-oh there go Saiyo 
 AK nine six at yo 5-0 
 Mind blow to your spinal 
 You're only a thug on vinyl 
 You soft, I know 
 And yo so is your rhyme flow 
 I'm the only rapper to ever shoot up the club 
 Me and my man Sean Paul 
 I pop up in a hot car 
 You hop up in the cop car 
 Then start telling the cops who's selling the rocks 
 And who the niggas on the block are 
 I put's it down 
 I know they like the way my shit sounds 
 Banging from the hood out to the hick towns 
 Everything I spit is hit bound 
 They on my shit now 
 Gotta get that money like Krazie, Lazie and Bizzy bone 
 Trying to take my from me 
 What kind of crazy shit is you on? 
 Let a kid act funny I'll lace him like when my kicks is on 
 We in the zone 
 We don't go to war with no sticks and stones 
 Wanna play Gin Rummy then shuffle the cards and deal 'em out 
 But if you get picked up then we trust that you not going to sqeal us out 
 I'm in the cut with a chick with a bigga but than Trina 
 And a better face than Jigga's slut 
 Nigga I'm Saigon you understand that? 
 I'm draped in firearms, you wanna wear that? 
 If you was now you not 
 You done fucked with the wrong one now you shot 
 I'll even give it to a cop mother fucker 
 You the chump I'm not mother fucker
