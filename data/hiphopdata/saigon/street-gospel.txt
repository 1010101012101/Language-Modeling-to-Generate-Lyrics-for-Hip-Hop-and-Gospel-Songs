(Intro) Do you think music has a meaning? 
 Oh, yeah, definitely, it's good to be more spiritual sooner than anything 
 Pretty soon I believe that we're gonna have to rely on music To, uh, like, get some peace of mind, or satisfaction, direction, actually, more so than politics. Uh huh, true shit 
 (Verse: Saigon) 
 Stop rappin' like a tough nigga 
 Start a label, now you actin' like you Puff, nigga?! 
 That'll get you stuffed, nigga 
 From gangsta to good guy, you gotta love it 
 If I had a heart, this would come from the bottom of it 
 Go 'head talk shit on the blog, dog, I can snuff it 
 But what's gon' happen is clappin', when we collide in public 
 You still conscious, but this time it's hostile 
 This time I'm hittin' these niggas with 
 Street gospel 
 Listen in with these ears, breathe me in with these nostrils 
 I am an evangelist, dream I'll be a realist 
 I speak the truth, preach to the streets 
 I'mma cut these words to the people I reach 
 Hit 'em with a lil bit of street gospel (The renegade's renaissance) 
 I've got the street gospel (The renegade's renaissance) 
 Do you want the street gospel? (Oh Lord, oh Lord) 
 Forgive me for the sins I've done 
 My cup runneth over with a lil bit of street Gospel 
 (Verse 2: Saigon) 
 Now that Chief Keef fly, they gon' kiss him good-bye 
 But look how many people had to die 
 Last night in my dream I seen Mr. Jimmy Iovine 
 All that I could do is ask him why (why) 
 I said Jimmy, who you got speakin' at these marketin' meetins'? 
 Why do poor people talk what they seeking? 
 When all they promotin' is sex and violence and this office is keepin' 
 They got the things to keep they heart from beatin' 
 Tellin' the king that sellin' drugs will make his life less hard 
 'Cause he's eatin' like sayin' he can get through all it by cheatin' 
 This is just not a reality, interscope's thrivin' 
 'Cause they givin' us swimming pools of liquor to dive in 
 Gave us N.W.A., Game, the gangbanging lane 
 And now this lil nigga (bang bang) 
 He says Saigon, you got it wrong I'm just the guy who make it possible 
 To hit 'em with a lil bit of street gospel 
 I've got the street gospel (The renegade's renaissance) 
 Do you want the street gospel? (The renegade's renaissance) 
 Forgive me for the sins I've done 
 My cup runneth over with a little bit of street gospel 
 (Verse 3: Saigon) 
 They said it was imperative for me to be negative 
 To make a name in the record biz and get the executives 
 To invest money in music that's infectin' the kids 
 In this ghetto their kids will neva live, but mine are subjected to this? 
 Nah, I can't see that happenin' 
 'Specially with a nigga like me that's rappin' 
 He who is not packin' is he that's lackin' 
 I'm ready, if you eva wanna see that action 
 Gotta understand I'm not the kind of a man 
 Who allow a dude to be rude and take some food outta my hand 
 Got a demonic plan, to show 'em that I'mma stand 
 My ground Try and bring me down, like trying drown Aquaman 
 And, I can't see that happenin' 
 'Specially with a nigga like me that's clappin' 
 Saigon graduated from your puppet to apostle 
 I was born to hit my people with 
 Street gospel 
 Listen in with these ears, breathe me in with these nostrils 
 I am an evangelist, dream I'll be a realist 
 I speak the truth, preach to the streets 
 I'mma cut these words to the people I reach 
 Hit 'em with a lil bit of street gospel (The renegade's renaissance) 
 I've got the street gospel (The renegade's renaissance) 
 Do you want the street gospel? (Oh Lord, oh Lord) 
 Forgive me for the sins I've done 
 My cup runneth over with a lil bit of street Gospel
