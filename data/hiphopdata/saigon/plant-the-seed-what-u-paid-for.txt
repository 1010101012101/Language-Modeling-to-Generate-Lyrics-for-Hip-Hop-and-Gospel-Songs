Hope you got what you paid for 
 Hope you got what you paid for 
 I ain't even gotta say more 
 Hope you got what you paid for 
 Hope you got what you paid for 
 Hope you got what you paid for 
 I know you got what you paid for 
 Everybody balling, everybody winning 
 Ain't nobody pull no more, everybody spending 
 Are we just caught in a world that we co pretending 
 Where pretend to be niggas to pretend to run up 
 The minute women are sinning, in a minute, this gets them to them infants 
 They morals becoming so inconsistent 
 Little boy with his wrist slit, little girl think this gripping is a bizness 
 That's cause our mother wasn't against it 
 Everybody getting it, everybody trappin 
 Who the heck is listening if everybody rapping 
 Kinda knew this was destined to happen 
 Rappers no realer than wrestlers who acting 
 And the message is backing 
 But once again Saigon bringing you the realest 
 If I ain't the illest, then we can talk about willest 
 Gsmt, just repeat after, matter of fact, after you 
 Hope you got what you paid for 
 Hope you got what you paid for 
 I ain't even gotta say more 
 Hope you got what you paid for 
 Hope you got what you paid for 
 Hope you got what you paid for 
 I know you got what you paid for 
 How you sposed to be the wildest when you got a stylist 
 Say that you really smoke whenever puffing out the chalice 
 Only clips you prolly fuck with is butcher of malice 
 I told you to cut the bullshit, now you full of the cow piss 
 How's this, I'm like money mayweather around round 6 
 Bout to start turning it up about this bitch 
 I'm too legit like Stanley barelle 
 I'ma die doing what I love, I'm the black tammy tarrel 
 Told buffy my nose stuffy, dog I can't even smell 
 'Cause I'm sick from doing this shit, but still they let me in jail 
 Tell baby I need avy, if not, then I'ma go holler at shady 
 One of these motherfucker is gonna pay me in gravy 
 In the best shape of my life, state the price make it nice 
 You can go on vacation twice 
 I'm telling you man, I'm worth every bit of that 80 million dollars 
 Hope you got what you paid for 
 Hope you got what you paid for 
 I ain't even gotta say more 
 Hope you got what you paid for 
 Hope you got what you paid for 
 Hope you got what you paid for 
 I know you got what you paid for 
 Before my daughter, before they bottled the water 
 We was flipping the bricks, see ...slide to the border 
 Come back with some shit out the size of rock of Gibraltar 
 Paper pussy power, paint in chronologically order 
 Coola got locked, product was getting shorter 
 We knew he do some time and then the cops would deport him 
 Fuck the feds have record him in the comfort in his own home 
 He would just live up and talk bindess on his own phone 
 We was on the home grown, he was blowing the hydro 
 I think it was hydro, how the fuck should I know? 
 I was ducking the 5o, tryina get the case gone 
 Went to Miami to see family 
 I wasn't tryina stay long, just to pick up enough yay to lay on 
 We still had enough to get way long 
 Hope you got what you paid for 
 Hope you got what you paid for 
 I ain't even gotta say more 
 Hope you got what you paid for 
 Hope you got what you paid for 
 Hope you got what you paid for 
 I know you got what you paid for
