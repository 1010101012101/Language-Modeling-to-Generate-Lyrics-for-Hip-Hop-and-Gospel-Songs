You've ever get the feeling 
 No matter what they do no matter what they say 
 You know you'll make it someday 
 You know the feeling when your back is up against the wall 
 People say they love you but you ain't convinced at all 
 Tell them they full of shittin they'll tell ya you insecure 
 Callin ya immature does that make sense to y'all? 
 You ever feel like it's you against the whole world? 
 Like everybody is scheming even your only girl 
 Your home boys seem to be counting your money 
 Tell 'em you ain't got it 'n' he lookin' at you funny 
 I'm feeling like I probably need ta either leave the game alone 
 Or either be the cheater bang the chrome 'n' get his hatin' on 
 How does the siagon story end how 
 You know what they sayin' for now 
 They'll say I'm killer 
 I feel I'm as high as I can be 
 N y'all ain't gon fly as high as me 
 I can't be no realaaa 
 Y'all ain't gon bring me down [repeats] 
 I can't be no realaa 
 Y'all ain't gonna bring me down 
 I'm too high but it's not from a drug 
 It's not from a drink not from a night at the club 
 It's not from abroad 
 It's not from what I coped from the deala 
 I would tell ya 
 But if I tell ya 
 Then I gotta kill ya 
 I've been around a lil while but I'm kinda scared 
 It's I'll like a vet that's still wet behind the ear 
 Some niggas look hard 
 But I don't feel a threat behind the steer 
 I'm looking for vics 
 N They could be volunteer 
 How dare somebody jump out the window ta try 'n' stop me 
 I wait for niggas then shoot 'em like I was a paparazzi 
 Manly's back system knockin' the mazzarati 
 I jump out the back 'n' turn ya block into nagasaki 
 I shouldn't have always make a issue with the pistol 
 Just to prove ta kids he's official tissue to the gristle 
 How does the siagon story end how 
 You know what they sayin' for now 
 Just say I'm killer 
 I feel I'm as high as I can be 
 N y'all ain't gon fly as high as me 
 I can't be no realaaa 
 Y'all ain't gon bring me down [repeats] 
 I can't be no realaa 
 Y'all ain't gonna bring me down 
 I'm too high but it's not from a drug 
 High on life, love 
 I'm from above 
 Just say I'm killer 
 I feel I'm as high as I can be 
 N y'all ain't gon fly as high as me 
 I can't be no realaaa 
 Y'all ain't gon bring me down [repeats] 
 I can't be no realaa 
 Y'all ain't gonna bring me down
