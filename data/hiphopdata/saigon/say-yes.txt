Yo, let's get it popping up in here yo 
 Yeah, there it go 
 Yeah, that's what I was lookin' for 
 Ayo, check it out son 
 I'm'ma show these cats how we do it 
 Before we did raps, we did kidnaps 
 Murders, muggings 
 Cousin, what you know about thugging? 
 When y'all niggas be out clubbing 
 I be deep in discussion tryin'a convince my little cousin not to blood in 
 Keep love for the Pen, Lucky got another buck in 
 Damn shame his motherfuckin' baby mother cluckin' 
 She be out with some coward that ain't about shit 
 Rumors say she put out quick for not even an outfit 
 Nowadays everybody riding or dying 
 We own this game, stop tryin'a buy in 
 Frontin' like you pop iron, stop lyin' 
 I'm a nigga so ill I punch Math and then drop Science 
 Saigon, the man with the 2 brains and 3 hearts 
 Swift enough to build with retards 
 Rap epitome, academically street smart 
 That ain't even the deep part 
 Me and my men end every fight that we start 
 If I ain't one of the lot of you, the stacks is unstoppable 
 On as long as Macks poppable, Cracks is choppable 
 If its logical, I'll bottle you, beat the shit outta you 
 Go to your Wake and beat shit outta whoever says "Bye" to you 
 This is what I would do, and if you was me? you'd bottle you too 
 'Cause you'd hate a bitch nigga like you 
 (Word to mother nigga, if you was me? 
 Nigga you'd fuckin' put 1 in your brain too nigga) 
 If you be living for death and don't be giving an eff 
 Then hit a pig in the vest and say yes (yes!) 
 If you be puffing the cess and laying sunk in the S 
 Then punch a punk in the chest and say yes (yes!) 
 If you a gangsta, hustla, thugsta that bust slugs 
 Nigga that don't trust hugs, and don't fuck with the bust thugs 
 Hold a blunt in your right and raise your left 
 You blessed so you should just say yes (yes!) 
 Ayo they trapped me in this violent environment 
 Blocks so hot, they need to fire the cops and hire some Firemen 
 Thugs get forced to early retirement 
 If they blaze your head, you made your bed, nigga, now lie in it 
 Need to stop denying it, pressure? you ain't applying it 
 1 nigga get mercked, look at you on some cryin' shit 
 Yeah I cry when I see my little nigga get murdered 
 Not 'cause he died, but 'cause the shit looked like it hurted 
 And I'm a nigga that's observant 
 I seen the bullet when it first hit, his face when it first split 
 And still no longer than 20 minutes later 
 I'm on the same block, same glock, with the same pen and paper 
 You analyze an innovator 
 S to the A to the I, show niggas what men are made of 
 Before you see me in The Source, you'll probably see me in the paper 
 For poppin' a cop or dockin' shots at a women raper 
 If you be living for death and don't be giving an eff 
 Then hit a pig in the vest and say yes (yes!) 
 If you be puffing the cess and laying sunk in the S 
 Then punch a punk in the chest and say yes (yes!) 
 If you a gangsta, hustla, thugsta that bust slugs 
 Nigga that don't trust hugs, and don't fuck with the bust thugs 
 Hold a blunt in your right and raise your left 
 You blessed so you should just say yes (yes!) 
 Ayo, you knew I'm better than you 
 Front, get a few embedded in you 
 Just 'cause I ain't have nothing better to do 
 See what this Beretta will do? 
 Turn a perfectly functioning human being to a veg-et-a-ble 
 We wettin' you from your head to your shoe 
 Yo the only attention you gon' need now is medical dude 
 And if the shotty pops you, fuckin' coroners will body box you 
 Call the guy that I bought to Karate chop you 
 To hell with ya crew, you be spittin' that shit that's not true 
 My niggas have lived and died for this shit since Junior High School 
 Funny how rappers talk out they ass but ain't about shit 
 So I set 'em on fire and use gas to put it out with 
 They cowards, talking bout they 'bout it, but we doubt it 
 The rhyme wont make you a thug, nor do fatigue outfits 
 We box, nigga we plots tempers shorter than Ewoks 
 Lace the Reeboks, chase you three blocks then *Gunshot noises* 
 Unload 33 shots biaaaaaaatch 
 Little faggot, stupid motherfuckers in the game 
 Yo yo, I rep for real niggas son 
 You know what type of niggas I rep 
 If you be living for death and don't be giving an eff 
 Then hit a pig in the vest and say yes (yes!) 
 If you be puffing the cess and laying sunk in the S 
 Then punch a punk in the chest and say yes (yes!) 
 If you a gangsta, hustla, thugsta that bust slugs 
 Nigga that don't trust hugs, and don't fuck with the bust thugs 
 Hold a blunt in your right and raise your left 
 You blessed so you should just say yes (yes!) 
 Word is bond son, I told y'all like 15 thousand years ago 
 That niggas was coming back for that shit 
 That real niggas was gonna re-emerge and take fake niggas off the map 
 And now that time is here baby, its 2k
