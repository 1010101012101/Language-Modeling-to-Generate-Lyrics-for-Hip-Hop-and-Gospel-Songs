Oh 
 Clap 
 Whoa, oh 
 We keep rising to the top 
 Whoa, oh 
 And keep eyes out for the cops 
 Whoa, oh 
 And that's what it gon' be 
 Whoa, oh 
 'Cause you ain't gon' stop me 
 They got you working two jobs, trying to make ends meet 
 You just trying to keep your kids off the street 
 You gotta believe it (Best believe it's a dream) 
 Oh, you better believe it (You too can achieve) 
 Uh, oh 
 They got you locked in a hole, 19 years old 
 10 years, no chance for parole 
 They better believe it (That's right, tell them again) 
 Oh, you better believe it (After that, tell a friend) 
 Whoa, oh 
 After the sunshine come the rain, after the fun time come the pain 
 I often wonder if it's gonna change 
 I caught a bad case of Smacking-Bitch-I-Itits (What happened?) 
 I came home, my wife got my daughter in shitty diapers (Damn) 
 The rice is still raw and the meat is still frozen in the freezer 
 I hate that I'm to close to her to leave her 
 Either I hit the street to do some pitching, knowing these dudes is snitching 
 Or die trying to make it as a musician 
 My living condition is not in the greatest condition (Nope) 
 And nah, I ain't bitching, I just gotta make a decision 
 Should I breeze past, hop out in a ski mask 
 Rob everything moving and cruise in a G-Class (Vroom) 
 But keep writing the heat that the street like it 
 Youngings is reciting my lyrics, so keep biting 
 Y'all niggas is thinking shit is easy, it's hard 
 One thing I know I'm a do is keep believing in God 
 Whoa, oh 
 We keep rising to the top 
 Whoa, oh 
 And keep eyes out for the cops 
 Whoa, oh 
 And that's what it gon' be 
 Whoa, oh 
 'Cause you ain't gon' stop me 
 They got you working two jobs, trying to make ends meet 
 You just trying to keep your kids off the street 
 You gotta believe it (Best believe it's a dream) 
 Oh, you better believe it (You too can achieve) 
 Uh, oh 
 They got you locked in a hole, 19 years old 
 10 years, no chance for parole 
 You better believe it (That's right, tell them again) 
 Oh, you better believe it (After that, tell a friend) 
 Whoa, oh 
 After the fast songs come the slow, after the sad songs come some more (More) 
 This is the life I have come to know 
 Police is in Marquis', Chevy Caprices stroll 
 The young, hood boogers idolize Keyshia Cole 
 The rap figures throwing money in the air like it's pizza dough 
 People in the hood ain't eating though (Though) 
 I tried to help the labels see the vision 
 But they lowered me to a subdivision, you gotta be fucking kidding 
 They'd rather me pretend to be something I'm not 
 I'm the new Public Enemy, I'm different than Yung Joc 
 And nah, I ain't dissing, this nigga's up in the Forbes 
 Shit, I ain't made a dollar trying to rap for the cause 
 But in these next four bars, I'll tell you about Maleverly Laws 
 They enforcing on North American shores 
 Dog, if they can have rifles on their farms 
 Then I don't see why they knocked T.I. for trying to bear arms 
 Whoa, oh 
 We keep rising to the top 
 Whoa, oh 
 And keep eyes out for the cops 
 Whoa, oh 
 And that's what it gon' be 
 Whoa, oh 
 'Cause you ain't gon' stop me 
 They got you working two jobs, trying to make ends meet 
 You just trying to keep your kids off the street 
 You gotta believe it (Best believe it's a dream) 
 Oh, you better believe it (You too can achieve) 
 Uh, oh 
 They got you locked in a hole, 19 years old 
 10 years, no chance for parole 
 They better believe it (That's right, tell them again) 
 Oh, you better believe it (After that, tell a friend) 
 Whoa, oh 
 Tell them wave at the artist, I feel like I'll make it regardless 
 Don't forget I'm the ex-con that made it the farthest (Yup) 
 Until the day that I lay with the martyrs 
 Or until the day I'm parlaying, playing with my sons and my daughters 
 I'mma remain the smartest, hardest working nigga in the business 
 Just Blaze, can I get a witness (Yessir) 
 See that they probably get it if I come out flop 
 Get dropped, go back to my block and get shot (Pop) 
 As they putting my body in that life-size Ziplock 
 Then you'll be saying "Damn, Giddy died for this hip-hop" 
 Or maybe it entail you to get locked 
 To another 20 in the rock for them to give me my props 
 Whatever the case may be 
 We do a census on who is the sickest lyricist, they say me 
 That's without a album out, y'all rated me 
 I drop one and I'mma bow out gracefully 
 Whoa, oh 
 We keep rising to the top 
 Whoa, oh 
 And keep eyes out for the cops 
 Whoa, oh 
 And that's what it gon' be 
 Whoa, oh 
 'Cause you ain't gon' stop me 
 They got you working two jobs, trying to make ends meet 
 You just trying to keep your kids off the street 
 You gotta believe it (Best believe it's a dream) 
 Oh, you better believe it (You too can achieve) 
 Uh, oh 
 They got you locked in a hole, 19 years old 
 10 years, no chance for parole 
 They better believe it (That's right, tell them again) 
 Oh, you better believe it (After that, tell a friend) 
 Whoa, oh 
 Keep, keep, keep rising 
 Whoa, oh 
 Keep, keep, keep rising 
 Whoa, oh 
 Keep, keep, keep rising 
 Whoa, oh 
 Keep, keep, keep rising 
 Whoa, oh 
 Woo!
