Oh, where I'm from it goes out every day 
 Oh, I still have dreams that there's up right away 
 Oh, everybody got a problem, make a couple dollars 
 Gotta spend that on a bottle, yeah 
 Oh, so you can drown all your troubles away 
 Oh, or you can be what you destined to be, aha 
 As long as I'm breathing 
 I'ma keep on living for the dream I believe in 
 Forever dreaming 
 Whether crack wars or rap tours, we walking the dogs with the track jars 
 Attack frauds, get tossed in the morgue, when I blast off 
 Past forward, my criminal past forwards, last captain my path crosses battle 
 That all, talking bad off, I mean really really bad off 
 Let's just say next time you see him, you gonna take your hat off 
 Look America, Saigon from the abandoned 
 I'm prolly wanna hurry your great, great, great grand kids 
 What the fuck I care about John Paul or Sir Francis 
 That's 2 original men as they dances around the answers 
 If we a micro in the macro of cracker the earth cancers 
 Is willing to against nature and suffer the circumstances 
 I got the intel, of a nigga that study stem cells 
 Shit will get ugly in hell, it's no way it can end well 
 Police got a nigga bar from my own hood 
 Sometimes I think I'm too smart for my own good 
 Oh, where I'm from it goes out every day 
 Oh, I still have dreams that there's up right away 
 Oh, everybody got a problem, make a couple dollars 
 Gotta spend that on a bottle, yeah 
 Oh, so you can drown all your troubles away 
 Oh, or you can be what you destined to be, aha 
 As long as I'm breathing, I'ma keep on living for the dream I believe in 
 Forever dreaming 
 I got a migraine, head throbbing, feeling pain 
 Pressing out, look on life, is that there's nothing else to gain 
 The old time I scold a gold mine I see I suppose 
 You telling all these hoes once the while I be 
 Flows forming my brain, heavy verses purgatory in vain 
 3 on the rock, 3 on parole, it's insane 
 My work is just getting greedier and greedier 
 Caught my partner black in his back, now we suffer from paraplegia 
 Gunning getting easier, cause in playing the game of crime 
 I aim the 9, emphasizing see my frame a mile 
 Sniffing cocaine, I got a rhyme for every gram 
 Tryina maintain, simply tryina stay in my lane 
 See money comes money goes, like a running nose 
 When you blow it, gone all your hunnies and foes 
 I never do it, I could be happier in bummy close 
 Well looky here joe, what do you know 
 Oh, where I'm from it goes out every day 
 Oh, I still have dreams that there's up right away 
 Oh, everybody got a problem, make a couple dollars 
 Gotta spend that on a bottle, yeah 
 Oh, so you can drown all your troubles away 
 Oh, or you can be what you destined to be, aha 
 As long as I'm breathing, I'ma keep on living for the dream I believe in 
 Forever dreaming 
 I got a daughter in California I hardly see 
 Even 3000 miles away she's a part of me 
 For her I spill every bit of blood in my artery 
 I kill a nigga whether he thug or be rnb 
 Until... tryina strengthen the bond with your mom 
 Even when she bugging, I keep calm 
 Even if I needed niggas to write for me 
 They couldn't 'cause they wouldn't believe in my life's story 
 Oh, where I'm from it goes out every day 
 Oh, I still have dreams that there's up right away 
 Oh, everybody got a problem, make a couple dollars 
 Gotta spend that on a bottle, yeah 
 Oh, so you can drown all your troubles away 
 Oh, or you can be what you destined to be, aha 
 As long as I'm breathing, I'ma keep on living for the dream I believe in 
 Forever dreaming
