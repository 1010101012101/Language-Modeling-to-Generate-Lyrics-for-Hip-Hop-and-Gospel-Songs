Yeah 
 It's the greatest story ever ever told 
 First time ever 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 I'mma let y'all motherfuckers know somethin' man 
 Change the game, it's a promise man 
 Let me get into this shit 
 Let me remember who I be 
 Check, the attribute is God be 
 Lord Supreme Allah helper to another God in need, indeed 
 I feed off a lot of the bullshit that tends to succeed 
 I was waiting, just went and took a minute to breathe 
 Even squeezed off a warning shot 
 Moose-knuckle to Brownsville, they impatiently waiting for your boy to drop 
 Lo and behold, Greatest Story Never Told 
 Chapter 1, Verse 1, the genesis of my scroll 
 Is realer than 9/11, I rhyme about lying reverends 
 While showing a total respect to the big guy in Heaven 
 I rap about politicians, how money's their acquisition 
 To get it they gotta keep us without a pot to piss in 
 Struggling to survive, 9-to-5 ain't making it 
 Turn on the TV all I see is celebs taking it 
 Feeling like they got all the bread but ain't breaking it 
 We're taking it, soon as I find the oven where they baking it 
 Whoa (the greatest story never told) 
 Whoa woo whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa (tell 'em again God, what it is) 
 Whoa woo whoa (look, it's the greatest story never told) 
 Whoa woo whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa (haha, yeah) 
 Whoa woo whoa (it's the greatest story never told) 
 Whoa woo whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa 
 Whoa woo 
 Check it, check 
 We was brought here to pick the cotton 
 Now we pickin' the music that massa listen to 
 The clothes in which he rockin' 
 We don't drive a hard bargain 
 All we want back is crack, some more gats 
 And some more of that bullshit rap 
 The crime rhyme is still black on black 
 And we need a leader like me to get us back on track 
 When y'all make them diss records do you know what you're doing to black community? 
 Market and promote the fact that we lack unity 
 Them white people look at you and laugh 
 You look like a porch monkey boy dancing for cash 
 Wanna get on a record and talk trash 
 See him at the awards and don't do shit but walk past 
 And that, that's something we call CRASH 
 Coward Rappers Acting So Hard, when they really just all ass 
 Abandoned nation on the warpath 
 And then we gotta bring some heat out 'cause we changing the forecast 
 Like whoa (greatest story never told) 
 Whoa woo whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa (it's the greatest story ever never) 
 Whoa woo whoa (it's the greatest story never told) 
 Whoa woo whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa (yeah) 
 Whoa woo whoa (it's the greatest story never told) 
 Whoa woo whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa (uh uh uh) 
 Whoa woo 
 Look, once again in the beginnin I was sinnin 
 Now I'm in the ninth inning of the game of life, grinnin 'cause I'm winnin' 
 I'll teach you how to rhyme, y'all only know how to riddle 
 Or peep the government wan' do me like Malcolm Little 
 They say that I'm a threat to the society 
 Since I put my thinking cap on and stop letting 'em fuckers lie to me 
 You gotta take it back to face the fact 
 These D's look at us as just another case of crack 
 If I bust a gun in the hood I get Attica or the cat 
 I bang a gat in Iraq I get a pat on the back 
 Best believe I know better than that 
 This a lesson for all my listeners, this shit ain't just regular rap 
 It's the greatest story that ever been spat 
 It's gon teach the hood and at the same time make my pockets elephant fat 
 Go ahead with all the irrelevant rap 
 Me and my nigga Just Blaze bring the true element back 
 It go whoa (it's the greatest story never told) 
 Whoa woo whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa 
 Whoa woo whoa (it's the greatest story never told) 
 Whoa woo whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa (yeah, y-yeah, y-yeah) 
 Whoa woo whoa (it's the greatest story never told) 
 Whoa woo whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa (oh, yeah) 
 Whoa woo (time, t-time for America to hear the truth) 
 Time, time, t-t-time 
 T-time, time, t-t-time 
 T-time, time, t-t-time-time 
 Time, time, t-t-t-time 
 Time, time, time, time, time, time 
 Time for America to hear THE TRUTH!
