Press reset muhfucka 
 Renegade renaissance 
 Another one 
 Do it my way 
 The yardfather returns 
 Back better than ever 
 I got a couple of deep questions for niggas that need lessons 
 The truth I deliver, you should consider these blessings 
 If you ain't heard Contraband 1 or part 2 
 You should Google those too so you can know how I do 
 First question for niggas that dwell north 
 What do y'all think the reason is New York fell off? 
 A - this new batch of niggas sounding like switch siders 
 B - New York DJs for being dick riders 
 C - fake thugs and shit pretend to be bloods and crips 
 D - all of the above, ya bish 
 Second question, I think I'll take some suggestions 
 What do we do about this rapper wearing a dress trend? 
 A - Show 'em how getting punched in the fuckin' eye feel 
 B - Just wait, cause soon they'll be wearing high heels 
 C - line 'em up but just provide 'em with a slaughter 
 D - or just admit the shit is Sodom and Gomorrah 
 The third question, a question I take seriously 
 I know you listening but I don't think that you hearing me 
 I ain't gonna front, shit kinda put some fear in me 
 Why people say all these tragedies a conspiracy? 
 A - 'cause they really using HAARP to control the weather 
 B - if a building's hit at the top, it would hold together 
 C - they been saying the world'll end since 2010 
 D - we remember the shit they did to the Indians 
 The fourth question's a question that's controversial 
 Why do these square rap groups wanna be crime circles? 
 All of the fake drug dealing, all of the fake murders 
 Which of these niggas set black people back the furthest 
 A - Trinidad James and All Gold Everything 
 B - Rick Ross, the officer that'll gang bang 
 C - 2 Chainz for really being a kid that has brains, or 
 D - the white man that's running the game 
 You never was a killer, you never bust a gun 
 You never held a spot down, was never on the run 
 You never was a OG, no it is not right 
 For you to say you was then live in the spotlight 
 You never was a killer, never bust a gun 
 Never held a spot down, was never on the run 
 You never was a OG, not it is not right 
 For you to say you was then live in the spotlight 
 I'll strike the mag, smack the fag that said I jacked his swag 
 Then smother the motherfucker with a Glad plastic bag 
 I'm a maniac, like I get around violence and chain react 
 Doctors still asking me, what the fuck you so angry at? 
 I don't even know but they say one out of every three 
 Black boys in the ghetto love metal and gun powder 
 Something about the bang, I like it a little louder 
 I'm just telling the truth, it ain't even something I'm proud of 
 You know you fucked, jury come back in less than an hour 
 How you deliberate a nigga fate in less than an hour 
 Money is power, then power is nothing 
 A verse from me is equal to like a hour discussion 
 Malcolm X was just 2Pac without the percussion 
 Who'da thought it would amounted to nothing 
 Till I came
