 Send my love to miss mary elizbeth sing 
 Been in and out of life everyday 
 So hang around for awhile for somewhere to stay 
 A reason season or a lifetime 
 Said its hard to let go but we got to 
 'Cause baby they done what they got to 
 They either here for a reason a season or a lifetime. 
 If you got somebody you love to see whether it's your brother 
 Your niece 
 Your mother 
 Your father 
 Your uncle don preach 
 A close friend who was stuck in the streets someone you tried to pull out but it seems the peaches kept duckin your reach 
 I'm hopin your hearts touched with this beat 
 Stevie Wonder see's black babies playin' 
 Not luggin the heat 
 There's a couple people I love to 6 feet 
 My grandmama my otha brother was killed on dem new jerz streets 
 My friend Ali got struck wit the train it was hard to bury the gaud body hardly nothin' remain 
 If I seem him again will I hear that laughter that left or is he still how he died with his head detached from his chest 
 Damn I can't call it fam rest in peace to stutterin Stan we stuck together like peanut butter and jam 
 That was my motherfuckin man he would always give me the upper hand now he layin under the land.
