Ain't nothin' stoppin' this murderin in Metropolis 
 I represent the poor profitless corner monopolipis 
 The pessimist outnumber the optimist on the block and it's 
 Coppers that got binoculars 'cause I can feel them watchin us 
 (Feel 'em watchin us) If only they knew what we had a pocket of 
 They probably swarm in without a warning pointin glocks at us 
 Get down... but this is gettin' us paid 
 So at a very tender age we learned the tricks of the trade 
 Copping coke to cooking it to chipping it with the blade 
 To baggin and pitchin to gettin' rid of it in a raid 
 Most of us would never get to stage, when its lawyers and bail 
 Hell we're happy to get stiffed in the cage 
 And it's crazy we be out here days upon days 
 Makin' just enough to get some licks, some kicks, and some haze 
 It's a damn shame we're placed in a no win situation 
 The party is in the pen and the blow is the invitation 
 Rikers Island you don't stop 
 Greenhaven all day you don't stop 
 Hold it down in Rahway you don't stop 
 You gotta strive in Elmira you don't stop 
 Sullivan, Kelso and you don't stop 
 All my peoples Auburn you don't stop 
 And last but not least for the sure shot 
 It's the abandoned nation 
 Teresea baby daddy got a bad habit of somking money up 
 She gettin' some strippin paper but saved enough for a tummy tuck 
 Little man hungry as fuck he only one-years-old 
 But knows he's unlcuky and such 
 As he grows he gets bitter now he acts up in class 
 He curses his teachers out tellin' them they can kiss his ass 
 Soon as he didn't pass his mama whoppin his ass 
 His pops is not around the boy is blocked down 
 (Blocked down) Not even 12 months later 
 He suckin on 40oz and pissin in elevators 
 Idolizin the guys with big rides that gettin' quick paper 
 And now he despises the shit-taker 
 He 13 goin' on 26 and a half 
 His only dream is to have bricks and a stash 
 Poppin' the clutch and hittin the gas, so he start dabblin 
 In the coke game pitchin for halves 
 Now he sittin' in a cell with an unpeculiar bail 
 He happened to make a sale to an unfamiliar male 
 Who was an undercover cop his photo is at the station 
 The party is in the pen and the blow is the invitation 
 Bayview and Clinton you don't stop 
 North Branch, Connely you don't stop 
 Hurstville, Bunker Hill you don't stop 
 Greenville, James River you don't stop 
 The party is in the pen and the government is promotin it 
 That's the reason I don't be believin in all this votin shit 
 They bring the coke in this bitch, ain't no poppy seeds 
 In the p's please, there's nothing but a whole lot of hopelessness 
 That's where all the focus is makin' sure all the blacks 
 Stay in the back the same place that uh, Scoliosis is 
 How can they lie with such compulsiveness we just sit around 
 Acting like this is how we supposed to live 
 Fuck outta here, I can swear in 'bout a year 
 I'll have these suckas in explainin why the hell they still got us here 
 This gettin' treated like shit still gettin' beat 
 With nightsticks, still attractin heat in my six 
 That's why we ride still drink Barcardi and the Gin 
 That's why you tryna invite me to the party in the pen 
 The body will get your ass up in the VIP 
 And the burner will get you in without showing your id 
 The coke that'll get you in especially if you cook it up 
 You RSVP to the party in the P 
 Enitentiary Saigitty I am the truth 
 I ain't one of these kids that lie to the youth, I'm living proof 
 Comstock in the house it don't stop

 And Attica come on you don't stop 
 Out in Greenhaven you don't stop 
 And what it do Rahway you don't stop

 What about Aronhill you don't stop 
 North Branch do it up you don't stop 
 Over in Connelly you don't stop

 Just Blaze on the beat he keeps it hot 
 And last but not least for the sure shot 
 It's the abandoned nation
