Hey, hey, it's Lil' Lay', Saigon, Just Blaze 
 Just out here in the field man, tryin' to make these ends meet 
 You know? Every time you look around it's some shit goin' down 
 Man, we tryin' to make a better way 
 Saigon, talk to 'em, man 
 Tell 'em how we tryin' to do this, man 
 Check, my heart is hurtin' and my soul's searchin' for a better way 
 I was born in Mooseknuckle where the kid was led astray 
 Then I moved to B.K., where I fell in love with guns 
 Fast forward six years later, I'm a felon on the run with one 
 Renegade Run was my alias 
 And even when I was whylin', the 'gon was a Don like Cornelius 
 Them hoes used to chase me around 
 None of my niggas surprised, I got models givin' face to me now 
 That I roll with a super producer plus keep the booth in a stupor 
 That's your dog? Call him for a meetin' is [Incomprehensible] 
 I try to put all of my trouble-makin' days behind me 
 But it seem like them fuckers always find some way to find me 
 I never thought that Just Blaze would sign me 
 (Why?) 
 'Cause he know that I fight a lot 
 And he know my Nation is rangin' grimy 
 (Yeah) 
 That's how I know that nigga for real 
 Took a chance on givin' a trill nigga a deal 
 Although we thuggin' and we be buggin' 
 We do be tryin' to find a better way 
 (Tryin' to find a better way) 
 And I'd be lyin' if I said 
 That we wasn't tryin' to keep our pockets paid 
 (Tryin' to keep our pockets, paid) 
 Although we grindin' we on the grind 
 And 'cause we tryin' to reach our destiny 
 (Tryin' to reach our destiny kid) 
 Whether it's hell 
 (It's hell) 
 Whether it's jail 
 (It's jail) 
 Or it's the cover of the double X L 
 I never thought rhymin' would help me climb the ladder of success 
 Niggas thought by now that I woulda took the Magnum to the chest 
 Or have the staggerin' arrest record for dabblin' in this 
 I knew I shouldn'ta been in since I'm fresh up out the pen 
 But N, O, spell 'No' sucka, I kill 'em with the flow, fucka 
 You could compare me to no other 
 I'm so scared of my temper, what if somebody try me? 
 What if I gotta prove that I still use the shotty? 
 Atlantic Records would dropped me, police is gon' knock me 
 Them bitches is gon' laugh at me, the haters is gon' party 
 And I'll be back in the yard 
 With old timers callin' me a goddamn fool for clappin' ratchets at y'all 
 I'm tellin' you this, so you know I'm fully aware 
 And very mindful that I will throw away my career 
 And let one of you little bitch niggas step in my square 
 And I'll show you, I keep the weapon right here, aiyyo Belly, come here 
 Although we thuggin' and we be buggin' 
 We do be tryin' to find a better way 
 (Tryin' to find a better way) 
 And I'd be lyin' if I said 
 That we wasn't tryin' to keep our pockets paid 
 (Tryin' to keep our pockets, paid) 
 Although we grindin' we on the grind 
 And 'cause we tryin' to reach our destiny 
 (Tryin' to reach our destiny kid) 
 Whether it's hell 
 (It's hell) 
 Whether it's jail 
 (It's jail) 
 Or it's the cover of the double X L 
 Check it, look 
 I'm hardly never low-key, so it's hard to get to know me 
 Got enemies in the street that's still targetin' to smoke me 
 It must make 'em sick to see me in [Incomprehensible] in the movie 
 Wait till they start spendin' money to market and promote me 
 Why would y'all wanna stop me? 
 I changed my life around, put the rifle down 
 Niggas still plottin' to Big and 'Pac me 
 But on the contrilly, I'm packin' the mac-milly 
 And clappin' at the first lil' faggot that act silly 
 It was my destiny to be here 
 I killed the mixtapes for three years, all original beats so be clear 
 And as fuckin' fate would have it 
 I got connected with the best producer in the world 
 So we can go in and make a classic 
 So when will you learn? I get deep without the Biblical terms 
 We livin' in hell with no physical burn 
 That's why a nigga tryin' to find a better way 
 And sayin' hi to tomorrow, goodbye to yesterday 
 Although we thuggin' and we be buggin' 
 We do be tryin' to find a better way 
 (Tryin' to find a better way) 
 And I'd be lyin' if I said 
 That we wasn't tryin' to keep our pockets paid 
 (Tryin' to keep our pockets, paid) 
 Although we grindin' we on the grind 
 And 'cause we tryin' to reach our destiny 
 (Tryin' to reach our destiny kid) 
 Whether it's hell 
 (It's hell) 
 Whether it's jail 
 (It's jail) 
 Or it's the cover of the double X L 
 Whether it's hell, whether it's jail 
 Or it's the cover of the XXL 
 Whether it's hell, whether it's jail 
 Or it's the cover of the XXL
