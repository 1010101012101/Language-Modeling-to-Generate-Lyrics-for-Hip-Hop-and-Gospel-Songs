So this how we putting it down, huh 
 All right, all right 
 She more than a friend, less than a lover 
 Why do I always question if I'm destined to fuck her 
 She talk about her man, I don't wanna hear it 
 I listen even know I really feel like interfering 
 She something like a sister, but sort of a sense 
 Have patience like me, papa for all her friends 
 Lately the conversation be more intense 
 I look her deep in the eye when she speaks so she more convinced 
 That I'm really caring bout what I'm hearing 
 When in reality, I'm just staring 
 Cause lil mama bad you heard me 
 If I fuck her, I'm a do it dirty, nah, I don't think you heard me 
 Me and mama got a lot of commonality 
 I don't wanna introduce her to abnormality 
 And if we ever did it, then I'd fuck it up 
 So I guess I'm just gonna have to suck it up 
 We got a relafriendship 
 See Shawty hit the scene, do our thing out 
 But I ain't trip 
 I am in a realfriendship 
 Lot of time wanna pull it to the side out 
 But I don't slip 
 We got a relafriendship 
 Shit I do it 5 years, we ain't never even kissed on the lips 
 I'm in a relafriendship, it's a relafriendship 
 A relafreindship, a relafriendship 
 She told me I could crush her, I introduced her to Usher 
 Jay Z, Beyonce, Blue Ivy and whata... 
 Michelle Obama, Janet Jackson and what's her name 
 You know the dame who sang the song about the busters 
 Always making me laugh, with that fat old ass 
 I wanna smash, but I had to pass 
 Told you last to had regret I don't see nothing good coming out of that aftermath 
 I remain neutral, keep it a half to half 
 'Cause we got a relafriendship 
 It's something I breathe, you just embrace this shit 
 Being friendly with benefits' a basic script 
 These here's deeper, it's a relafriendship 
 We could hold hands, but I won't tickle your palms 
 Kick it with your old man or go and pick up your mom 
 Think the shit is divine, what we have is so great 
 Oh wait, start to think you my soul mate 
 We got a relafriendship 
 See Shawty hit the scene, do our thing out 
 But I ain't trip 
 I am in a realfriendship 
 Lot of time wanna pull it to the side out 
 But I don't slip 
 We got a relafriendship 
 Shit I do it 5 years, we ain't never even kissed on the lips 
 I'm in a relafriendship, it's a relafriendship 
 A relafreindship, a relafriendship 
 I did lie in, if I ever said it never crossed my mind 
 I've been trying, consider what I'm feeling for you deep inside 
 But baby you the best, and our situation kinda making me depress 
 'Cause I'm curious of how your body look without the dress 
 I have to lose a friend over... it's just sex 
 But damn girl, I wonder what it's like to be your man, girl 
 But I have to say don't fuck being friends 
 It's just better in the end 
 To have you and to keep you than to hurt and leave you 
 We got a relafriendship
