From a boy to a man to a martyr it's the yard father 
 Party starter who can hit the bar harder 
 I order bacardi with dark lager 
 To chase that mess its burning my chest like hot lava 
 Verbally I'm a rotweiler you gon learn to respect me 
 'Cause you ain't even a doberman you a German shepard 
 And that's a back in the day dawg 
 Thugs now a days will cock it back pop a cap in your acorn 
 Fuck what they say in they songs 
 Gangstas don't stay long 
 They make a little noise then they gone 
 That's why I tell my sister I love her 
 Plus my mom and my brother 
 Live for today I know I'm not promised another (another) 
 You little punk mother fucker 
 I ain't got no love for you I got a slug for you 
 Its possible today can be your very last morning 
 Move your ass on and take this as a last warning 
 Don't d-d-d-don't don't do that 
 Don't don't d-don't don't do that 
 Don't d-d-d-don't don't do that 
 If you dot wanna get slapped don't do that 
 You been talkin' behind my back don't do that 
 Steady runnin' off at the trap don't do that 
 You want me to say something back don't do that 
 'Cause that shitll get you slapped shitll get you slapped 
 You been talkin' behind my back don't do that 
 Steady runnin' off at the trap don't do that 
 You want me to say something back don't do that 
 'Cause that shitll get you slapped shitll get you slapped 
 From a petty larcenist to armed robber it's the yardfather 
 I ain't jamaican but label me as the don darta 
 Let a nigga try to bomb bodda 
 I got a razor sharper than kareem abdul jabars barber 
 You you a disgrace to your pops in the pen 
 All he hearing about his son is the cops are his friends 
 Only time he heard your name in a sentence with gun 
 When you told and got a nigga sentence for one 
 He ain't raise you to be no bitch be no snitch 
 Spent to much time with your moms sweet old bitch 
 We was chewing you was suckin your chico stick 
 Shoulda sent your fairy ass to military class 
 Now your moms gettin' sceamed on by your dad 
 Like we shoulda had a daughter instead of a fag 
 This the last time I'm tellin' ya I swear its for sure 
 I shouldn't even ever have to say this no more 
 Don't d-d-d-don't don't do that 
 Don't don't d-don't don't do that 
 Don't d-d-d-don't don't do that 
 If you dot wanna get slapped don't do that 
 You been talkin' behind my back don't do that 
 Steady runnin' off at the trap don't do that 
 You want me to say something back don't do that 
 'Cause that shitll get you slapped shitll get you slapped 
 You been talkin' behind my back don't do that 
 Steady runnin' off at the trap don't do that 
 You want me to say something back don't do that 
 'Cause that shitll get you slapped shitll get you slapped 
 If you go to w w f u 
 Somebody put a slug in your brother then guess who 
 You know ima thug it but love it the best do 
 Not to many love it as rugid as S do 
 I'm so special 
 I'm what the fuck is lyricism 
 And I'm open to all your constructive criticism 
 Let a nigga step outa line 
 I get the tech and the 9 
 From up have a son truck and hit him with it 
 I told him not to do it 
 The nigga went and did it 
 He talkin' shit about me dawg now he feelin' a get it 
 And I'm ready to let the pop gun squirt 
 And sit hoppin g rockin' free saigon shirt 
 'Cause he be tryna play me is not gonna work 
 God made dirt now put some on top of this jerk 
 Don't d-d-d-don't don't do that 
 Don't don't d-don't don't do that 
 Don't d-d-d-don't don't do that 
 If you dot wanna get slapped don't do that 
 You been talkin' behind my back don't do that 
 Steady runnin' off at the trap don't do that 
 You want me to say something back don't do that 
 'Cause that shitll get you slapped shitll get you slapped 
 You been talkin' behind my back don't do that 
 Steady runnin' off at the trap don't do that 
 You want me to say something back don't do that 
 'Cause that shitll get you slapped shitll get you slapped 
 (I Know) 
 I know I know I know I know life got much more to offer me 
 And I know I know I know I know the system treats us unlawfully 
 And I know I know I know I know that a new day is yet to come 
 And I know that I'll be rite here with the nation 
 We live in a place where babies are born addicted to base 
 If you get arrested you likely to get kicked in your face 
 A lot of bitches is sick with the "H." 
 If you don't want the "I.V." think before you put your dick in her waist 
 It's a disgrace there's only one particular race 
 That got fucked ever since we got shipped to the states 
 Like being trapped in a pit full of snakes 
 They callin the coke dandruff the ghetto been inflicted with flakes 
 I listen to rap but wouldn't let my kid listen to that 
 'Cause if my kid listen to that then it's a wrap 
 Niggas replace wisdom with materialism 
 I use the rhythm to preach about imperialism 
 I get on it like martin luther king and do the damn thing 
 Far as snitching goin' like j-lo I can sing 
 But ill eat you like a planet wing 
 Lets pop a cop and then pop some champagne 
 I know I know I know I know life got much more to offer me 
 And I know I know I know I know the system treats us unlawfully 
 And I know I know I know I know that a new day is yet to come 
 And I know that I'll be rite here with the nation 
 They got drugs of all sorts coming through the airports 
 Only once every five years somebody get caught 
 How many lives must heroin cut short 
 How many us folk gotta grow up to smoke shoot sniff or snort 
 We no longer serving them dimes to manuever through turbulent times 
 Me and my niggas murdering rhymes 
 My life breathe like a verse in a song 
 So its in the quran word bond yah gonna worship the don 
 Convict since a young age face plastered on the front page 
 Picture me workin for minimum wage 
 I went in a rage packed the mack 10 and the gage 
 In the streets I seen more action that nicholas cage 
 Buck one for my niggas locked for using a gun 
 Buck two and them niggas that bucked Roo fuck you 
 Buck three for lucky 
 Buck four for all my dawgs up north let's get this jump off jumped off 
 I know I know I know I know life got much more to offer me 
 And I know I know I know I know the system treats us unlawfully 
 And I know I know I know I know that a new day is yet to come 
 And I know that I'll be rite here with the nation
