I've been down this road before 
 I'm still, I'm still who you're looking for 
 Oh, I've been looking for a place to hide 
 I feel, I feel your eyes 
 See right through my life 
 These young artist are striving 
 They say it's hard surviving 
 They only authorizing 
 That rap is disharmonizing 
 Tell them not to worry 
 Music, it's just modernizing 
 I beg to differ, 'cause if you look upon the horizon 
 You see a star is rising they go by the handle flying 
 He like a man of iron compared to these dandelions 
 And what come back? The underground? I been run that. 
 It just suck, I'm so stuck, to the street like a run flat 
 Though it only it take one track 
 To get you back, on my nutsack 
 I'm feeling like where the fuck is the love at 
 I might as well make it rain, sleet, snow, hail, in this dry spell. 
 I might as well come out of my shell, hell 
 Cause hip hop ain't been the same since I left it 
 Trying to be positive I guess was the wrong method. 
 Cause you can bring the dick to the pussy 
 But you can't make them F it. 
 And now look what I'm left with - this 
 I've been down this road before 
 I'm still, I'm still who you're looking for 
 Oh, I've been looking for a place to hide 
 I feel, I feel your eyes 
 See right through my life 
 We got a black prez 
 Still a lot of crackheads 
 My grandmother still can't afford her back meds 
 KRS already taught us about them black feds 
 They don't wanna see us live, should we act dead? 
 Then they wondering why niggas rocking that red 
 It's the only sensible lifestyle, day after day 
 Trying to put it in his head the more blood 
 Just wanna block the more blood gonna shed 
 Check check what he said 
 He said out here dodging the mortuary is not out of the ordinary 
 My people are so calm it is scary 
 And when we in the war why we ain't worried 
 Like a young G in the street 
 It's how I want to be buried 
 Look shorty you put it wrong 
 Here go a thinking cap, now put it on 
 With that mentality you're as good as gone 
 Lying there with the bystanders looking on 
 I ain't trying to clip your cone 
 I'm trying to put you on 
 I've been down this road before 
 I'm still, I'm still who you're looking for 
 Oh, I've been looking for a place to hide 
 I feel, I feel your eyes 
 See right through my life
