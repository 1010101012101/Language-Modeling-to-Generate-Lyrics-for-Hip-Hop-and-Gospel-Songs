I'm seeing you man you doing your thing 
 I see the new shoes, suits and a ring 
 Since when are you into bling? 
 A reverend's supposed to lead like Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King 
 You more like Pastor Offering 
 I'mma come down to your church, man 
 How much does it cost again? 
 God know a nigga struggling bad 
 He know a nigga probably need whatever he has 
 And you assist, I give you some ten percent 
 And I can hardly even pay my own rent 
 I got a old '94 Pontiac 
 You ride around this bitch in a new 'lac 
 You should be hitting us for some bread 
 But instead you hitting us in the head 
 For fives, tens, twenties, fifties, hundreds 
 Are you telling us this is what God wanted? 
 You ain't practicing what you preach 
 Nah you extorting us on the weekend 
 Rob stealing and running a game 
 Getting filthy rich in God's name 
 (Preacher) 
 You ain't practicing what you preach 
 Nah you extorting us on the weekend 
 Rob, stealing and running a game 
 What a shame, what a shame, what a shame 
 I'm seeing you man you doing it big 
 Both of your kids becoming the church jig 
 Wife rocking the five-thousand dollar wig 
 And she got a big rock on her hand 
 You running a scam 
 That we was fucking dependent on section eight 
 And always have something to put in the collection plate 
 It was always so strange it was odd 
 To see my mumma scratching up change to give it to God 
 I think we all know nobody's saying shit 
 You was using that to pay your card payments 
 We was mother fucking paying your mortgage 
 We was living in the projects 
 You know we couldn't afford it 
 But that's how you was on it 
 You would come to church and talk it 
 But I doubt you would walk it 
 You probably come to America and I seen that you whore it 
 Make me wanna just snatch you off of the pulpit 
 You ain't practicing what you preach 
 Nah you extorting us on the weekend 
 Rob stealing and running a game 
 Getting filthy rich in God's name 
 (Preacher) 
 You ain't practicing what you preach 
 Nah you extorting us on the weekend 
 Rob, stealing and running a game 
 What a shame, what a shame, what a shame 
 That politician ain't really a politician 
 He a (preacher) 
 We voted him in to be a leader 
 But he a (preacher) 
 Promises better living conditions 
 Soon as he gets the position, switches his disposition 
 It's the (preacher) 
 It's not only the guys in the church 
 But it's the (preacher) got a lot of swish words 
 How can we survive on this earth 
 When y'all come flood the ghetto with guns, drugs and legalize bottles of 
 Hurtin' jerkin 
 My cousin on per percent 
 He gave out a murder threat 
 They caught him, shot up his legs and those fuckers ain't working yet 
 Bloomberg banned cigarettes 
 Why you in man letting police men beat on niggas yet 
 Y'all know that the shit I'm saying is true 
 Ignoring it if it ain't pertaining to you 
 But if the (preacher) don't walk it like he talk it 
 Then dammit, dog on it, that nigga got some explaining to do 
 You ain't practicing what you preach 
 Nah you extorting us on the weekend 
 Rob stealing and running a game 
 Getting filthy rich in God's name 
 (Preacher) 
 You ain't practicing what you preach 
 Nah you extorting us on the weekend 
 Rob, stealing and running a game 
 What a shame, what a shame, what a shame 
 Know what I'm saying, no disrespect to nobody, y'all motherfuckers 
 Blaspheming ass ni--a, using the lord's name in vain nigga, don't do that 
 Shit. That niggas pimping the system, stop pimping the poor people man, 
 Help us out nigga, we need God for real 
 Now come on up here so Jesus can put you on a payment plan
