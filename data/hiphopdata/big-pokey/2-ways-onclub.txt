 (Chris Ward:) We normally don't make club songs 
 But tonight we came to make y'all uh... 
 Body rock playa wit ya 2-wayz on

 All dat animousity I got my game face on 
 And if your still standing in line your waitin too long

 U need to get in where you fit in, slide in the mix 
 Poke and Moe is in the 'Gator, I'm guidin' the 6 
 Hi-sidin' the trick on stage it'z still great love 
 Jumped out in the lot me and my nigga K-Love 
 10 candy cars behind all drops no tops 
 Half of 'em got chops the other half got hopz 
 Every body watchin' us like they workin wit the copz 
 'Cause when we rise to the occasion you know the party neva stopz so just (uh)

 Body rockin' by the bar like I'm losin my dome 
 Wanna take sumthin home bowlegged and sleep wit it 
 Dyme-piece or better I ain't scared to creep wit it 
 Star hoe, bad house and car hoe 
 When she walk her azz jump like a drop in the car show

 Don't catch a slug in the face, everybody in the place

 Blowin' Northen Light smoke out the top of the 'Lac 
 Wit the roof pushed back TV'z fallin'

 We valet, no way I just park at the front 
 Let 'em stare at the wrist wear while I spark up my blunt 
 Electro-techno gadgetz wit the J'z to match 
 Ice jeans make history 'cause my 2 way is attached
