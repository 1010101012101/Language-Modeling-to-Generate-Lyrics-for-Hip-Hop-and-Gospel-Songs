I got a new confession 
 I battle with depression 
 I got a lotta trust issues 
 I guess I feel neglected 
 I use that [?] 
 Now I'm just fucking reckless 
 I spend a lotta time 
 Just tryna be accepted 
 I canceled all my shows 
 I burned all my clothes 
 I'm going out my mind 
 I just need to be alone 
 Like the snow, like the snow 
 In a avalanche 
 It just rolls and it rolls 
 'Til it finally lands 
 It rolls 
 Cash, money, hoes 
 That's all a nigga knows 
 Cash, money, hoes 
 That's all a nigga knows 
 I'm sick of your suggestions 
 I hate the stupid questions 
 Just wanna be myself 
 I hate to be corrected 
 They say I need a ration 
 They say I ain't in a restin' 
 If you lookin' for a friend 
 Then you in the wrong profession 
 I cut off all my hoes 
 I smoke up all my drough 
 When you going through some shit 
 You just hope nobody knows 
 Like the snow, like the snow 
 In a avalanche 
 It just rolls and it rolls 
 'Til it finally lands 
 It rolls 
 Cash, money, hoes 
 That's all a nigga knows 
 Cash, money, hoes 
 That's all a nigga knows 
 Like the snow, like the snow 
 It just rolls and it rolls 
 It rolls 
 Cash, money, hoes 
 That's all a nigga knows 
 Cash, money, hoes 
 That's all a nigga knows
