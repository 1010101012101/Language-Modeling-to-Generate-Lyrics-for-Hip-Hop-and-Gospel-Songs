(Chorus - B.o.B) 
 Put me on anything, still I bet I bust 
 Put me anywhere on the map, I bet I bust 
 This is what I does so, please don't gas me up 
 Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud 
 I bet I bust 
 I bet I bust (I, I) 
 I bet I bust 
 I bet I, I bet I, (bust) 
 I bet I bust 
 I bet I bust (I, I) 
 Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud I bet I bust 
 (B.o.B) 
 Bust, bust, bu-bu-bust 
 Yeah, on bud, bet I bust 
 That's just what I does, yes 
 Put me anywhere on the map with a backpack strapped 
 Still I bet I bust 
 Bet I flow 
 Bet I rip this beat 
 Bet I feel that soul 
 Bet I go 
 Bet I bench these niggas like Ray, sit down bro! 
 Bet I know, everything about this game 
 Bet I know my role 
 Plus they know when I come to the court this is my sport 
 B dot o, B 
 So, bet I go 
 Bet I'm on a brand new plane 
 Bet I'm in a whole different zone 
 I ain't really from this place 
 So I'm up all night long 
 Really I'm in outer space 
 Really I ain't got no home 
 Really I'm a saint 
 Bet I'm blown, 
 Bet I'm thrown, up to the sky 
 Over the ocean 
 So I fly wherever I'm goin' 
 When I'm by, bet I'm focused 
 If it's five, you can bet I roll it 
 Matter of fact, you can bet I bust 
 (Chorus - B.o.B) 
 Put me on anything, still I bet I bust 
 Put me anywhere on the map, I bet I bust 
 This is what I does so, please don't gas me up 
 Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud 
 I bet I bust 
 I bet I bust (I, I) 
 I bet I bust 
 I bet I, I bet I, (bust) 
 I bet I bust 
 I bet I bust (I, I) 
 Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud I bet I bust 
 (T.I.) 
 Yeah, hey, grab a brown front and center, the king fittin' to enter (okay) 
 The room when the boom hit the booth, I deliver 
 The hottest, you probably too small to acknowledge, you 
 Impossible to copy like what everybody try to do 
 We cool as some dudes on them waves out in Malibu 
 I'm fallin' hard baseline, ball through the alley-oop (bang!) 
 Comin' through this thang like James, in the air off the rim I hang 
 Nigga, this king, pretend you forgot my name if you wanna 
 Imma come hard like a boner, don't I 
 Make a nigga wanna rebound, turned up all the way, we amped 
 Two or three tramp 
 With 'em in the mill, same Bentley 
 Niggas said they do it like us, you shittin' me? 
 '96, '97 in Atlanta, didn't we, have more blocks than Mutombo, Dikembe? (Bankhead!) 
 For those who can't hold water, need new kidneys 
 Put 'em down under Australia, Sydney (bye) 
 And I'm still representing 
 For the niggas on the prison yard, tuned in, listening 
 I'm back to doin' big things (okay) 
 A sucker lookin' for me, start in your bitch's dreams (that's right) 
 Or twenty feet tall standin' on the big screen 
 Get dough, big green, my flow sickening, it's the king nigga 
 (Chorus - B.o.B) 
 Put me on anything, still I bet I bust 
 Put me anywhere on the map, I bet I bust 
 This is what I does so, please don't gas me up 
 Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud 
 I bet I bust 
 I bet I bust (I, I) 
 I bet I bust 
 I bet I, I bet I, (bust) 
 I bet I bust 
 I bet I bust (I, I) 
 Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud I bet I bust 
 (Playboy Tre) 
 Yeah, back with a cup of that liquor, nigga, y'all don't really know Tre 
 Really know me, really know the streets, no, y'all niggas really ain't G 
 Really ain't hard, never really served no hard, y'all be playin' that roll 
 Talkin' that pimp shit, never really pimp shit, nah, y'all be savin' them hoes 
 But I don't and I won't, I'll get a bitch anytime I want 
 I'm that guy, spit that fire, shake the ground every time I stomp 
 Beat in the trunk, cup in the air, you can talk shit but I really don't care 
 Man I'm in the Cadillac, gon' go rat-a-tat-tat-tat but a nigga ain't scared 
 From that Red, Clay, east of the A, young niggas get locked up every day 
 Cops ain't shit, so I drop that shit, have it drop on 'em, make it through the da-ay 
 Grindin' for my pa-ay, it's that nigga Tre-e 
 Bustin' like a pistol better believe it when I say - that I bust 
 (Chorus - B.o.B) 
 Put me on anything, still I bet I bust 
 Put me anywhere on the map, I bet I bust 
 This is what I does so, please don't gas me up 
 Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud 
 I bet I bust 
 I bet I bust (I, I) 
 I bet I bust 
 I bet I, I bet I, (bust) 
 I bet I bust 
 I bet I bust (I, I) 
 Matter of fact, gimme 15 minutes and a bag of bud I bet I bust
