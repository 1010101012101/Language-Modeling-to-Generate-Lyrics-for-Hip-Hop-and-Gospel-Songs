Hold me when I'm down 
 Bury my soul underneath the ground 
 Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating 
 Shining like a chandelier 
 What's a song if it don't have words? 
 What's the word if it don't get heard 
 You can paint it anyway that you like 
 How can you get the picture if it come out blurred 
 What life taught me can't be unlearned 
 Another bridge can't be unburned 
 Can't wait till you get your firm 
 I could try to make it home but you're still on third, look 
 Your whole life need a renovation 
 Yeah, let me give you a demonstration 
 No limitations, no intimidations 
 I'm tryna live good, that's an understatement 
 They say life's about choices 
 In the face of defeat I declined 
 Put your soul into everything, never back down 
 That's how you leave a magazine behind 
 Hold me when I'm down 
 Bury my soul underneath the ground 
 Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating 
 Shining like a chandelier 
 Hold me when I'm down 
 Bury my soul underneath the ground 
 Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating 
 Shining like a chandelier 
 The world don't stop so we don't quit 
 The show goes on, tomorrow's here today 
 So live your life and do your thing 
 Enjoy each moment, it could slip away 
 Cause nothing is promised, nothing is free 
 The rain of receipts are guarantees 
 When it's done there will be no sentence fee 
 Just a far away dream you've yet to reach 
 That's why you have to go all out for it 
 No half-time, gotta ball out for it 
 That ghoul court press, life is the test 
 Can't play sick, can't call out for it 
 'Cause I don't wanna fall, no skydive 
 Stand tall through it all, that's a high rise 
 Make a something out of absolutely nothing 
 That's the definition of a survivor 
 Hold me when I'm down 
 Bury my soul underneath the ground 
 Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating 
 Shining like a chandelier 
 Hold me when I'm down 
 Bury my soul underneath the ground 
 Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating 
 Shining like a chandelier 
 So let me be like the trees 
 Where I can rest on my knees 
 To join the wind in the sky 
 If this was all a mistake, I'd rather leave this place 
 Than be your greedy life 
 Hold me when I'm down 
 Bury my soul underneath the ground 
 Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating 
 Shining like a chandelier 
 Just keep me shining like a chandelier 
 Just keep me shining like a chandelier 
 Hold me when I'm down 
 Bury my soul underneath the ground 
 Let my blood keep pumping, my heart keep beating 
 Shining like a chandelier
