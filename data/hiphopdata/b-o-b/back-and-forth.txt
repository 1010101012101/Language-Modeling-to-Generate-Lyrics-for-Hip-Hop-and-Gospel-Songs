(x4:) 
 That's right we back and forth all night 
 You know we back and forth all night 
 Ooh what you doing now 
 I love how you move it there 
 Looking mighty good yeah 
 Nothing to it but to do it yeah 
 Looking just right 
 Keep doing all the things I like 
 So girl let your hair down 
 On the floor with your hands in the air now 
 And we don't care, we don't care at all 
 No we don't care, we don't care at all 
 We knew this was something all along 
 We don't care, we don't care at all 
 (x4:) 
 That's right we back and forth all night 
 You know we back and forth all night 
 Promise you will never leave 
 A better man you will never see 
 I love what you're telling me 
 In the morning right here is where you better be 
 Don't let go 
 Buckle up, green light, let's go 
 So girl let your hair down 
 On the floor with your hands in the air now 
 And we don't care, we don't care at all 
 No we don't care, we don't care at all 
 We knew this was something all along 
 We don't care, we don't care at all 
 (x4:) 
 That's right we back and forth all night 
 You know we back and forth all night 
 We gonna dip, then glide, go 'head, back it up 
 Then we 'gon left, then right, one step to the front 
 Now do the electric slide, don't spill what's in your cup 
 And if you feel all right, then go put your hands up 
 And we don't care, we don't care at all 
 No we don't care, we don't care at all 
 We knew this was something all along 
 We don't care, we don't care at all 
 (x4:) 
 That's right we back and forth all night 
 You know we back and forth all night
