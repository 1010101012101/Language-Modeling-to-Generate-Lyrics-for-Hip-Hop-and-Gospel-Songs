(Hook: Trey Songz) 
 Everything I ever said 
 Everything that I have done 
 Tryna show 'em it's my time 
 Building actions in my mind 
 Now that's all so yesterday 
 I'm just lighting up my fire 
 Tell the world I'm saying goodbye 
 You ask me why... 
 I'm building castles in the sky 
 I'm building castles in the sky 
 (Verse 1: B.o.B) 
 I use to ride around town in a watchu call it 
 Looking like a dimmer rapper 
 Feeling like a dusty wallet 
 Getting fired, then hired, then refired 
 The idiots guide to how to build an empire 
 I show you how to stunt show you how to pop 
 Gotta watch from my wrist and a watch for my paps 
 Ballin' from the baseline, bottom to the top 
 Got bullets on speed-dial yeah I call shots 
 Now you can't act like you never heard of me 
 'Cause I'm so third degree, everyday I'm burning leaves 
 I'm in my castle and I'm never coming down 
 They always said I had my head in the clouds, HA!

 Now that's all so yesterday 
 I'm just lighting up my fire 
 Tell the world I'm saying goodbye 
 Why... 
 I'm building castles in the sky

 (Verse 2: B.o.B) 
 I use to fantasise about the badess girl I couldn't get with 
 Couldn't get her number couldn't even get her digit 
 Then I saw the light now my nights are explicit 
 I'll be lost inside the ganja with a swollen message 
 Got bills paid, got the whole hood saying damn Bobby Ray 
 Came a mighty long way 
 No GPS on starring revelation 
 I'm a self made nigger, shout out to my operation 
 It started in my mind then it started shake 
 I still can't believe these events are taking place 
 Uh, I'm in my castle and I'm never coming down 
 It's no wonder my heads in the clouds, ha!

 (Bridge: B.o.B) 
 Building castles the size of collesiums 
 Thirty thousand feet up, I swear you gotta see 'em 
 Cruising altitude with a foolish attitude 
 Headed for the moon maybe Mars, maybe Venus
