Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 I ain't been this fucked up in a while 
 Don't know how I made it to the house 
 Woke up with two bitches in my house 
 Talkin' bout they wanna have my child 
 Shawty, then the next thing (Finesse, finesse) 
 She try to finesse me (Finesse, finesse) 
 Say, say, say she like it rough, she like it wild 
 I say who am I, to let her down 
 Now she running in and out of shows 
 And the same time, running out of towels 
 Yes, she can hold a couple thous 
 If I give it to her, she gon' run her mouth 
 She try to finesse me, finesse me (Finesse, finesse, finesse, finesse) 
 If I had a someone, would you lie for me? 
 If I had a hundred, would you ride for me? 
 If I ain't make it home, would you cry for me? 
 Motherfucking liar 
 She try to finesse me, finesse me (Finesse, finesse) 
 Say she like it rough, she like it wild 
 I say you a model, let it down 
 The fountain of youth I think I done found it 
 How you say your name? I can't pronounce it 
 Flying a bitch, you can go out with 
 You probably gon' ask me to buy a mouthpiece 
 She know the promoters and all the bouncers 
 Too much on my mind, like an accountant 
 She said I'm 'bout to make an announcement 
 Bye-bye, I think I deserve an allowance 
 And then the next thing 
 I woke up in the west wing 
 Say, say, say she like it rough, she like it wild 
 Ghetto bitch, I think she wet the towels 
 Now she running in and out of shows 
 At the same time, fucking up the couch 
 She wanting me to hit it for a hour 
 If I give it to her, she gon' run her mouth 
 She try to finesse me, finesse me (Finesse, finesse, finesse, finesse) 
 If I had a someone, would you lie for me? 
 If I had a hundred, would you ride for me? 
 If I ain't make it home, would you cry for me?
