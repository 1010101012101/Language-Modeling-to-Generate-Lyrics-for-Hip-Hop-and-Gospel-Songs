B.o.B: 
 Well I got up today 
 And I put on my shades 
 And I said I was fine (I'm fine) 
 But everyone knew that I was lying 
 If you look at my face 
 And the way that I behave 
 You will still see a disguise 
 Even if you was blind (damn) 
 But now I'm saying bye, goodbye 
 American Dreaming 
 American dreaming 
 It's not that hard to find 
 Cause most of the time 
 I'm American sleeping 
 I barely can see it 
 But now I'm saying bye, goodbye 
 As I rhyme and I rap 
 The average listener is blind to the fact 
 That my mind has been tapped 
 I carry the World as it lies on my back 
 My spine coulda cracked so 
 Please pay me no mind as I laugh 
 This is all a stage every line is an act 
 Killing the American dream with a trap 
 Like a axe, I'm a put it in a sack 
 I'm a put it in the back of the black Cadillac 
 'Cause I'm traveling 
 Some say that I'm throw like a javelin 
 I'm really tryna expose to the galaxy 
 Then break off the mold to normalities 
 People called the election a tragedy 
 Looking at the screen like this can't be happening 
 I ain't saying that I'm some kind of activist 
 But something be attacking us 
 Okay, bring it back 
 I was filling my time just posing 
 Like a mannequin you pass by 
 Tryna make it one day to the big league 
 Where the girls ain't hard to find 
 All the time I was just searching 
 A plastic promised land 
 And I got myself entangled in a corporated plan (sign here) 
 But a dream is nothing 
 And it's everything at the same time 
 So you never know when you might wake up 
 And find you was just living a lies 
 Goodbye, just like Trey said 
 Goodbye America, Goodbye 
 Cause anything but the truth is a waste of time
