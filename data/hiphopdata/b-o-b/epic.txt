(B.o.B) 
 You know who it is without a doubt of hesitation 
 If money talks I got my masters in communication 
 But you can't hold a conversation 
 Probably find me burning something good you can call that smoking aces 
 Compliment the chef in the lab making greatness 
 Ain't a thing changed but the number on the statement 
 NBA resume, ballers my occupation 
 Kush so loud I can't hear what was you saying 
 Praise yo solo that the freaks in the backseat 
 Get a thrill off the alpine when it vibrate they ass cheeks 
 I'm Bobby Ray baby an all American athlete 
 I run and leap and jump and like a track meet 
 Yeah that ought to do it 
 Give it that Carl Lewis 
 I got the magic baby call me George Lucas 
 I'm so prolific but my flows so foolish 
 These niggas making moves my niggas making movies wait 
 (Playboy Tre) 
 Wile like a crazy mic 
 Clean like a baby wipe 
 Y'all just a momma boy sleeping with a baby like 
 My ex say I'm a dick cause my mind frank cocky 
 Up in Beninhan, drunk, drinking all the sake 
 Damn right I want a double fried rice 
 I'm getting bread I put my dick up in your face 
 Your facell look like Stuarts head 
 Girls call me Tre day 
 I'm looking for pay day 
 My squads got more bottle poppin' niggas than the AA 
 Liquor and wheelbarrow foolish as Will Ferrell 
 But I ain't got a step brother, I f-ck your step mother 
 I cussed 'cause I like it bitch 
 F-ck hoe mutherf-cker 
 You mad 'cause I'm balling, life is a mutherfcker 
 Your son is a leprichaun so hater live life a little 
 New shit dropping soon Patron and Instrumental 
 Its tre, my flow wont quit till I say it ends 
 (B.o.B) 
 Eastside on my arm, 3 stripes on my sneakers 
 Don't roll with p-ssy niggas, we call them vajeenas 
 That's why your girl choosing dawg, pray I never meet her 
 I tap her on the head and tell her you know the procedure 
 You just mad with no bitch 'cause I'm chilling with your bitch 
 She through out your mixtape but she knows my whole disc 
 My flows sick, I'm a poet, Edgar Allan Poe shit 
 Haters be getting defensive like 4th down and show blitz 
 But I don't punt it, I run it for a hundred 
 Ever since I was a young un, been hungry as Paul Bunyon 
 I'm the shit so fix the plumbing 
 Ima beast and the games you 
 And if this ain't what you call hip-hop it must be bungee jumping 
 I'm smoking on hydroponic some of you call that chronic 
 Hennessey in my vomit cause the night before jumpin' 
 Lil C got that beat bumping so you can hear me coming 
 And my names Bobby Ray, Eastside of the A just incase anyone was wondering bitch 
 (Meek Mill) 
 Ooh I'm a matherf-cking beast 
 All my haters rest in peace 
 I make a hundred on the Monday and go hard the rest of week 
 Pray on niggas like a Sunday 
 See your artist that's a feast 
 I got like 30 in the chalk I let you p-ssies catch a piece 
 It was me and old melly? in the Scaglietti 
 Bout to scoop these bitches 'cause they say they past ready 
 Swagger on the finish, I think I'm Andretti 
 I push it to the limit get 'em haters gassed heavy 
 Wait a minute I'm a menace 
 Shout out to the winners 
 Jacket boy Louies like a flag before the finish? 
 I'm just getting started and niggas at they end 
 And errbody say I'm hot but I've been hot from the beginning 
 I be with a bitch that looks like Kim Kardashian 
 She ain't on these niggas not by purpose but by accident 
 Big ?, you niggas relaxing 
 And the main reason I'm passing 'em like Michael Vick I'm faster than yo quarter back 
 I bring that order back 
 Ain't f-ckig with that weed, like where that water at 
 Like where them purps nigga 
 Somebody order that 
 Caught a couple cases, went to jail but I ain't going back 
 Free tip!
