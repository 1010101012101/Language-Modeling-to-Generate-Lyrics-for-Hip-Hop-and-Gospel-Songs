(Verse One) 
 They say, "B.O.B why not put the guitar down and rap?" 
 It's easier to sing than put my soul on a track 
 Cause the media has made a competition out of rap 
 So constantly they comparin' me to 3 Stacks (Andre 3000) 
 I try to grow freely but they hold me to my past 
 Sayin' the music that I'm makin' doesn't appeal to the mass 
 Hmm 
 What am I to do about that? 
 When the syndicated radio is always playin' trash 
 Every single song is the same old track 
 About Patron, Patron, Patron and swag, swag, swag 
 Patron and swag and the whole hood is singin' 
 "Patron and swag" 
 And everybody wonder why the kids so bad 
 'Cause they only thing they know is Patron and SWAG!
