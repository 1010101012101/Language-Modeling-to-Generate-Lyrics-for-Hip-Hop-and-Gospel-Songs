Lady (Um humm) 
 Oh baby (Um humm) 
 My sweet baby (Um humm) 
 You're the one (Fury) 
 Lady (Oh yeah) 
 Oh, baby (oh yeah) 
 My sweet baby (oh yeah) 
 You're the one 
 Uh huh... I know 
 (Verse One) 
 Well it's Mr. Obituary, put beats in a cemetery 
 I rip a beat into pieces, like sheets in a dictionary 
 The teachers try tried to teach me but I was sleepin' in every class 
 I never passed, it didn't seem necessary 
 I'm super psychedelic 
 I'm smokin' weed whit the fairies 
 And if drugs are bad, throw away every CD you carry 
 Cause drugs have inspired every musical visionary 
 And this ain't even the album 
 So the thought alone should be scary 
 I do this for the geeks who feel they need to compare me 
 I swear I'll push this button, give me a reason or dare me 
 And everything gets blown and everybody gets buried 
 And there you have it, I shot the track like Berry 
 Lady (oh yeah) 
 Oh, baby (oh yeah) 
 Oh, baby (oh yeah) 
 Oh, baby (oh yeah) 
 My, my baby (oh yeah) 
 Oh, baby (oh yeah) 
 My sweet baby (oh yeah) 
 You're the one 
 I know, I know, I know, haha 
 (Verse Two) 
 They tryin' figure out, what's my business incentive 
 I'm simply tryin' speak to who or whatever will listen 
 And reach out to the kids who the doctor prescribed with Ritalin 
 So this for all of my aliens and all the Indigo Children 
 And anyone who said I would never see this position 
 Allow me to drop my pants and turn around for you to kiss it 
 Huh 
 But that was the motivation I needed for me to get it 
 And this has been a Bobby Ray Power Point presentition 
 I mean... presentation... 
 Aww, whatever you don't care
