B.o.B 
 Uno is my Numeral 
 They said hip hop was stacked 
 I must have missed the funeral 
 Well see what happen was 
 They started assuming stuff 
 'Cause I don't think the bible is goin' to get here soon enough 
 I like thick hoes that like to get the beutty rough 
 So when I am in the room with her 
 That's what I do to her 
 I send her ass to Jupiter 
 Stretch uterus 
 And when I'm through with her 
 Man I put my boot in her (ooh!) 
 Ha, see y'all can miss me with that silly shit 
 I fittin to ride for my hood 
 I ain't Benedick 
 I go extra extra hard 
 I ain't fittin to quit 
 I'm in this thing for the bread 
 I ain't in for friends 
 And yeah I spit it off the brain 
 I ain't in the pants 
 And no I can't pretend 
 My nigga I'm genuine 
 Okay so let me tell you what I'm interested in 
 Big fat ass blunts of kush and twins
