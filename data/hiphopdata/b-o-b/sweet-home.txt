(And that's how we motherfuckin' do it!) 
 Sweet home Atlanta 
 On that east side Howdy do 
 So if you from that there Atlanta 
 Then this blank goes out to you 
 Country boy walkin', 
 Country boy talkin', 
 Don't nobody visit these here parts often 
 That's when we be sparkin, cigarillos often, 
 Take a hit and now the whip is smellin' like a forest. 
 I remember when I was stayin in apartments. 
 Bad ass kid jumpin' off the barn bitch. 
 Dirty hair full of lint from the carpet. 
 Couldn't stay in one spot, I was car sick. 
 (Sweet Home!) 
 When I was growin' up we didn't have no heat on in the home. 
 So in the winter we just lit heaters for the cold. 
 And in the kitchen wasn't nothin' to eat but cereal. 
 Sweet home Atlanta 
 On that east side Howdy do 
 So if you from that there Atlanta 
 Then this blank goes out to you
