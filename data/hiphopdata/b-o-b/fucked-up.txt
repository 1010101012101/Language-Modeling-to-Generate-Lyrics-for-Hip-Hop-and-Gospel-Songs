(Feat Playboy Tre) 
 I've lost control 
 And I've lost my soul 
 I stand so cold 
 'Cause I've lost control! 
 Is that's why you think I'm cool, 
 Because I get fucked up, fucked up? 
 Is that's why you think I'm cool, 
 Because I get fucked up, fucked up? 
 Is that why? 
 Is that why? 
 Is that's why you think I'm cool, 
 Because I get fucked up, fucked up? 
 Way too fucked up obviously 
 But that's what just happens when the bottles are free 
 Prestige like an older man 
 I'm laid up in the sweet like Solomon 
 You all just following. 
 I'm half way across the world, it just occurred to me 
 I look down, wallet full of currency 
 Table full of shots, that's courtesy 
 Brought niggers fake bowling, that's perjure. 
 I do my thing certainly 
 One black, one Asian, the adversity 
 I got a girl, she got a girl, we doing both concomitantly 
 I wanna see 'em lips move, and I ain't talking verbally! 
 I'm at the peak, man 
 I'm Hon, Kong high! You wanna see me falling, I don't know why 
 I'm getting... at the Hon Kong spot 
 And the world keeps spinning, but I don't know why. 
 Is that's why you think I'm cool, 
 Because I get fucked up, fucked up? 
 Is that's why you think I'm cool, 
 Because I get fucked up, fucked up? 
 Is that's why you think I'm cool, 
 Because I get fucked up, fucked up? 
 Is that's why you think I'm cool, 
 Because I get fucked up, fucked up? 
 First class down my ass, don't know how to act 
 Tell a broad with a big... bring a ... 
 I need a lot of that, hustle with, party hard 
 I can't see you fuck boys... 
 Hon-Kong, nice girls, international speaking 
 ...International drinking 
 Living life, stop soaring, make a ... 
 Hit a freak on one... call it captain Morgan 
 You all are hater, while we all lean 
 Getting hurt with the true fucking... 
 Make it take controls off, I need... 
 And don't be stringent with that stuff, 'cause we all friends! 
 Tell me som freaking, 
 I kiss my home girl, were out of here... in my own world! 
 Call it... over no fat Jesus 
 Your truly, Mr. Pat Belly, good evening! 
 Is that's why you think I'm cool, 
 Because I get fucked up, fucked up? 
 Is that's why you think I'm cool, 
 Because I get fucked up, fucked up? 
 Is that's why you think I'm cool, 
 Because I get fucked up, fucked up? 
 Is that's why you think I'm cool, 
 Because I get fucked up, fucked up?
