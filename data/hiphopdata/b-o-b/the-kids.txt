Drug boy steady shootin' 
 The streets don't give a damn 
 They're filled with such pollution 
 The kids don't stand a chance 
 We're trapped inside the matrix 
 Forced to play our hand 
 We're filled with so much hatred 
 The kids don't stand a chance, 
 I said the kids don't, the kids don't stand, the kids don't stand a chance 
 I said the kids don't, the kids don't stand, the kids don't stand a chance 
 B.o.B: 
 Well, 
 Since I was planted at birth, 
 I abandoned my own planet 
 And I landed on Earth, 
 As a kid I never understood what I observed, and 
 Some of it was strange but most of it disturbed me 
 Always in detention for the lack of my attention 
 You can call it deficit 
 Really I just didn't listen 
 And I was always missing 
 The teachers like, "Where is Bobby Simmons?" 
 But tryna get a record deal is all I can remember 
 It's funny 'cause looking back on the path that I had 
 On my days in the streets tryna prove that I was bad 
 I still elevated to the level that I'm at 
 (Still elevated to the level that I'm at) 
 Drive by steady shootin' 
 The streets don't give a damn 
 They're filled with such pollution 
 The kids don't stand a chance 
 We're trapped inside the matrix 
 Forced to play our hand 
 We're filled with so much hatred 
 The kids don't stand a chance, 
 I said the kids don't, the kids don't stand, the kids don't stand a chance 
 I said the kids don't, the kids don't stand, the kids don't stand a chance 
 Janelle Mon√°e: 
 Sometimes it's hard to grow 
 While living in fear of the unknown 
 How can he ever give love 
 When no love is in his heart? 
 A child can barely sleep at night, too worried about tomorrow 
 And what if he holds-- he drowns himself 
 Deep down in his sorrows 
 Will you run and will you share your light 
 Tell a story, live and try 
 See its when we're giving hope 
 That we know that we can grow.
