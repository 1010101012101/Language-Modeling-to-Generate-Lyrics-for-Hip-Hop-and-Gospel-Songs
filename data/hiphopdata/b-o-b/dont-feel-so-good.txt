Oh whoa 
 They say life's for livin' 
 Well I don't feel so good today 
 I guess I'll drift away 
 I just get this feelin' 
 Because this system is a cage 
 Like the prison gates 
 Dnd if you don't feel it 
 Then how come Independence Day 
 Is just a holiday 
 I get the feeling that this boat (I feel this boat) 
 Is a type of sink, cause it can't float (it can not float) 
 And I get the feeling that we're close (I feel we're close) 
 To the end of the thing that we all know (that we all know) 
 (Verse Two) 
 Well excuse my expression 
 But I don't give a fuck today 
 So there's not much to say 
 Hey 
 Well I went to my bed 
 But crazy thoughts kept running through my head 
 I need some Sudafed 
 Well if you were my mirror 
 Then you would see a very sad look on my face 
 The life of Bobby Ray 
 Hey 
 I get the feeling that this boat (I feel this boat) 
 Is a type of sink, cause it can't float (it can not float) 
 And I get the feeling that we're close (I feel we're close) 
 To the end of the thing that we all know (that we all know) 
 (Verse Three) 
 Well if I gave you a few words to show my most genuine emotion 
 They would not describe the way I feel inside 
 Actually you would have to experience an explosion 
 So I, just learn to control 'em 
 Keep my spirit high to keep my gundilini flowin' 
 Through the the 7-point chakra system 
 From my toes to the top of my head 
 And in between my shoulders 
 If ya don't know than you probably can't focus 
 On nothin' but it's easy, so your mind ain't yours 
 You're getting lied to and you don't even know it! (Damn) 
 The youths so blind but they eyes wide open 
 I get the feeling that this boat (I feel this boat) 
 Is a type of sink, cause it can't float (it can not float) 
 And I get the feeling that we're close (I feel we're close) 
 To the end of the thing that we all know (that we all know)
