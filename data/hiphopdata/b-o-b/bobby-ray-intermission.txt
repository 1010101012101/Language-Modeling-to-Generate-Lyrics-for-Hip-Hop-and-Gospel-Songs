My name is Bobby Ray 
 And this my side of the mixtape 
 The songs that you are about to hear 
 Naw I'm just jokin, heh heh 
 My name is Bobby Ray 
 I am the guy, that plays, B.o.B 
 I am the guy, that you see on the TV screen 
 That... B.o.B is like my alter ego 
 And you know this side, this, this mixtape 
 Is to truly, get you to understand 
 Who I really am, and the music, that I really make 
 The sound that I have been crafting for years 
 From doin' open mics, to doin' arenas 
 To goin' right back, to venues, gettin' stared at 
 You know, just everything 
 Everything that I've been workin on, I've put it, into songs 
 And now I will share them with you for free 
 I'm doin' this STRICTLY, to give you music 
 That's the only reason I do it 
 So without further adieu, I introduce to you 
 Bobby Ray
