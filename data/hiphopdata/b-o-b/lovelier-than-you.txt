Maybe one day we can go 
 Hand in hand down a golden road 
 And if I get there before you go 
 I'll be waitin' at the door, 
 In the future hopefully 
 We'll be together you and me 
 Don't you worry baby please 
 'Cause honestly: 
 If I could rewind 
 Both the hands of time 
 Still I would never find 
 A lovelier design 
 Than you, nothings lovelier than you 
 Nothing's lovelier than you, 
 Nothing's lovelier than you. 
 Maybe one day girl I pray 
 We can float off to space 
 Hold my hand I'll lead the way 
 And I won't let go and fall astray 
 Ain't no if, but and maybe's 
 You're my baby, my lady 
 Don't you worry baby please 
 'Cause honestly 
 If I could rewind 
 Both the hands of time 
 Still I would never find 
 A lovelier design 
 Than you, nothing lovelier than you 
 I'm dangerously, dangerously, dangerously in love 
 I love her more than myself and still that ain't enough 
 If this a dream then I don't wanna wake up, 
 We go together like the tub and the showerhead above, 
 Ha, not even thousands and thousands of miles could amount to my love 
 I'd have countless sky miles 
 I'd climb up a mountain, climb right back down I'd, 
 Run across the world and jump back around, 
 A noun and a verb is just a sound, and a word is not profound 
 Enough to show my urge for her smile 
 I'd shout on the curb with a loudspeaker 
 Till the whole town heard how I felt, an amount 
 Nothing's lovelier than you, nothing's lovelier than you, 
 Nothing's lovelier than you, nothing's lovelier than you. 
 Maybe one day we can go 
 Hand in hand down a golden road 
 And if I get there before you go 
 I'll be waitin' at the door, 
 In the future hopefully 
 We'll be together you and me 
 Don't you worry baby please 
 'Cause honestly: 
 If I could rewind 
 Both the hands of time 
 Still I would never find 
 A lovelier design, than you.
