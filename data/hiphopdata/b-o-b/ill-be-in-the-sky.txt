 Yeah 
 I'll be in the sky 
 Remember when I leave, 
 That the one in the mirror ain't me 
 It's just someone that I call B.O.B 
 Its kinda me but it's not 
 Its just a mask that I got 
 So that I can rap and get off my block 
 Reminiscin my past when I was a toddler 
 Sittin' in grass and playin' with blocks 
 Failing my classes now I'm on lockdown 
 Now writin and readin a lot 
 Money and weed is in my shoe box now 
 While I'm tryina get me a glock 
 'Cause I thought I was at the end of my line 
 Then I find out it was all in my mind 
 That's why I'm here to end all the fear 
 We all gon die and leave from here like 
 I was a man with no name 
 Now I'm attributing mo fame 
 But all of this ain't gonna matter when I a die 
 And say good bye so long 
 Sayonara I'll have to catch you tomorra baby, cause, baby 
 I, ll be in the sky 
 I, ll be there 
 Ooh all right 
 I, ll be in the sky 
 I, ll be there 
 Ooh all right 
 I'll be in the sky 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah 
 I'll be in the sky 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah 
 I'll be in the sky 
 Everyone here gonna die one day 
 So while I'm here, I'ma find my way 
 That's my forte, that's why I'm here 
 Shit to open up your ears and speak this real 
 Beatin' down the block with a shoot ya 
 The gold teeth don't really match with the suit 
 Nowadays folk would rather rap than go to school 
 'Cause they feel that if they black then they gotta have a tool 
 But y'all don't really seen that there 
 After all everybody wanna kick back 
 They wanna sit back, they wanna sip Goose, 
 They wanna get down, they wanna get loose, 
 They wanna get blown, they wanna see the truth, 
 They wanna get old just like you, 
 But since they ain't nobody gon be responsible, 
 I'ma gonna have to be the one to show, 
 I was a man with no name 
 Now I'm attributing mo fame 
 But all of this ain't gonna matter when I a die 
 And say good bye so long 
 Sayonara I'll have to catch you tomorra baby, cause, baby 
 I, ll be in the sky 
 I, ll be there 
 Ooh all right 
 I, ll be in the sky 
 I, ll be there 
 Ooh all right 
 I'll be in the sky 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah 
 I'll be in the sky 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah yeah yeah 
 Yeah 
 I'll be in the sky 
 I, ll be there 
 Ooh all right 
 I, ll be there 
 I, ll be there 
 Ooh all right 
 I, ll be there 
 I, ll be there 
 Ooh all right 
 I, ll be there 
 I, ll be there 
 Ooh all right 
 I, ll be there
