I'm just doin' my thang man but they can't do it quite like me 'cause they not like me 
 I put my shoes on like ya my shirt on like ya my jeans on like ya but I ain't nothing like ya I put my shades on like ya set my rims high like ya keep a bad bitch like ya but I ain't nothing like ya now You can't be fly like me you can't be fly like me you can't be fly like cause you just ain't B.O.B 
 I pull up to the parkin lot 
 Tinted windows on the car ain't stock 
 And you already know how I do when I do it when I hop up out the car they stop 
 Straight pimpin' in my LRG 
 Creative rec on my feet 
 So everybody lookin' at my toes as I creep quit lookin' cause you ain't got these 
 I talk it how I want to talk it 
 Y'all better know what the business was 
 Soon as I hit the club everybody grabbing on me cause 
 They wish they was I wish I could 
 Go back when back when I didn't get to much 
 To show y'all haters how I came up 
 When y'all ain't pull enough 
 So I get fresh to deffer than you you 
 Can't be me don't think you could 
 Yeah East side that's right on deck 
 Straight up slangin that wood 
 Handle that good man you can have that back 
 Grippin wood grain like caddilac I see your charger bet mines harder whippin that black on black 
 I put my shoes on like ya my shirt on like ya my jeans on like ya but I ain't nothing like ya I put my shades on like ya set my rims high like ya keep a bad bitch like ya but I ain't nothing like ya now You can't be fly like me you can't be fly like me you can't be fly like cause you just ain't B.O.B 
 Well I ain't nothing like y'all 
 Stay fresh from winter to fall 
 And you already know how I move when I move when I come through the door they pause 
 Lookin' fresh in my ?mascete? 
 With them academic jeans 
 With them oalkeys on my face I can see you but you can't see me 
 I walk it how I want to walk it 
 Y'all already know imma let them hang 
 As soon as I hit the stage man I get things shakin like an 8.8 
 And to this day I don't play 
 I came from the struggle so obide my pay 
 I want them marble counter tops forget them paper plates 
 Cause you not me and I'm not like you 
 A whole bunch of real players in my crew 
 But now adays everybody so fake 
 That you can only trust a few 
 Think I'm talkin' about you well 
 Then I prolly am if the shoe fits put it on your foot 
 Yeah east side half squad on deck straight up slangin that wood
