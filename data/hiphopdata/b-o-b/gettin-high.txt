The days that I that I seem to be gettin' by, 
 Are the days that I'm gettin' High (thoes the only days that I'm feelin' fine) 
 The days that I that I seem to be gettin' by, 
 Are the days that I'm gettin' High (so that's why every day I'm high) 
 I roll up, 
 Somethin' to smoke up, 
 The day ain't really goin' so well, 
 But as soon as I smell the fresh aramoa of the coffee my mind eaze 
 It helps me focus on what really I'm tryin' to see, 
 And how I wana feel, 
 With just chill, and relaxed and it eased, 
 And I can be all three with the weed, 
 It uplifts me, 
 Just a spliff see, 
 What have me feelin' much better than if I was tipsy 
 Times can get ruffer than rugby 
 A couple of hits of this can turn ugly to lovely, 
 In the morning it's my medicine, 
 Its also my nightcap 
 It helps me sing, it helps me write raps, 
 I might tap into a part of my brain that I hardly use, 
 Because of the liquor and boose, 
 If I had to choose, 
 It would be the weed fo-sho,(hey) 
 My bag is gettin' low, 
 Yo I need some more.

 Well everyday is a mystery, 
 At least to me life ain't what you think its finna be, 
 So I blow my misery away with stems and seeds, 
 Like a chimany, 
 Yup my remedy, 
 So I keep it extra cooley 
 Yes its 10 degrees 
 And I tend to sing like a symphony, 
 Why do I instantly, find my identity 
 When I climb into my memory's 
 One 
 What else is there to say 
 I know you feel me especially when you wake up every day 
 And you look in the mirror, but you see a different face 
 Even though you swear you never ever ever changed her 
 So without further a due 
 These words I hold in matrimony straight from me to you, 
 So here's my vision, 
 Get you somethin' sticky, 
 Put it in a swisher 
 And elevate into the blue 
 The days that I that I seem to be gettin' by, 
 Are the days that I'm gettin' High (thoes the only days that I'm feelin' fine) 
 The days that I that I seem to be gettin' by, 
 Are the days that I'm gettin' High (so that's why every day I'm high)
