Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost 
 They gave me nothing but doubt 
 First they waited then hated then counted me out 
 Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm stuck 
 They say I lost my way 
 But first I showed 'em then I sold em 
 Right in front of their face 
 B.o.B 
 Well this is the world that we living 
 One minute you the hero the next you the villain 
 We got up in this game just to try to make a living 
 We hit you with the truth while you watching television 
 But still these are the cards that we dealt 
 They kick you on the ground when you most need help 
 Until you dried up and they sit you on the shelf 
 Then you start to cry because you all by yourself 
 So just know if you are aware of the belt 
 The only way to excel is the soul that you sell 
 So I could care less about the clothes on myself 
 I'm trying to drive straight on a road made of nails 
 Yeah, I got to pay the toll if I fell 
 Or else it would be another story to tell 
 I'm getting to the door I can tell 
 I'm just waiting on the day till the glory prevails 
 Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost 
 They gave me nothing but doubt 
 First they waited then hated then counted me out 
 Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm stuck 
 They say I lost my way 
 But first I showed 'em then I sold em 
 Right in front of their face 
 T.I. 
 All I know is keep going, shit don't stop 
 Until the huss double up put the click on top 
 Used to wanna have the bricks on lock 
 Till we went to prison saw we couldn't pick them locks 
 Easy decision now a n-gga think I lost my touch 
 Listen if I ain't the realest ever done it I ain't off by much 
 So please don't wake me up if I'm dreaming in the fast lane speedin' no safety belt 
 And it's a marathon pace yourself 
 In this race for wealth talkin' shit just a waste of breath 
 Chasing me like chasing your tail your never gon catch it 
 Tespect is something you never get if you never had it 
 I'm looking back and laughing this life of mine 
 Bought me all the way here form my life of crime 
 Just a constant reminder that the end I'll be always the one who knows all see's all 
 Because... 
 Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost 
 They gave me nothing but doubt 
 First they waited then hated then counted me out 
 Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm stuck 
 They say I lost my way 
 But first I showed 'em then I sold em 
 Right in front of their face 
 B.o.B 
 Yeah, well these are my predictions 
 I'll be on the top 40 with a big hit 
 Travelling the world trying not to get sick 
 And I'ma get more friends on my friends list 
 And then after that I'll be famous 
 And everyone I know will tell me that I'm changing 
 And then my cell phone will never stop ringing 
 And I'll be all over magazine pages 
 Yeah and they'll play my songs till they boring 
 And if I ever do stop touring they treat me like a foreigner 
 Don't believe me, ask Lauren... 
 Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost 
 They gave me nothing but doubt 
 First they waited then hated then counted me out 
 Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm stuck 
 They say I lost my way 
 But first I showed 'em then I sold em 
 Right in front of their face
