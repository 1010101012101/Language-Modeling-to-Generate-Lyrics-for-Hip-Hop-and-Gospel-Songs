(Chorus: B.o.B) 
 My soul is getting weary, weary 
 And I know the ending is nearing, nearing tonight 
 So just say goodbye and kiss your dreams goodnight 
 So just say goodbye and kiss your dreams goodnight 
 (Verse 1: B.o.B.) 
 So just say goodnight to your dreams 
 Because tonight is the night of the beast 
 I am not frightened, I'm delighted to speak 
 When the time comes, until the night we will lead 
 That's why I decided to B. O. to the B 
 So, one time for the streets 
 One time for all the minds hypnotized by TV 
 Because everything is just a spiral to me 
 (Break) 
 Goodbye, say goodbye 
 Say goodbye 
 (Verse 2: B.o.B) 
 So get your hands up high 
 No, don't be shy, raise 'em up to the sky 
 Because we will survive 
 Yeah, storm after storm, there's still sunshine 
 So can you feel the vibe? 
 Yeah, just like yeast, I'm a major rise 
 So just say goodbye 
 And just kiss it goodnight when the day arrives 
 (Break) 
 (Break - repeat 2X) 
 (Break) 
 (B.o.B.) So just say goodbye and kiss your dreams goodnight
