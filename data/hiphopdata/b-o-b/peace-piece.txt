(B.o.B.:) 
 I tried to take the high road 
 Let by gones be by gones 
 I tried to take the high road 
 But now another life's gone 
 What you expect from me? 
 To turn the other cheek 
 All you bring is war, asking me for peace 
 What you expect from me, when all you bring is greed 
 All you bring is war, asking me for peace 
 But now I gotta piece piece piece 
 But now I gotta piece piece piece 
 But now I gotta piece piece piece 
 But now I gotta piece piece piece 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Yeah, they say let's make America great again 
 Except for the slavery and the genocide 
 When we kill all the native and steal their tribes 
 And it's time we denied women's rights 
 Talkin' 'bout great, like the AIDS outbreak 
 Like when they brought crack cocaine to the hood 
 Like when they brought heroin to the states 
 Justice is not on the internet 
 Equality don't have a twitter account 
 The last words that a man should ever hear 
 Should never be "Get on the ground" 
 Our culture so misunderstood, it's cloudy up over the hood 
 I think about packing my bags and leaving this country for good 
 Glock, Glock in my car for your probable 'cause 
 'Cause even the law don't follow the law 
 Guess it's my fault for being black 
 A country built on my people's backs 
 Up in first class, yeah my seat is black 
 Even when I'm bored and I'm tryna see my past 
 Tell me, if you had a chance, would you go back in time to see the past? 
 Waitin', waitin', waitin' for reparation 
 For the end of segregation 
 All we got is a month and a television station 
 All they teach is slavery and we celebrate it 
 They turn the cheek if we should perish 
 But just remember you can't spell America without Eric 
 I tried to take the high road 
 Let by gones be by gones 
 I tried to take the high road 
 But now another life's gone 
 What you expect from me? 
 To turn the other cheek 
 All you bring is war, asking me for peace 
 What you expect from me, when all you bring is greed 
 All you bring is war, asking me for peace 
 But now I gotta piece piece piece 
 But now I gotta piece piece piece 
 But now I gotta piece piece piece 
 But now I gotta piece piece piece 
 Yeah, yeah 
 (Big Krit:) 
 By any means necessary 
 Lately two many mommas out here bearing babies 
 Really ain't safe 'round here no more 
 Scared of the law when they head outdoors 
 And will we ever be at peace, man? I ain't sure 
 But for now I'm like Malcolm out the window it's simple altercation 
 Got these motherfuckers blazin' and I ain't tryna say bye to my kinfolk 
 They choke us out like what they need a noose for? 
 Gentrify like fuck wherever you go 
 Prison walls nowadays big biz 
 Give us dope then lock us up to get riches 
 Then send us out to a job we can't get 
 You had that nigga flipped now you back in the system 
 That's a cold game man, aww dog if there's a God pray she listening 
 The president don't give a fuck about us 
 The government don't give a fuck either 
 They talkin' make America great again 
 I just wanna say my piece 
 I just want that 40 acres and mule 
 Another promise didn't fall through 
 Just a whole lot of propaganda and lying to me and you 
 I tried to take the high road 
 (B.o.B.:) 
 I tried to take the high road 
 Let by gones be by gones 
 I tried to take the high road 
 But now another life's gone 
 What you expect from me? 
 To turn the other cheek 
 All you bring is war, asking me for peace 
 What you expect from me, when all you bring is greed 
 All you bring is war, asking me for peace 
 But now I gotta piece piece piece 
 But now I gotta piece piece piece 
 But now I gotta piece piece piece 
 But now I gotta piece piece piece 
 Yeah, yeah
