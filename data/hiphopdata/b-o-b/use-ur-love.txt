I met a lil shorty on a Wednesday night 
 And she was chillen in the V.I.P 
 I said hey girl wh-what's your name? 
 She just smiled and it was over 
 'Cause I just wanna use your love tonight (Yeah-Yeah-Yeah) 
 And I just wanna work you girl all night 
 My girl was on vacation 
 So I been microwaving 
 So I went out late-night chasing 
 I met a girl mixed with Asian 
 I ain't one to seem impatient 
 So I told her it was late-forget a date 
 And B.o.B wanna layin 
 And that's the truth just face it 
 So don't get mad and angry 
 You know you really anxious 
 You light a cigarette up 
 Cause you are very anxious 
 And 'cause I was a stranga 
 Now your legs in the air-a 
 Some may call b.o. playa 
 Cause the way I treat females cause... 
 (I-I just wanna use your love tonight) 
 So baby please don't leave me waitin' 
 (I-I don't wanna lose your love tonight) 
 So baby please don't leave me hangin'

 That you about to 
 Go-Go-Go 
 You know you like 
 My swag and how I

 Acting like your 
 So-So-Cold 
 'Cause I ain't finn'in to chase you down 
 'Cause I just wanna use your love tonight (Yeah-Yeah-Yeah) 
 And I just wanna work you girl all night 
 Still you know I'm so good 
 Results from no love hoe

 Thick young lady name (door?)
