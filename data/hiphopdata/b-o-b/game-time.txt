(Verse: B.o.B) 
 Hahaha 
 Hahaha 
 You feel it? 
 Well if you're trying to stop me it don't matter 
 I got the power of a 40 caliber 
 Got the flow, got the style, got the stamina 
 Better call you a police and ambulance 
 'Cause I'm rippin' 'em down tasin' 'em down 
 Slower than four legged animals 
 All I need is a blunt of that canibus 
 And I leap in the air like a catapult 
 Look way up there it's a bird it's a plane 
 No it's the savior to change the game 
 Doin' my damn thing 
 Shootin' 'em up like bam bang pow 
 Getting a little bit now 
 Lettin' 'em know to bow down 
 Yup it's b o bizzle and I'm letting 'em know what I'm about. 
 (Hook: B.o.B) 
 They got the cameras on let 'em know it's game time 
 Strap 'em up strap 'em up 'cause it's game time 
 Toe to toe 
 Blow for blow 
 Now it's game time 
 Yeah it's game time 
 Yeah it's game time 
 It's game time 
 It's game time 
 It's game time 
 Lettin' 'em know it's game time 
 It's game time 
 It's game time 
 It's game time 
 Lettin' 'em know it's game time
