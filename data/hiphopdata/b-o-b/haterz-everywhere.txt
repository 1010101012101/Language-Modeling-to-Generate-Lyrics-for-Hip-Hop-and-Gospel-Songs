We got 'em goin' down for the count 
 Lookin' down at the ground 
 That's why we got hataz 
 That's why we got hataz 
 Hataz everywhere we go 
 Hataz everywhere we go 
 Hataz everywhere we go, where we go, 
 Hataz goin' down for the count (ONE) 
 Lookin' at da grounda (TWO) 
 I think you're a hata 
 I think you're a hata 
 Hataz everywhere we go 
 Hataz everywhere we go 
 Hataz everywhere we go, where we go, 
 Hataz goin' down for the count 
 This sir, is the beef from the caterz 
 K, C's, dem men, and dem hataz (?) 
 Real sharp on my thing like a razor 
 Blade come clean like a shape up 
 So guess I got a game of tape up 
 But errybody gotta feel the need to say summin 
 But can't speak up whenever you face em 
 That's what I call microphone gangstas 
 Yeah I got 'em over do'd (?) 
 Yeah I'm raw you know my flow 
 'Cause b.o.b be actin' hard like a Viagra overdose 
 Talkin' that noise on all dem songs 
 A buncha lil boys and ya don't look grown 
 Those niggas there and these niggas here 
 But it really don't matta 'cause they all just clones 
 Gotta school, do the work, be a lawyer 
 Hell yeah I'm all for the cause 
 Don't wanna get involved with tha law sir 
 But a nigga still got the moss burgs 
 And that just fell on tha track and the song (?) 
 Don't get it wrong this track is my own 
 'Cause niggas that slip they don't last long 
 Hey what it live, breath homie 
 Me, I'm doin' what I always do 
 Grindin if you wasn't steady hatin' you'd be ballin too 
 I know you see us sprawlin through 
 All the rich niggas is on our crew 
 Fuck it, they can't touch us 
 If stuck-up's what ya call it cool 
 Ooh, You shoulda seen when I came down in that 
 Black on Black 
 Gata hataz face down on the mat 
 Splat 
 I can make a green nigga mad 
 Quick, fast, flash like tin cash on this bitch's tag 
 You can tell I'ma G from a walk in the stands 
 Don't care 'bout the game make 'em talk in the stands 
 Watch how you talk when you talk to the man 
 If it ain't about bread you can talk to da hand 
 I, I, Show you how to get rich 
 The game we on, I'll show you how to pitch 
 Made a play with a hit (?) 
 And told the police I don't know bout shit 
 Ay guy, I'm fly, summin like tha air 
 Ain't that summin, when its stunting, there's nothing like air 
 Homey hold it right there 
 Home boy hold it down 
 Spit five at the mall and had them hataz goin' dowwwnnnn
