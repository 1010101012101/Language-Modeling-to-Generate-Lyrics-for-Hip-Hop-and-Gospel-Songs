We are the have-nots who never had nothing 
 But learned to make something, out of never having nothing at all 
 And you could have it all and feel you never need nothing 
 But he who loves nothing will never have nothing at all 
 And you could be a superstar 
 But still feel like an outlaw 
 And never need nothing at all 
 But still have an empty heart 
 When me and my sister was literally playin' in dirt 
 I can still see the smile on her face, in my head I can still see the mud on my shirt 
 Fuckin' freezing my ass off at night with this match, tryna get this lil' fire to work 
 And my mom just got fired from work, and meanwhile we was gettin' evicted 
 Our living condition was not ideal but some kinda way we learned 
 That growing up poor don't make you real 
 They don't want to see us happy, they just sell us Happy-Meals 
 So we throw these records on, it's the only thing that has appeal 
 And the sadness disappears, so what's up with us 
 What to do with us, they don't know what to do 
 All they can do is call us thugs till they need they problem solve 
 Need someone to run they club 
 He who doesn't love what he has will never have enough 
 We are the have-nots who never had nothing 
 But learned to make something, out of never having nothing at all 
 And you could have it all and feel you never need nothing 
 But he who loves nothing will never have nothing at all 
 And you could be a superstar 
 But still feel like an outlaw 
 And never need nothing at all 
 But still have an empty heart
