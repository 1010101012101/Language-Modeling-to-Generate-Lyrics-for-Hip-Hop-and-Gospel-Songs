They can take these clothes off my back 
 They can take my money 
 Don't care about that 
 They can't take my words 
 It's all I've got 
 They can have this fame 
 It ain't worth a lot 
 Only thing I know, is I'll never let you go 
 As she takes the stand 
 By the look in her eyes I can tell that's she knows 
 That she's holding the faith of my world in her hands 
 Yeah, fo' real 
 This was never the plan 
 It was never intended for her to end up to defend 
 And I guess it just happened by chance 
 Yeah, and you hope 
 You hopin' that a miracle happens 
 You played at the George just to bring that down 
 Just so you can go back and avoid a disaster 
 And you could still be holding her hand 
 Like the last note of the saddest song 
 We're like the last word at the end of the poem 
 You know, sometimes wanna be here alone 
 It's funny how you never know what you got till it's gone 
 They can take these clothes off my back 
 They can take my money 
 Don't care about that (no) 
 They can't take my words (take my words) 
 It's all I've got 
 They can have this fame 
 It ain't worth a lot 
 Only thing I know, is I'll never let you go 
 Won't let you go 
 No, never gonna let you go 
 Won't let you go 
 No, never gonna let you go 
 Won't let you go 
 No, never gonna let you go 
 Won't let you go 
 No, never gonna let you go 
 What's the one thing in this life that you live for? 
 Who do you know in the world you would die for? 
 Who would lie for? 
 Who if they committed a crime you would stop on a dime and do time for 
 'Cause it was me she would lie for 
 And that was her that I cried for 
 Now I'd give it all away to get her back 
 'Cause she ain't free, no, just waiting July 4th 
 Yeah, no, it don't sound logical 
 But there's some things in this life that you gotta do 
 Brother, one thing in this world that got to you 
 I'd let it all go but I ain't dropping you 
 They can take these clothes off my back (clothes) 
 They can take my money 
 Don't care about that (that) 
 They can't take my words 
 It's all I've got (It's all I've got) 
 They can have this fame 
 It ain't worth a lot 
 Only thing I know, is I'll never let you go 
 Won't let you go 
 No, never gonna let you go 
 Won't let you go 
 No, never gonna let you go 
 Won't let you go 
 No, never gonna let you go 
 Won't let you go 
 No, never gonna let you go 
 It might be wrong or it might be right 
 But there's no looking back and we won't sleep tonight 
 We're living while we're young and this is worth the fight 
 Even if I lost it all 
 They can take these clothes off my back (clothes) 
 They can take my money 
 Don't care about that (that) 
 They can't take my words 
 It's all I've got (It's all I've got) 
 They can have this fame 
 It ain't worth a lot 
 Only thing I know, is I'll never let you go 
 Won't let you go 
 No, never gonna let you go 
 Won't let you go 
 No, never gonna let you go 
 Won't let you go 
 No, never gonna let you go 
 Won't let you go 
 No, never gonna let you go 
 Won't let you go 
 No, never gonna let you go 
 Won't let you go 
 No, never gonna let you go 
 Won't let you go 
 No, never gonna let you go 
 Won't let you go 
 Never gonna let you go
