[Intro] [B.O.B talking]: 
 Don't be afraid, when I die. Because... 
 I'm already gone 
 I'm already way way way up there 
 I'm already gone 
 I'm already gone as I'm way up there 
 I'm all alone 
 I'm all alone 
 I'm all alone 
 I'm all alone as I'm way up there 
 I'm already gone 
 [Verse One]: 
 I think I need to have somebody come and tell me I'm not as crazy 
 As much as I may be (may be?) 
 Maybe, things were better when I was just a baby (baby?) 
 Cause baby, ha 
 Ignorance is bliss, the older I get, I guess I get too curious 
 Lookin' on the Internet for interestin' shit that just way too serious 
 Somewhere along the way 
 I done went way too far in space 
 And I guess, can't nobody see me here, 'cause I'm too far away 
 I said, somewhere along the way 
 I done went way too far in space 
 And I guess, can't nobody see me here, 'cause I'm too far away 
 I'm already gone 
 I'm already way way way up there 
 I'm already gone 
 I'm already gone as I'm way up there 
 I'm all alone 
 I'm all alone 
 I'm all alone 
 I'm all alone as I'm way up there 
 I'm already gone 
 [Verse Two]: 
 Some people don't ask why (nah) 
 But... I ask why, I ask why (why?) 
 And half the time I try to act right, so I don't catch a bad vibe (nah) 
 Up in the sky like an aeroplane (pwwwwn) 
 But no I ain't talkin' 'bout Mary Jane (nah) 
 And yes, there's only a few people that know what I mean when I say I'm everythang (ha) 
 Somewhere along the way 
 I done went way too far in space 
 And I guess, can't nobody see me here, 'cause I'm too far away 
 I said, somewhere along the way 
 I done went way too far in space 
 And I guess, can't nobody see me here, 'cause I'm too far away 
 I'm already gone 
 I'm already way way way up there 
 I'm already gone 
 I'm already gone as I'm way up there 
 I'm all alone 
 I'm all alone 
 I'm all alone 
 I'm all alone as I'm way up there 
 I'm already gone 
 Somewhere along the way 
 I done went way too far in space 
 And I guess, can't nobody see me here, 'cause I'm too far away 
 I said, somewhere along the way 
 I done went way too far in space 
 And I guess, can't nobody see me here, 'cause I'm too far away 
 I'm already gone 
 I'm already way way way up there 
 I'm already gone 
 I'm already gone as I'm way up there 
 I'm all alone 
 I'm all alone 
 I'm all alone 
 I'm all alone as I'm way up there 
 I'm already gone
