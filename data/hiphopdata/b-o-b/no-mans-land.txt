Well, I live in a no man's land. I don't know where I'm going, trying to gain a fan. 
 I hold on to whatever I can, 'cause the deeper I go, the quicker the sand.

 Yeah, and everything 
 It all comes crashing down 
 And every deed 
 It all comes back around 
 And every creek 
 And every single cloud 
 Becomes the sea 
 And it all comes crashing down 
 And in the midst of everything I drown 
 As the sky above comes crashing down 
 (Down down down) 
 And in the midst of everything I drown (drown drown) 
 As the sky above comes crashing down 
 Sweet dreams, I hold on to 
 Memories, I hold on to 
 I don't think they really, really understand 
 All the pain I feel, just to make them dance 
 And here I go, in the studio 
 Can you feel my heart, now can you feel my soul 
 That's the way that i, think with every line 
 And imma be that deep till the day I die 
 So if you feel me now, sing it one time 
 The doc said I need to take these every day 
 But I rather ride around in a chevrolet 
 I don't wanna pray I don't wanna meditate 
 I broke up with my girlfriend yesterday 
 If I wanted to I could do anything 
 I could rap a verse but I'd rather sing 
 Everything goes around like a boomerang 
 (Boomerang-rang-rang-boomerang-rang-rang -rang)

 (Down down down down down) 
 And in the midst of everything I drown (drown drown) 
 As the sky above comes crashing down 
 I try to hold on, on to everything 
 Sweet memories, but that was yesterday 
 I try to hold on, on to everything 
 Sweet memories, but that was yesterday 
 I try to hold on, on to everything 
 Sweet memories, but that was yesterday 
 I try to hold on, on to everything 
 Sweet memories, but that was yesterday 
 I try to hold on, on to everything 
 (Sweet dreams, I hold on to-o-o-o) 
 Sweet memories, but that was yesterday 
 (Memories, I hold on to-o-o-o) 
 I try to hold on, on to everything 
 (Sweet dreams, I hold on to-o-o-o) 
 Sweet memories, but that was yesterday 
 (Memories, I hold on to-o-o-o) 
 But that was yesterday.
