(B.o.B) 
 Yeah what's high? 
 Ha 
 And what's low? 
 *Whatsup* 
 Who? 
 Hey 
 It's B.O 
 Well if ya, lookin' for me I'm 
 Probably in metropolis 
 Ah, I do this for the love, so this is 
 Non profit shit um 
 I'm boardwalkin 
 So you can call this monopoly 
 Obviously, my approach to music ain't moderate 
 As, my macoma spits 
 I am the anomaly 
 I love all my haters, cause my haters is what got me here 
 Strangers "hey bobby" me 
 Groupies try to body me 
 But I'm in a different planet so excuse my astrology 
 But, there are no apologies 
 For dropping all these prophecies 
 Breaking over barriers, 
 You juggernauts ain't stoppin' me 
 Balance is symmetrical, I guess I'm just geometry 
 Guess I'm just atomically built the way that I bomb on the beat 
 Bomb on the beat, you slide on to beat 
 We slide on our feet 
 We tightrope 
 I don't need no optometry 
 I do this in a blindfold 
 Honestly, we live the type of life people would die for 
 So we keep on tippin every second, *Yeah* we tightrope 
 Baby baby baby 
 Whether you high 
 Or low 
 Baby whether you high or low 
 You got to tip on the tightrope 
 Now let me see you do the tightrope 
 And I'm still tippin on it 
 (Lupe Fiasco) 
 Greetings. 
 Welcome to the meeting of the minds 
 That be thinking all the time 
 Bout defeating all the blind 
 Following, swallowing, drinking of the time 
 Honored traditions, of, 
 Keeping in a line 
 I prefer to figure eight 
 And then after that rock, 
 Rock all night 
 Till the candles on my mantle stop 
 And it's getting programming on 
 Every single channel watched 
 Televised revolutionaries on the chapel top 
 Shouting, 
 Down in Babylonian accounting 
 Medieval mathematics keep us average in amounting 
 But I surpass that. 
 I dropped out of their math class. 
 I am 'cause I thought 
 Now my tightrope is like a sidewalk 
 Baby baby baby 
 Whether you high 
 Or low 
 Baby whether you high or low 
 You got to tip on the tightrope 
 Now let me see you do the 
 Tightrope 
 (Janelle Monae) 
 Now now now now... 
 I can rhyme with the fellas 
 And rock a stage acapella 
 Never, can ya hear me 
 I am unpredictable like the weather 
 Ta ta talking about me 
 I stay floated like a feather 
 Jump on a elevator baby we on then ext level 
 Album just dropped and I've been on 
 Cover (covers) 
 Black and white tux, ain't no need for no other colors 
 Ta ta talking about, "why don't she change her clothes?" 
 Well they ain't seem to mind the last 3 times I posed in vogue 
 Some people get high 
 And then some people get low 
 Well I'm gon keep in the middle 
 So my people could know 
 Underdawgs, stand up tall 
 'Cause I'm talkin' to y'all 
 I can pose, I balance all 
 Like I'm Dominique Dawes 
 And I'm gone! 
 High 
 Or low 
 Baby whether you high or low 
 You got to tip on the tightrope 
 Now let me see you do the 
 Tightrope 
 Baby baby baby whether you high 
 Or low 
 Baby whether you high or low 
 You got to tip on the tightrope 
 Now let me see you do the 
 Tightrope 
 And I'm still tippin on it
