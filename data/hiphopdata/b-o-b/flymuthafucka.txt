Niggas don't like when you fly as fuck 
 But I'm fly as fuck 
 When they see my face they be lighting up, up 
 They be lookin' till their hair gets stuck 
 When they comin' out their socks and such 
 Who'd do it how I do it hah? Nobody does 
 Can I have swag without being stopped for it? 
 I board 1st class, ye ain't even lookin' at my boarding pass 
 Till ya find out who I was 
 Now you want a photograph, a photograph 
 Haters on my back, like some shoulder pads 
 Nigga finna snap like a quarterback 
 Yeah they know I'm fly but they hope I crash, hope I crash 
 If anybody else got something to say 
 Get in line, motherfucker 
 I swear to God I'm always on a hater's mind 
 Don't know why, I guess it's 
 'Cause I'm a Fly muthafucka 
 I'm a Fly muthafucka 
 Fly muthafucka, Fly muthafucka 
 I swear I'm always on a hater's mind 
 Don't know why, I guess it's 
 'Cause I'm a Fly muthafucka 
 I'm a Fly muthafucka 
 Fly muthafucka 
 Okay now watch me fly, mothafucka 
 I swear I'm always on a hater's mind 
 Don't know why, I guess it's 
 'Cause I'm a Fly muthafucka 
 I'm a Fly muthafucka 
 Fly, fly, that nigga so fly 
 Y'all niggas so weak 
 Y'all niggas just blah 
 They don't understand 
 'Cause you're just so blind 
 I do this for the days 
 When I had just enough to get by 
 Now I got more than enough to get by 
 But I got more than enough on my mind 
 Just lost a loved one the other night 
 Just got home and another one died 
 I don't even have the tears to cry 
 Tryna find gold in a diamond mine 
 'Cause diamonds are harder and harder to find 
 Ain't no one left for me to call 
 Ain't no more numbers on my line 
 Tell me how high must I climb 
 You fuck niggas stay on line 
 But I don't really have the time 
 I don't really have the time 
 If anybody else got something to say 
 Get in line, motherfucker 
 I swear to God I'm always on a hater's mind 
 Don't know why, I guess it's 
 'Cause I'm a Fly muthafucka 
 I'm a Fly muthafucka 
 Fly muthafucka, Fly muthafucka 
 I swear I'm always on a hater's mind 
 Don't know why, I guess it's 
 'Cause I'm a Fly muthafucka 
 I'm a Fly muthafucka 
 Fly muthafucka 
 Okay now watch me fly, mothafucka 
 I swear I'm always on a hater's mind 
 Don't know why, I guess it's
