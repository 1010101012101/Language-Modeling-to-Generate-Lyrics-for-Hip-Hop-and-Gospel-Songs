Systems go 
 Satellite, Satellite 
 Minus 10 
 Twilight, Twilight 
 I feel the moon 
 Pulling me away 
 Into the blue 
 Of the midnight sky 
 If you can do 
 You and I can do 
 Things they into 
 Just feel the vibe 
 So can we get a systems go 
 And blast off like a 
 Satellite, satellite 
 Launching in minus 10 [T minus 10] 
 Headed straight to the 
 Twilight Twilight 
 So can we get a systems go 
 And blast off like a 
 Satellite, satellite 
 Launching at minus 10 [T minus 10] 
 Headed straight for the 
 Twilight Twilight 
 Well as I'm headed to the sky way up above me 
 I feel my body spinning feeling free and lovely 
 I am the rumblin sea so come with me 
 On this midnight vibe 
 And you can feel it if you tune into your radio 
 Look at the sky look at the moon look at the way it glow 
 I ain't no ghost so don't be afraid to go 
 On this midnight vibe 
 So can we get a systems go 
 And blast off like a 
 Satellite, satellite 
 Launching in minus 10 [T minus 10] 
 Headed straight to the 
 Twilight Twilight 
 So can we get a systems go 
 And blast off like a 
 Satellite, satellite 
 Launching in minus 10 [T minus 10] 
 Headed straight for the 
 Twilight Twilight 
 Like an astronaut floating off into the beyond 
 Enterin into dimensions no one has ever yet seen before 
 I do not need an engine I can ascend into the dark 
 Remember a dream is never a dream is never a dream [is never a dream y'all] 
 Midnight vibe 
 So can we get a systems go
