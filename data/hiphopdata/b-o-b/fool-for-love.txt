Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
 She callin me back to her mattress 
 Back was like backflips we practice gymnastics 
 We got attached to the fact we attracted 
 You know I'm an addict and 
 My soul is a magnet 
 So if you get close then you can't go backwards 
 I know I'm kinda like a black hole in a galaxy 
 You are trapped beneath my galactic habits 
 I couldn't even notice the patterns, damn 
 But I was just so blind 
 You haven't called up at the perfect time 
 But I couldn't see it. I said I couldn't see it 
 Eventually I had to wisen up and open up my eyes 
 But I couldn't believe it, the way you looked was so deceivin 
 'Cause I was a fool for love 
 Who sadly fell in love 
 With a girl who couldn't love 
 With a girl who couldn't love 
 And now I'm sad in love 
 'Cause I'm not the only one 
 And I'm beatin' myself for love 
 For the girl who couldn't love 
 'Cause I was a fool for love 
 Yeah I was a fool for love 
 Yeah I was a fool for love 
 Yeah I was a fool for love 
 'Cause I was a fool for love 
 Hola bobby (hey) 
 Lemme tell ya bout my ex 
 But yet so fly mommy 
 I probly had the chance to exit stage 
 Left with her sister but whenever she left I would miss her 
 Lady dropped me like a cut in a track 
 Cuddlin cats who love they cat 
 A puzzlin accent, was she from scandenavia 
 Or fantasia from asia. 
 Click the mouse. I took a second ta figure it out 
 Thinkin' it out, kissin', adrenaline in her mouth 
 Is it about you? her? or is it somethin' super? 
 Silly me still in love with a cougar! 
 But I was just so blind 
 You haven't called up at the perfect time 
 But I couldn't see it. I said I couldn't see it 
 Eventually I had to wisen up and open up my eyes 
 But I couldn't believe it, the way you looked was so deceivin 
 'Cause I was a fool for love 
 Who sadly fell in love 
 With a girl who couldn't love 
 With a girl who couldn't love 
 And now I'm sad in love 
 'Cause I'm not the only one 
 And I'm beatin' myself for love 
 For the girl who couldn't love 
 'Cause I was a fool for love 
 Yeah I was a fool for love 
 Yeah I was a fool for love 
 Yeah I was a fool for love 
 'Cause I was a fool for love 
 Oh oh oh oh...
