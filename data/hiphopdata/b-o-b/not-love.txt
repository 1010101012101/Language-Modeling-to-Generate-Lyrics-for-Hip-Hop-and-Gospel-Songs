 [Verse One]: 
 Well every single mornin' down by them tracks (uh huh) 
 There was a dude name Kenny who was sellin' them sacks (got that work) 
 Client after client they would come right back (what's up) 
 He'd give 'em the stuff and they'd give him the cash (yes!0 
 Now Kenny's on his hustle, yeah, he's on his grind (uh huh) 
 Money's on his mind, strictly all of the time (get money) 
 But there was one customer who would come to buy (what's up) 
 He was lookin' for ice, not nicks, not dimes (okay) 
 He ain't no his name so he called him Chuck (Chuck) 
 And he was in the Benz when he pulled up (eerrr) 
 He wasn't from the hood he just passin' by 
 Black shoes, black car, black shirt, black tie (what's happenin') 
 So Chuck pulled off and the po' pulled up 
 Wasn't no where to go so Kenny was stuck (damn!) 
 And now he's in the precinct sittin' in cuffs 
 Just waitin' for the trail date (trail date) 
 Well early in the mornin' when the sun comes up (what's up?) 
 Kenny's on the corner sellin' meth to Chuck (uh huh) 
 Now Chuck's headin' back to Los Angeles 
 Remember everything's not, everything's not 
 "Thing's not love" 
 Well early in the mornin' when the sun comes up (what's up?) 
 Kenny's on the corner sellin' meth to Chuck (uh huh)

 (Verse Two) 
 Well in the city of L.A. around Beverly Hills (uh huh) 
 On top of the mountain there's a beautiful crib (uh huh) 
 A man and his wife and his family lives (uh huh) 
 He get a decent salary, he payin' the bills (huh) 
 But everythang just ain't what it seems (naw) 
 Outside lookin' in, it's the American Dream (uh huh) 
 Behind closed doors, he's really a fiend (oh) 
 Addicted to meth and he snorts? 
 So one day he pulls up to work (errrp) 
 Hops out this car and he fixes his shirt 
 He walks in and the whole room just rises (rise) 
 The honorable Chuck Blumstein presides (be seated) 
 Oh, and what a pleasant surprise (huh?) 
 Kenny sits down right in front of his eyes (ain't that you?) 
 But he don't hesitate, looks him right in his face 
 And with three hits of his gavel, he seals his fate 
 "Ooh yeah" 
 "Everything's not" 
 "Ooh yeah" 
 "Everything's not love"
