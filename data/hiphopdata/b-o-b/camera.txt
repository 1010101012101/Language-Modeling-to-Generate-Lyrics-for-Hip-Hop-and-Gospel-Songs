Okay this is very simple... 
 I come in you take your clothes off and I take pictures 
 Hmmk? 
 She gets up and takes a shower 
 Now she is in the mirror for hours 
 By the way she is a model of course 
 Hair all made up and makeup powered up 
 Walkin' on a runway 
 But she don't know where she goin' 
 She's just hopin' 
 That she keeps rollin' 
 Childhood broken 
 10 years later now she's a hoe and 
 Everybody wonder why does she act so cold 
 Cause that attitude ain't natural 
 Leave that drama 
 On that there door 
 Because I'm really not into that there for 
 Watch her take off her bra 
 Closing like a stall 
 Smiling for the camera (camera) 
 Ah she's a movie star 
 With that runway walk 
 Just smilin' for that camera (camera) 
 (Get work get work get) 
 She from my town far away 
 Then she moves to the A 
 To go to Georgia State 
 Then she got turned out 
 Then she dropped out 
 Now she is a actress to balls 
 To sang but ain't that pretty 
 She just trying to mimic the life in the city 
 Trying to keep up with that lime like livin' 
 Just wishin for one audition and video position 
 But that ain't how she used to be and 2 or 3 
 But no she is a hoochie freak so 
 Now they wonder if you will see 
 A little ole cutie with a booty booty 
 Darling, why the long face? why the long face? 
 Everybody loves you girl. Everyone loves you. 
 You know your gunna be legendary one day. 
 Watch her take off her bra 
 Closing like a stall 
 Smiling for the camera (camera) 
 Ah she's a movie star 
 With that runway walk 
 Just smilin' for that camera (camera) 
 (Get work get work get) 
 She dropped out of school at 16 anti-abortion 
 And dad is mixin 
 Then she got her a job at wendys 
 2 years later she's in there strippin 
 Twurkin that Money 
 Just to make her some daycare money 
 And to pay for the rent bill monthly 
 Her son is sayin' that ain't my mommy 
 But but 15 years down the line 
 She ain't the same as she's past her prime 
 Now it's all goin' down the drain 
 Say goodbye to all the fame 
 On behalf of WorldWide Inc. 
 I'm sorry to inform you that we will no longer 
 Be needing your modeling services darling 
 That's the way the cookie crumbles 
 Stiff up the upper lip? hmm? 
 Watch her take off her bra 
 Closing like a stall 
 Smiling for the camera (camera) 
 Ah she's a movie star 
 With that runway walk 
 Just smilin' for that camera (camera) 
 Watch her take off her bra 
 Closing like a stall 
 Smiling for the camera (camera) 
 Ah she's a movie star 
 With that runway walk 
 Just smilin' for that camera (camera)
