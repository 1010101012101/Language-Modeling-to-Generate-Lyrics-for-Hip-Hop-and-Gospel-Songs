Can't say her name but we were two 
 I grabbed her waist and we would move 
 And then one day we were through 
 And by the way I must be true 
 Cause all I ever wanted was to act on my attraction 
 I never meant to hurt you that's just my natural reaction 
 Life's just like a roller coaster, just like a roller (roller) 
 Life's just like a roller coaster, just like a roller (roller) 
 Okay okay okay okay I know I know 
 You ain't seen me ina while and you tryin' to figure out just where the hell did I go 
 Well I liked you I ain't just want sex 
 Well I ain't even goin' flex 
 First time you walked by everybody scream hair squad on deck 
 But you still was cool I'm a get real with you 
 Between b.o.b. and bobby ray 
 Which one appeal to you 
 But I ain't too mad cause at the end of the night 
 You still [?] 
 But this the least I can do 
 So this right here's for you 
 Cause all I ever wanted was to act on my attraction 
 I never meant to hurt you that's just my natural reaction 
 Life's just like a roller coaster, just like a roller (roller) 
 Life's just like a roller coaster, just like a roller (roller) 
 C'mon don't act like that 
 Cussin me out like I'm a call you back 
 You the one at the bar in the back 
 Tryin' to figure out where all the ballers at 
 And all that ass got you caught us fast 
 And you came back with us and we all got smashed 
 Funny how an autograph turned into all of that 
 Just call me the bedroom bandit 
 Cause after one night stands I vanish 
 And no I can't understand it 
 I don't think one man on this planet does 
 I'm just sayin' that even though we lookin' for panties 
 We still want a girl at home who can fix up a good ol' sandwich 
 Cause all I ever wanted was to act on my attraction 
 I never meant to hurt you that's just my natural reaction 
 Life's just like a roller coaster, just like a roller (roller) 
 Life's just like a roller coaster, just like a roller (roller)
