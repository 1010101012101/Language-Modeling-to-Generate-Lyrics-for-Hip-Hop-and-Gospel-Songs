You're all dressed up, and nowhere to be 
 Like beating drums, your heart never sleeps 
 We've been dancing all night, dancing machine 
 From the club to the floor, to your limousine 
 Ooh-ooh-ooh [x8] 
 I love all your nuances, I love all your nuances 
 Forgive me if I'm too honest girl that booty humongous baby you must do lunges 
 And up top two congas, girl you rarer than a blue comet 
 I'ma, keep it a million like two commas 
 I wanna beat it up like Ali, Muhammad 
 Girl you're too dope, you're too chronic, you keep it two hundred 
 Two piece, that's two freaks, that's two gins and two tonics 
 Who run it, No Genre you dumby 
 She love the whole crew so she paid the crew homage 
 Smelling like new money, new money 
 KL to Joburg we just played a few countries 
 Get out your seat hit the floor put your groove on it girl 
 You're all dressed up, and nowhere to be 
 Like beating drums, your heart never sleeps 
 We've been dancing all night, dancing machine 
 From the club to the floor, to your limousine 
 Ooh-ooh-ooh [x8] 
 What you looking for? 
 Party girl, you want it girl 
 You run yo mouth, not hooking up 
 And put it down we go see 
 What you really bout? 
 One time, hit you with it one time 
 No strings attached but you tongue tied 
 Give me my guitar g string I'mma strum 
 She gon need a salon, [?] 
 Ay back it up, see the rum dry 
 She gonna get deep like the dumb kind 
 She brought a lil' tree like bonsai 
 She gon learn today, I'm the alumni 
 Ay she's a drug that I've taken so much of 
 So much of, I could barely get a buzz off a pub 
 A puff ain't enough, looking for a substance to touch 
 Or a substance [?] in this club 
 Heat it up till you blush 
 Feel the rush feel the rush 
 Is it love is it lust? 
 I'll be the judge 
 Give ya body a rub 
 You're all dressed up, and nowhere to be 
 Like beating drums, your heart never sleeps 
 We've been dancing all night, dancing machine 
 From the club to the floor, to your limousine 
 Ooh-ooh-ooh [x8]
