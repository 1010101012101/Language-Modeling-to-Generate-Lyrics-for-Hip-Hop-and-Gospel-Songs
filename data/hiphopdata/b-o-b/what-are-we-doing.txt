It's been a long time coming 
 And the clock says a quarter to 4 
 I'm feeling like it's now or never 
 And your bodies telling me it's a go 
 So what are we doing? 
 What are we doing here? 
 What are we doing? 
 What are we doing here? 
 What are we doing? 
 What are we doing here? 
 What are we doing? 
 What are we doing here? 
 What are we doing? 
 On a late night weekend showcase event 
 Kind of liked you at first but I noticed your friend 
 So I got my folks to approach both of them 
 And they both came over and we poured up some hen 
 And we ain't say much, but we spoke 
 Cause you don't have to speak when you know 
 Their eyes said to me, systems go 
 It's about that time we should go 
 So allow me to flow as I propose a toast 
 To the good life on a good night we go 
 Grab a bottle and go tell her hold on 
 Yes a beautiful night 
 Colorful Kodak photo 
 But as soon as you went to the room I guess you froze 
 It's been a long time coming 
 And the clock says a quarter to 4 
 I'm feeling like it's now or never 
 And your bodies telling me it's a go 
 So what are we doing? 
 What are we doing here? 
 What are we doing? 
 What are we doing here? 
 What are we doing? 
 It's the end of the week but the first of the month 
 When the moon gets full but the night is still young 
 With a crowd like this you don't know where you'll end up 
 So I just play cool, like the cubes in my cup 
 Huh, but then you came through tryin' to body me up 
 And I didn't know what you were thinking 
 But your eyes said enough 
 And everything we felt was obvious lust 
 Which I thought was kinda cool I ain't gonna bluff 
 But look at the clock 
 It's about the time that I duck outta of the door 
 No need to be in a rush 
 But later you can hit me up so you hit me up 
 Shoes at the door smoke in the air temperatures up 
 But I guess when the lights went out it froze you up 
 It's been a long time coming 
 And the clock says a quarter to 4 
 I'm feeling like it's now or never 
 And your bodies telling me it's a go 
 So what are we doing? 
 What are we doing here? 
 What are we doing? 
 What are we doing here? 
 What are we doing?
