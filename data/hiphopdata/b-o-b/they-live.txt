On the weekday 
 Don't be surprised, don't be surprised 
 Walk like us 
 They even talk like us 
 Walk wa-walk like us 
 But they are not like us 
 On the weekday 
 You can see the signs, you can see the signs 
 They wear the disguise 
 Look into the mind's eye 
 There's nowhere to hide 
 Frosting covered lies 
 Whispers from afar 
 We know who you are 
 Windows to the stars 
 Walk like us 
 They even talk like us 
 Walk wa-walk like us 
 But they are not like us 
 On the weekday 
 You can see the signs, you can see the signs 
 Don't be surprised 
 On the weekday 
 Read between the lines, read between the lines 
 They wear the disguise 
 Look into the mind's eye 
 There's nowhere to hide 
 Frosting coated lies 
 Whispers from afar 
 We know who you are 
 Windows to the stars
