Well this is the mysterious case 
 Of Dr.Aden 
 Looking after her patients was her only obligation but 
 That was back before back before the situation 
 Before she got a visit from an agent 
 He introduced himself as an employee of the nation 
 He asked would she'd be willing to offer cooperation 
 You fit the job description and all the qualifications 
 If interested I need your signature on this paper 
 She signed the dotted line without the slightest hesitation 
 She then received a letter stating the rules and regulations and the military bases where she must be relocated 
 She is not to discuss any business that's work related 
 It's central America 
 On a classified location 
 Before border control 
 Before a illegal immigration 
 Inside a lab where 
 Chemicals are manipulated 
 Is where we see Dr.Aden 
 She's very concentrated 
 But her concentrations broken 
 When she hears a conversation 
 Down the halls 
 Small talk about destabilization and 
 Outta curiosity she wanders from her station 
 Inside a unlocked office she did some investigation 
 She breaks into a file with 
 Top secret information 
 Probably some of the most disturbing documentation 
 She ever saw in her life 
 The article simply stated 
 A study being conducted on human civilization 
 Deep down inside she wished it was all her imagination 
 She couldn't doubt it 
 Cause there it clearly stated 
 She works in a facility where viruses are created 
 And not only that 
 But member when she had her patients 
 She wrote out prescriptions for what she thought was medication 
 Her office was really just a part of the operation 
 She wipes her eyes as they water full of frustration 
 How a victim of government experimentation 
 Where's the justification 
 Where's the justification 
 Where's the judge when you need him 
 Hes probably on a vacation 
 Probably inside of the same countries that these events takes place in 
 But as the puzzle pieces fall into proper arrangement 
 Yes we began to see the intentions of these creations 
 The patterns of epidemics like 
 H.I.V. in the 80's 
 Biological chemicals designed to be contagious 
 There"s nothing in a business of controlling the population
