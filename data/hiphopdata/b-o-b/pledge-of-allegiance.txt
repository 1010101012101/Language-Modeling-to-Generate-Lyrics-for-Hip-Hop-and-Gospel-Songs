I pledge allegiance to the flag 
 Of the United States of America 
 Money fallin' from the 
 Money fallen' from the sky sky 
 Money fallin' from the 
 Money fallin' from the sky sky 
 Money fallin' from the 
 Money fallin' from the sky 
 Trying to get some money put your motherfucking hands high 
 Money fallen 
 Look at all this money fallen 
 I throw money in the air 
 Because I'm ballin' 
 Bitch I go hard I put my all in 
 If my phone ring that's money calling 
 Smell my weed it come from Cali 
 All my rings are filled with diamonds 
 Smoke a lot of marijuana on the top because the timin' 
 Haters mad at what I got because I grindin' 
 Now they say that he got game I make it rain like Jesus Christ 
 Money Fallin' from the sky like rain 
 Right now I'm just tryin' to get me some 
 Everybody wants to get paid 
 Counting so much money our figures numb 
 Dollas, Dollas, Dollas hoorah 
 That's why every night we wanna be in the club 
 Nobody ain't tryin' to save 
 Spend each and every dollar as soon as it comes, baby 
 Money fallin' from the 
 Money fallen from the sky sky 
 Money fallin' from the 
 Money fallin' from the sky sky 
 Money fallin' from the 
 Money fallin' from the sky 
 Trying to get some money put your motherfucking hands high 
 Money fallin' from the 
 Money fallen from the sky sky 
 Money fallin' from the 
 Money fallin' from the sky sky 
 Money fallin' from the 
 Money fallin' from the sky 
 Trying to get some money put your motherfucking hands high 
 Hoopin' 365, call that consistent ballin' 
 No carpet that's alpaca nigga you gotta blot it 
 Ain't in this for profit 
 But since I got it I'm poppin' 
 My lyrics may seem misguided to the petite and simple minded 
 But I'm so out this world 
 Yeah nigga be sola flexin' 
 When it come to this cash man 
 I ain't use no discretion 
 Dollas dollas dollas 
 Just part of me gotta chase em 
 See my arrested developments probably the ones a playin' 
 My blatant void of concern to prepare for an obligation 
 I stared death in the face and told 'em prepare for annihilation 
 And I always had ambition 
 Couldn't nobody tell me nothin' 
 I was on the hustle since I was this big 
 Money fallin' from the 
 Money fallen' from the sky sky 
 Money fallin' from the 
 Money fallin' from the sky sky 
 Money fallin' from the 
 Money fallin' from the sky 
 Trying to get some money put your motherfucking hands high 
 Money fallin' from the 
 Money fallen' from the sky sky 
 Money fallin' from the 
 Money fallin' from the sky sky 
 Money fallin' from the 
 Money fallin' from the sky 
 Trying to get some money put your motherfucking hands high 
 Land of the free 
 Home of the brave 
 There's money to make 
 That's what it takes, what it takes 
 Here in the U.S.A 
 Where the laws are made 
 Where crime still pays 
 There's money to make 
 That's what it takes 
 Here in the U.S.A 
 Ah ah ah 
 Money fallin' from the 
 Money fallen' from the sky sky 
 Money fallin' from the 
 Money fallin' from the sky sky 
 Money fallin' from the 
 Money fallin' from the sky 
 Trying to get some money put your motherfucking hands high 
 Money fallin' from the 
 Money fallen' from the sky sky 
 Money fallin' from the 
 Money fallin' from the sky sky 
 Money fallin' from the 
 Money fallin' from the sky 
 Trying to get some money put your motherfucking hands high
