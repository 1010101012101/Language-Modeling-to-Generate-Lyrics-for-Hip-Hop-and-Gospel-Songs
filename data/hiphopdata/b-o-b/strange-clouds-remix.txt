Remix nigga! 
 (Young Jeezy - Verse 1) 
 I've been drinking so much, my bitch said that you're an alcoholic 
 Everytime I find something, I'm good at you gotta spoil it 
 She said boy you need some help, damn right, you got it bad 
 I said bitch, we'll see the next time that I buy your ass a bag 
 Yeah, jizzle talk them birds 
 Last time he seen a brick 
 What the fuck he rapping about 
 Last time he had a hit? 
 In the pack I got it loud like? 
 Who the f-ck you talking to 
 All that yelling, all that screaming 
 What the f-ck you bout to do? 
 I don't do the lean, but what's up with them double cups 
 I say put vodka in both them muthaf-ckas, double up 
 I'm so high up in the clouds, I hope I make it home 
 I'm so f-cked up in the booth right now, I hope I make this song 
 All we do is pour it up 
 All night, drinks out 
 (That's how we do it) 
 (That's how we do it) 
 And all we do is light it up 
 All night, all you see is strange clouds 
 Strange clouds, strange clouds 
 (B.o.B - Verse 2) 
 On a private jet, left to right 
 I be coast to coastin' 
 Eh, I don't get throwed I just twist up and get rollercoasting 
 Eh, I'm gone, grandaddy, purp cologne, nigga, stop 
 So high I live in the sky, Leroy Jessie drone, nigga 
 Okay, if I ball, they dodge balling: elementary 
 I be smoking that old bun, that oval office, that presidency 
 She pop, her knees drop, cause these bottles are complimentary 
 All night we making history, paparazzi be documenting my clique 
 You sideline I'm headline, at the top 
 Take home the gold, then hit the bowl, I'm Mike Phelps 
 Raise out, with the prize belt, Olympic ganja, damn right 
 I'm 12.30, I'm groovy baby, all day, all night 
 All we do is pour it up 
 All night, drinks out 
 (That's how we do it) 
 (That's how we do it) 
 And all we do is light it up 
 All night, all you see is strange clouds 
 Strange clouds, strange clouds 
 (T.I - Verse 3) 
 Every time you see 'em, shawty going in 
 Go to jail, get back, here we go again 
 Back of that black Benz, getting to that dough again 
 Million, Grand Hustle real nigga, no pretend 
 Bank roll, can't fold, dough to the ceiling 
 And the legend where we living, bankhead brilliant 
 Ghetto bougie, with bitches with ghetto booty 
 Lets go cutie swagga so art deco 
 I echo Prada, Margiela, Louie 
 Blowing sticky icky 
 Get her gooey ooey 
 He say she won't licky licky 
 He don't know me do he 
 Ay truly, temper's just the coolest 
 Thought you knew this 
 Guess the proof is in how long a nigga do it 
 Ba-ba-bowww 
 All we do is pour it up 
 All night, drinks out 
 (That's how we do it) 
 (That's how we do it) 
 And all we do is light it up 
 All night, all you see is strange clouds 
 Strange clouds, strange clouds
