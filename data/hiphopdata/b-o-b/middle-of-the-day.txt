Ladies and gentlemen you are on Cloud 9 Airways. Please buckle your seatbelts and stay seated. Our departure will be around 4:20. Clear skies, sunny days. We are ready for takeoff. We have a go. 
 Wasn't much to do, I dipped outta school 
 Had to play it cool, I lit up that blue 
 And then I flew away, in the middle of the day 
 Man I gotta leave, I gotta escape 
 I can't stick around, gotta fly away 
 In the middle of the day, in the middle of the day 
 Look 
 Brain's at my window pane, it feels like I'm livin' in a video game 
 But ain't nothing changed, 'cause it's the middle of the day 
 Look 
 I said I'm puffin with my kin folk, gone off that endo 
 Just doin' that same old thing, with the same old gang 
 So can't nothin' change 
 Look 
 Every day the time goes by, passin me by 
 Paranoia on my mind, but I don't know why 
 Somethin' 'bout the times when I'm at the bank standin in line 
 Don't say much, keep a straight face 
 If I say somethin' I'm crazy 
 I think the government's onto me, onto me 
 Wasn't much to do, I dipped outta school 
 Had to play it cool, I lit up that blue 
 And then I flew away, in the middle of the day 
 Man I gotta leave, I gotta escape 
 I can't stick around, gotta fly away 
 In the middle of the day, in the middle of the day 
 Well I done sacrificed a lot 
 Just to get this rappin' life to pop 
 Meditatin on that after life 
 And if a tragic happens then I pass my life to stop 
 Cause a brand new life's beginning 
 But I ain't intending for it to be tremendous like this 
 The old one I had is ending, so so long I'm finished 
 Face to the floor getting so frustrated 
 Tryin' to figure out the right words to say 
 It's me and the clock I feel like I'm racin 
 Nobody knows the trouble I'm facin 
 Man I'm sick of waitin, gettin' impatient 
 Watchin my life unfold the pages 
 Ain't nothin' much I can do to stop it 
 That's why I'm blazin' 
 Every day the time goes by, passin me by 
 Paranoia on my mind, but I don't know why 
 Somethin' 'bout the times when I'm at the bank standin in line 
 Don't say much, keep a straight face 
 If I say somethin' I'm crazy 
 I think the government's onto me, onto me 
 Wasn't much to do, I dipped outta school 
 Had to play it cool, I lit up that blue 
 And then I flew away, in the middle of the day 
 Man I gotta leave, I gotta escape 
 I can't stick around, gotta fly away 
 In the middle of the day, in the middle of the day
