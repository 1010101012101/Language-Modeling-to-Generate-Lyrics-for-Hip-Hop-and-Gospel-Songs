(Verse One) 
 I was on Miami Beach 
 Saw the girl of my fantasy 
 She was into finer things 
 Bathing suits and diamond belly rings 
 She was something like I never seen 
 Made me blow the whistle like the referee 
 Beside her is where I plan to be 
 And so to get her I'd do anything 
 Maybe even start a family 
 Or even get a house in Sandy Springs 
 She's so lovely like a melody 
 So baby, won't you come and jam with me? 
 And she was so cool 
 Like the other side of a pillow 
 So baby, let's groove 
 Like an instrumental 
 (Verse Two) 
 Well come on over to my place 
 No need to be wasting time 
 You really must be from outer pace 
 Cause you really is blowing my mind 
 Now I done been from state to state 
 But I ain't never seen your kind 
 Cause every single time I look at you 
 Sends a tingling down my spine 
 Well girl, you must be mighty exhausted 
 Running these laps through my mind so often 
 'Cause I been fallin', and I been callin' 
 I think I need a map cause' I'm so lost in 
 The things you do when you brush your hair 
 When you take it to the side and toss it over there 
 And it ain't that fair, cause the way she move 
 I stare 
 And she was so cool 
 Like the other side of a pillow 
 So baby, let's groove 
 Like an instrumental 
 (Verse Three) 
 And she's so cool 
 Cool like a pool in the middle of June 
 I sweep her off her feet 
 I guess you could say that I give her the broom 
 And she gets so international with it 
 Whenever she get in the mood 
 'Cause she's so Australian 
 Down under on my didgeridoo 
 And she be killin' it too, yeah 
 When she go in for the gold 
 Like a gymnast move 
 Oh, and what they saying is true, yeah 
 A lady in the bed but a freak in the room 
 That's why she's cooly, cooly, cooly 
 Like a smoothie in a jacuzzi 
 The opposite of Judge Judy 
 When she on duty 
 And she feeling me too 
 And she was so cool 
 Like the other side of a pillow 
 So baby, let's groove 
 Like an instrumental
