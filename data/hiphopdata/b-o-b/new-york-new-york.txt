This is the finish my friend, this is the end 
 It's a revolution, it's a civilian revenge. 
 There's no need to move or adjust your television 
 Whenever an era dies, another era begins! 
 These American fights, these American wars, 
 These American stripes, these American stars, 
 But these American cages have American bars 
 We hunted for truth so we headed for y'all. 
 Towers are crumbling, bridges are falling, 
 Limits are fading, the normal is boring, 
 Looking at time move progressively forward 
 Looking the days just vanish before me. 
 You wanted a Benz but you couldn't afford it, 
 Now you were killed to put your foot in the tourist 
 It's a different madness and never look backwards 
 But this is the crisis, prepare for disaster! 
 Start spreading the news, 
 I'm leaving today! 
 I want to be a part of it 
 New York, New York, 
 New York! 
 Breaker breaker 9 breaker breaker 1 9 
 Could you please get an operator on the phone line? 
 This is not a riot it's way much more than that, 
 These people are dying we are under attack! 
 Wait let me call you back, let me get my stack 
 'Cause we ain't taking shit so therefore we'll fight them back 
 We ain't waiting on the line for a 9 1 1 9 9 
 Whatever man I ain't got time for all this nonsense. 
 Enemy responses ain't a dial tone in our home on the continent 
 Got me in these bandages, they jungle is our fundament 
 Man I swear they sleeping, they unconscious or they slumbering 
 So we break the peace to get a piece of what we want to get 
 Act like were new to this, like we can run with it. 
 Let them know we run this shit 
 And let them know just how you feel the way your country is 
 Now look how beautiful destruction is 
 Bang! 
 Start spreading the news 
 I'm leaving today! 
 I want to be a part of it 
 New York, New York 
 New York!
