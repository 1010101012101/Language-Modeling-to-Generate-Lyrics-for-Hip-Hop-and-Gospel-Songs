This shit right here is strictly for my niggas ridin' down Glenwood. 
 (DJ Scream. Hood rich beeotch.) 
 My niggas on Mooreland Ave. Boulder Cris. 
 You got six 12's in the trunk nigga this shit for you. 
 Let's go. (Hood rich hoe) 
 Well baby girl was lookin' at my ride 
 So I guess I'ma have to put her up inside 
 She was with you first now she's sittin' by my side 
 This is what happens every time I drive by 
 When I'm in that double bubble 
 They give me double bubble 
 When I'm in that double bubble 
 They give me double bubble 
 Yeah 
 (Verse One) 
 They see my whip and be like, "That's a mean motherfucker" 
 Smothered in cream, make her melt like butter 
 But I don't speak, I throw up the Eastside that mean "What up?" 
 Come in LZ, so put your system on 'Shut Up' 
 I hit the scene, real clean like scrub dum dum 
 They can't compete, they speakers bust the fuck 
 My kick got beat, they kicks be scuffed up 
 They beat, just fluff fluff 
 They weak and scrubbed up 
 They be like, "Who that is? Can you turn that down?" 
 'Cause they say I got too many 15's in my ride 
 And the Alpine is vibratin' they booty, chest and thighs 
 So girls be gettin' juicy wet when they get inside 
 Well, baby girl was lookin' at my ride 
 So I guess I'ma have to put her up inside 
 She was with you first now she's sittin' by my side 
 This is what happens every time I drive by 
 When I'm in that double bubble 
 They give me double bubble 
 When I'm in that double bubble 
 They give me double bubble 
 Yeah
