 (Verse 1: B.O.B.) 
 Cheaa 
 Yessir it's the beat from decatur, 
 Can't see in the knees of a hater, 
 Real sharp on my thing like a razor-blade come clean like a shape up, 
 So I guess I give the game a tape up, 
 But everybody gunna feel the need to say sum, 
 But can't speak up whenever you face em, 
 That's what you call microphone gangsta, 
 Yeah I got 'em okie dokie, yeah I'm raw you know my flow, 
 Cause both be actin' extra hard, like a viagra overdose, 
 Talkin' that noise on all them songs, a bunch of lil boys but y'all all look grown, 
 Those niggas die, and these niggas sell, it really don't matter, 'cause they all juss clones, 
 Go to school read a book be a lawyer, hell yeah man I'm off at a cause, 
 And I ain't tryna get involved with the law, so but a nigga will get caught mall spurse, that ain't just a threat on a song, don't get it I wrong I'm a captain my own, cause niggas that slip thing don't last long. 
 We got 'em goin' down for the count, 
 Lookin' at the ground, 
 That's why we got haters, that's why we got haters, 
 Haters everywhere we go, haters everywhere we go, haters everywhere we go, where we go, 
 Haters goin' down for the count, 
 Lookin' at the ground, 
 I think you're a hater, I think you're a hater 
 Haters everywhere we go, haters everywhere we go, haters everywhere we go, where we go, 
 Haters goin' down for the count

 Ooh you shoulda seen when I came down in that, black on black, 
 Plus it's gator, haters face down on the mat, hah splat yeah I can make a green nigga mad, quick, fast, flash like tin cash on his bitch ass, 
 You can tell I'm a g by the walk and the stance, high up in the game make him talk in this stance, watch how you talk when you talk to the man, 
 If it ain't about bread you can talk to the hand, I-I show you how to get rich,
