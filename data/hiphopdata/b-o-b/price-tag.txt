Seems like everybodys got a price, 
 I wonder how they sleep at night. 
 When the tale comes first, 
 And the truth comes second, 
 Just stop, for a minute and 
 Smile:) 
 Why is everybody so serious! 
 Acting so damn mysterious 
 You got your shades on your eyes 
 And your heels so high 
 That you can't even have a good 
 Time. 
 Everybody look to their left (yeah) 
 Everybody look to their right (ha) 
 Can you feel that (yeah) 
 Well pay them with love tonight... 
 It's not about the money, money, money 
 We don't need your money, money, money 
 We just wanna make the world dance, 
 Forget about the Price Tag. 
 Ain't about the (ha) Ka-Ching Ka-Ching. 
 Ain't about the (yeah) Ba-Bling Ba-Bling 
 Wanna make the world change, 
 Forget about the Price Tag. 
 (Listen, Okay.) 
 We need to take it back in time, 
 When music made us all UNITED 
 And it wasn't low blows and video Hoes, 
 Am I the only one gettin'... tired? 
 Why is everybody so obsessed? 
 Money can't buy us happiness. 
 If we all slow down and enjoy right now 
 Gurantee we'll be feelin' 
 All right. 
 Everybody look to their left (yeah) 
 Everybody look to their right (ha) 
 Can you feel that (yeah) 
 Well pay them with love tonight... 
 It's not about the money, money, money 
 We don't need your money, money, money 
 We just wanna make the world dance, 
 Forget about the Price Tags 
 Ain't about the (ha) Ka-Ching Ka-Ching. 
 Ain't about the (yeah) Ba-Bling Ba-Bling 
 Wanna make the world dance, 
 Forget about the Price Tag.
