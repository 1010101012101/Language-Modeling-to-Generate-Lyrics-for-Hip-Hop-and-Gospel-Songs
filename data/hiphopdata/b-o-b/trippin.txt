I got that high 
 Okay, all right, yeah yeah let's go yeah 
 Ah ha ha ah 
 I think I'm trippin' 
 Trippin' trippin' to the floor (thas right) 
 Feelin' different (different different) 
 Much more different then before 
 Yeah I'm trippin' (yeah I'm tripin') 
 From the ceiling to the floor 
 Feeling different 
 'Cause I'm trippin' to the floor 
 Trippin' to the floor 
 Trippin' to the flo 
 Started with no books and pages 
 Just stick it out in the hood I was raised in 
 Cause see the hood ain't no location 
 The hood is simply where you place me 
 See now when I look at faces 
 I give a damn and a good vibration 
 Cause there is no reason you should be faithless 
 Cause look how far a hook can take you 
 From up here earth looks amazing 
 That's ram invaded and human races 
 And there is no reason to debate it 
 I am the universe and your crazy 
 Now let's take a new vacation 
 I was thinking Jupiter Pluto maybe 
 See I ain't crazy 
 See I am just trying to wake up and I ain't patient
