Plain Jane 
 She didn't like Jane Plain 
 She was smiling to hide Jane's pain 
 But there was something about Plain Jane 
 Yes there was something about her. 
 She couldn't find her purpose 
 So she couldn't see her worth 
 Plain Jane [x10] 
 Yes there was something about her 
 Tell me Jane, why you can't look at the brighter things? 
 You think that you so plain, you hate your body and you want to exchange 
 So you go and do the doctor thing and the doctor asks what you want to change 
 You don't know, you can't explain, something about Plain Jane 
 She couldn't find her purpose 
 So she couldn't see her worth 
 Plain Jane [x10] 
 Yes there was something about her 
 But Jane's her name 
 As she lives in the souls of those 
 Who can't escape being vain 
 And she looks in the mirror in pain 
 And she feels ashamed 
 So strange 
 So wrapped up in the pain 
 She even hates her name 
 And she won't entertain the sunshine 
 Because her life, is rain 
 And she sick of playing all the games 
 But still she drowns, again 
 There's something about Plain Jane 
 Jane 
 Plain Jane 
 J-J-J-Jane 
 Plain Jane 
 She didn't like Jane Plain 
 She was smiling to hide Jane's pain 
 But there was something about Plain Jane 
 Yes there was something about Plain Jane 
 Plain Jane [x10] 
 Yes there was something about her.
