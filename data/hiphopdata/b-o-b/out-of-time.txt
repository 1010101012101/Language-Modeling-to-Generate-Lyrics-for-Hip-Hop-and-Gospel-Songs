(Verse 1: B.o.B) 
 Do-Do-Do Hello Neighbors 
 Wake up now or say your prayers 
 Put it down your newspaper 
 Hello there bad news anchor 
 We don't want no more favors 
 We ain't goin' die We ain't goin' lay low 
 To the sky is what we aim for 
 From Venus to Mars 
 From Venus to Mars 
 (Chorus x2: B.o.B) 
 The ticking clock The tick clock 
 Is counting down counting down 
 Like 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... 
 Your out of time out of time 
 (Verse 2: B.o.B) 
 Like a Tornado This world is goin' round 
 There's nothing to wait for 
 Don't let it weigh you down... down... down... down... 
 I need to release 
 Release all these demons 
 Screaming at me 
 They must be defeated 
 Eventually some time this century 
 Please pardon me cause me I'm just ventin' 
 But people will bleed if we don't come to grips with 
 These evil seas that we playin' with big business 
 They never solve it defenseless 
 And still we so senseless 
 (Chorus x2: B.o.B) 
 The ticking clock The tick clock 
 Is counting down counting down 
 Like 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... 
 Your out of time out of time 
 Like a Tornado This world is goin' round 
 There's nothin' to wait for 
 Don't let it weigh you down 
 Like a Tornado! This world is goin' round 
 There's nothin' to wait for 
 Don't let it weigh you 
 Down... down... down... down... down... down...
