 They tell me that I play a lot 
 But I don't think that they play enough 
 I don't know if I'm right or not 
 Tell me who ever stops growin' up 
 We're just big kids 
 The world's our toy 
 For boys and girls, for girls and boys 
 Tell me who ever stops growin' up 
 (B.o.B:) 
 Yeah, still ridin' big wheels, still addicted to J's 
 Favorite team on my fitted, in every color they make 
 I paint the town and every city I stay 
 ADD or you just never really learn how to play 
 A livin' breathin' walkin' memory on Memory Lane 
 Tell me are we really movin' or just dreamin' the place 
 What's today, outta space, still I'm searching something great 
 And the museum of broken toys, just trying to fill a void 
 Yeah, I wake up a different year, different peers, tables turned, I tried not to interfere 
 Yeah, shiftin' gear, tryna steer, things changed, see them getting smaller in my rear view mirror 
 Are you here, are you really here, can you hear me clear? 
 Biggest fear, hate to say goodbye, hate to disappear 
 Yeah, tell me are you really here 
 If it's just imagination, hate to see you disappear

 Yeah, how you expect to mean somethin' to the world if the world don't mean somethin' to you? Ay 
 Focusin' on all the negative, the only thing that's negative is somethin' in you, ay 
 We become the people that hurt us the most 
 That's why the saying is "keep your enemies close" 
 Stop givin' attention on what you don't wanna life or be prepared to experience it the most 
 I became everything I used to criticize 
 How'd I look inside the critics' eyes? 
 Yeah, but all roads lead home 
 We just to ride back at different time 
 Are you here, are you really here, can you hear me clear? 
 Biggest fear, hate to say goodbye, hate to disappear 
 Yeah, tell me are you really here 
 If it's just imagination, hate to see you disappear
