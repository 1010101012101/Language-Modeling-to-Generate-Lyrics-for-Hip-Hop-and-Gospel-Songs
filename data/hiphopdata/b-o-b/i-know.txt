 I know, I know, I know 
 You have been waitin' 
 I know, I know, I know 
 I know what you're waiting for 
 You'll think I'll make you a break-up song 
 That you really think you deserve it 
 And I know you've been longin' for 
 You'll think I'll make you a break-up... 
 (B.o.B:) 
 I know how you want this to go 
 I know how you want me to flow 
 You want to even this go 
 You want me to upload a post 
 You want me to go back and forth with the shit I did with a random lil' ho 
 You want me to... hm but would be doin' the most 
 They want to see a nigga deep in his feelings 'cause that's where they usually go 
 New bitches always got somewhere to go but that's what the Uber is for 
 Old bitches always be down for a setup but that's what my shooters is for 
 Bitches be so quick to side with a bitch like they never heard rumors before 
 I hate emotions, I ain't good with 'em 
 I only fuck with trouble, put that wood in 'em 
 I ain't good for 'em, ain't no sugarcoatin' shit, ain't no sugarcoatin' wood in 'em 
 From the hood but not a hoodlum 
 Lines got [?] suss in 'em 
 Bitches fall for anything you tell 'em, better get the pillow for some cushionin' 
 Like the Cushigan

 This ain't a love song or a fight or a break-up or a make-up song 
 This ain't a grudge song, this a "who can you trust" song (yeah) 
 Or "why are they thinkin' in blood" song 
 This ain't a club song, "Fontainebleau Miami revolt" song 
 This a "only guy can judge" song 
 "People care too much about who I fuck" song 
 "When you smokin' and discuss" songs 
 "That's something that should discuss" songs 
 This a "hush, you blowin' my bust" song 
 "Power usually corrupt" song (yeah) 
 "Two step in the ever-bud" song 
 This a "look at me in disgust" song 
 "Control yourself, take what you need but I ain't done" song 
 A palm for nurses, they had their scrubs on 
 "Things got too complicated for us" song 
 Shit, we should've left it in the crush zone 
 Yeah, but I couldn't leave well enough alone 
 Yeah, I couldn't leave well enough alone 
 Couldn't leave well enough alone 
 Now I'm singin' this fuckin' song
