Looking at the world from my rearview 
 Searching for an answer up high 
 Or is it all wasted time? 
 Everything is crumbling around me 
 Feels like the ending of the times 
 Or is it all just a sign? 
 Uh, I don't start from my notebook 
 Ever since, never woke up 
 Hey, I've been travelling for lifetimes 
 Still I got many miles 'fore it's over 
 Yeah, I kept on hunting like I'm spose to 
 But everything in the world ain't coshure 
 See it's crazy when your friends turn to strangers 
 But then strangers running up like they know you 
 And the further away from the other day I go 
 I can feel the truth getting closer 
 But hey, it's a path that we all on, 
 If you in the fast lane or the slow one 
 And you might break down on the shoulder 
 You just gotta know who the car for the toe-truck 
 I guess we all gotta exit to the next boulevard where the roads are 
 Looking at the world from my rearview 
 Searching for an answer up high 
 Or is it all wasted time? 
 Simulated automated break throughs 
 Everything appears to be fine 
 Or are we all digitized? 
 Everything is crumbling around me 
 Feels like the ending of the times 
 Or is it all just a sign? 
 Yeah, sometimes, sometimes I'm wondering 
 If what I'm seeing in front of me, is even real. 
 Yeah, go role up some of that killa 
 We call this slasher smoking, 
 Gone off those Michael Myers 
 I can barely keep my lashes open 
 6 shots of the rum I'm done 
 Thinking about my partners death 
 I'm angry, in a flash he was gone 
 Man how can that they not rearrange me 
 All of my days, they clouded 
 All of my nights, they roudy 
 He told me 'Tre keep suckers in the rib 
 If so then smash 'em proudly' 
 Is it all in my head? 
 Am I just wasting time? 
 All of my rearview mirror 
 Looking for answers 'bout to lose my mind 
 Looking at the world from my rearview 
 Searching for an answer up high 
 Or is it all wasted time? 
 Simulated automated breakthroughs 
 Everything appears to be fine 
 Or are we all digitized? 
 They say you only get one life time 
 Then it's gone in a blink of an eye 
 Or is it all just in my mind? 
 Everything is crumbling around me 
 Feels like the ending of the times 
 Or is it all just a sign? 
 I saw the lights dancing up so high 
 I wonder is it really a sign? 
 Or just imagination, imagination 
 Escorted flooded off the sky 
 Pouring from the sands of time 
 Congratulations, we finally made it
