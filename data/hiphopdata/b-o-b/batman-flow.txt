[Verse One] [B.O.B]: 
 Soon as I enter 
 You know who it is-a 
 It's the representer from the east side of Atlanta 
 That's known as Decatur 
 I got my own lane but I can't see the road 
 My rear view mirror's full of haters 
 Wouldn't wanna be ya 
 It's me they cannot battle 
 Yes I'm a mothership and you a boat without no paddle 
 Yes I am what they after 
 I'm a natural born disaster 
 I'm the reason your momma tell you not hang with rappers 
 But your momma is a minister and I'm her favorite rapper 
 Probably 'cause she found out that my daddy was a pastor 
 I wonder what she's after 
 But don't get it confused 
 There's no surprise, it's just another day in my shoes 
 Every other city we go 
 Every other city we go 
 It's just a different day with the same shit 
 It's just a different day with the same shit 
 Every other city we go 
 Every other city we go 
 Things just ain't what I used to know 
 Things just ain't what I used to know 
 [Verse Two] [B.O.B]: 
 Yeah, well these niggas salty 
 High blood pressure 
 If you got that sodium, nigga I got that pepper (Dr. Pepper) 
 Don't step up, please fall back 
 Y'all can't ball, all y'all are wack 
 Haters need hugs, you thugs need love 
 And groupies fall in holes that gold diggers dug 
 These niggas cynical 'cause I'm on there medicinal 
 Why they so sensitive, I guess they on their menstruals 
 I don't need no pencil though be consider a general 
 Regardless of my genre yes, I'm flawless man, in general 
 When I'm in the club 
 Girls be jigging on they tippy toes 
 So she take me in like her vitamins and minerals 
 You ain't on my signal, you analogue, I'm digital 
 Grand Hustle champion, someone turn my anthem on 
 When my jam come on, God damn I blow straight up, I am a bomb 
 Leaping over barriers like this was a triathlon 
 Every other city we go 
 Every other city we go 
 It's just a different day with the same shit 
 It's just a different day with the same shit 
 Every other city we go 
 Every other city we go 
 Things just ain't what I used to know 
 Things just ain't what I used to know 
 [Verse Three] [Donnis]: 
 Now I'm the everyday topic 
 I'm under the microscope so I'm feeling microscopic 
 My shit was fading to black 
 Niggas thought I was Gothic 
 But made it to the next step like recovering alcoholics 
 I bounce back like a Snoop Deville with hydraulics 
 Ain't +Nothin' But A G-Thang+ 
 Nigga I'm the king of pain 
 Veins filled with Novocaine 
 So I ain't even feeling y'all 
 I ain't even hearing y'all 
 Fingernails on a blackboard 
 They say the pen is way mightier than the sword 
 So I'm a spaz out to get inside the mental ward 
 Get my Grammy Awards 
 Till your faith is restored by the lord of this rap shit 
 Niggas got it backwards 
 Let's line up all the factors 
 Grew up in the hood but was raised in the burbs 
 Real pops wasn't there 
 So the military made me a man 
 And they told me, put my dreams in the can 
 But I still made it here, damn 
 Every other city we go 
 Every other city we go 
 It's just a different day with the same shit 
 It's just a different day with the same shit 
 Every other city we go 
 Every other city we go 
 Things just ain't what I used to know 
 Things just ain't what I used to know
