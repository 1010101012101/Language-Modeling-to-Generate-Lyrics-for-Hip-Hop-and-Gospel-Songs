(Sevyn Streeter:) 
 Love the way you're livin' baby, never wanna waste your time 
 Love it when you touch my body, makes me wanna give you mine 
 It's so wrong, but it feels so right 
 'Cause I love this feeling, and I love this life 
 Said I love this life, life, yeah 
 (B.o.B.:) 
 This is craziness, addicted to the pain of love and hate relationship 
 Or can I break I heart or can we argue breakin' shit? 
 I guess I take the fault for what my occupation is 
 The more the money come the more bizarre the day can get, bizarre the day can get 
 It cost bread to join the game but even more to escape the shit 
 I see calculated cowards taking calculated risks 
 This the art or making music or the art of faking shit? 
 This the truth, I give these boys the blues this is proof 
 But it's nothing they can tell me 
 It's nothing they can do to take my touch away, take my love away 
 I play to win, backstage 
 First we say the prayer, then we say amen, bands! 
 (Sevyn Streeter:) 
 Love the way you're livin' baby, never wanna waste your time 
 Love it when you touch my body, makes me wanna give you mine 
 It's so wrong, but it feels so right 
 'Cause I love this feeling, and I love this life 
 Said I love this life, life 
 It's so wrong, but it feels so right 
 'Cause I love this feeling, and I love this life 
 (Verse 2 - B.o.B.:) 
 This is craziness, this is craziness 
 [?] money before I make it, never learn to wait for shit 
 Tryna pack a stadium, you tryna catch the latest trends 
 The line between the good and bad is paper thin 
 Goodness gracious, I might have enemies in high places 
 They so famous, but can't keep up with how my mind races 
 How I'm steppin' on these niggas like I've got my own rep 
 Nigga be or make a [?] salutations to the haters [?] 
 You say what's up with me, what's up with you? 
 It's nothing they could tell me, it's nothing they can do to take my touch away, to take my love away 
 I play to win, swagger woodstock status, guess that's why they call me bands, bands!
