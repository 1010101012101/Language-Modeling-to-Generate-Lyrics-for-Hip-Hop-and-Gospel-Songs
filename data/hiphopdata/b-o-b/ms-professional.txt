You so professional 
 With yo 9 to 5 
 Try to make some revenue 
 Standing five foot five 
 Looking straight incredible 
 But the guys will be lying 
 Really they just scared of you 
 So girl I am telling you 
 Well give it to me right now 
 I could use your soul 
 And we can do it right now 
 Like we are all alone 
 And now you wait to do 
 The things we're made to do 
 What we're made to do we ain't ashamed 
 So girl give it to me right now 
 You're just like a pro 
 You know I am watching whenever you are on clock 
 I hope you'll never take a break I hope you won't stop 
 Imaginations of me on the bottom, you on top 
 Every single time you break it down you get them 
 Every time you dress you bless them 
 You fresh to death them 
 I guess I have to resurrect them think of all your killing 
 Cooler than a cucumber two thumbs up 
 With the high heels and your suit on yes you do you know 
 You're so professional 
 With your 9 to 5 
 Try to make some revenue 
 Standing five for five 
 Looking straight incredible 
 But the guys will be lying 
 Really they just scared of you 
 But girl I am telling you 
 Well give it to me right now 
 I could use your soul 
 And we can do it right now 
 Like we are all alone 
 And now you wait to do the things we're made to do 
 What we're made to do we ain't ashamed 
 So girl give it to me right now 
 You're just like a pro 
 You're doing it doing it 
 You know just what to do with that thing 
 You know just what to do with it do with it 
 You know just what to do with it that thing 
 You know 
 I like the way you move it move it 
 I like the way you move it with that thing 
 I like the way you move it move it 
 You're just like a pro 
 OK if I had a guess 
 I can tell by the way you type 
 By the way you dress 
 I can tell by the way you neatly stack them papers across that desk 
 If you ever get a guy like me 
 You will be better if you ever get [?] 
 Light on now bring your waist to the edge of the bed 
 I heard your accent that you are scratching [?] my name 
 That is it you know what I like 
 A business woman by day 
 Roxy Reynolds by night 
 But you're so professional 
 With your 9 to 5 
 Try to make some revenue 
 Standing five for five 
 Looking straight incredible 
 But the guys will be lying 
 Really they just scared of you 
 That's why I am telling 
 Well give it to me right now 
 I could use your soul 
 And we can do it right now 
 Like we are all alone 
 And now you wait to do 
 The things we're made to do 
 What we're made to do we ain't ashamed 
 So girl give it to me right now 
 You're just like a pro 
 I like the way you move it, move it 
 I like the way you move it with that thing 
 I like the way you move it move it

 Well give it to me right now

 And we can do it right now 
 Like we are all alone 
 And now you wait to do 
 The things we're made to do 
 What we're made to do we ain't ashamed 
 So girl give it to me right now 
 You're just like a pro
