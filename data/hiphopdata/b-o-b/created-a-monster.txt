Hawaaooooaaaaooooo hawaaooooaaaaooooo 
 Hawaaooooaaaaooooo hawaaooooaaaaooooo 
 Well I'm trapped on a roller coaster 
 And they won't let me go so it's totally bogus 
 And every single day it gets colder, colder 
 Till my mood get low like below the sofa 
 Can somebody tell me where to go? 
 Somewhere far away where it can't go wrong 
 There's way too many snakes on this globe 
 Now everybody sing it, everybody sing it 
 We created a monster, created a monster 
 But nobody wants some, but nobody wants some 
 Created a monster, created a monster 
 But nobody wants to kill it 
 So long 
 But since there's nowhere to go (nowhere to go) 
 I guess I'll be on the road (goodbye) 
 Wherever my soul will go (so long) 
 Goodbye, so long 
 (Where you goin'?) 
 Outer-spa-yaa-yaa-yaaace 
 Outer-spa-yaa-yaa-yaaace 
 Outer-spa-yaa-yaa-yaaace 
 Goodbye, so long 
 To get where I am I can give you directions 
 I'm in the future I can get with the Jetsons 
 I need to leave someone give me suggestions 
 Fuck elections, the whole planets infected 
 Uh, call the doctor I could use some direction 
 Uh, call the reverend I could make a confession 
 Built just like a subatomic nuclear weapon 
 Everybody say it, everybody say it 
 We created a monster, created a monster 
 But nobody wants some, but nobody wants some 
 Created a monster, created a monster 
 But nobody wants to kill it 
 So long 
 But since there's nowhere to go (nowhere to go) 
 I guess I'll be on the road (wazzup?) 
 Wherever my soul will go (that's what I thought) 
 Goodbye, so long 
 (Where you goin'?) 
 Outer-spa-yaa-yaa-yaaace 
 Outer-spa-yaa-yaa-yaaace 
 Outer-spa-yaa-yaa-yaaace 
 Goodbye, so long 
 (Ah Everybody sing it, everybody sing it, I said everybody sign it, sing it) 
 We created a monster, created a monster 
 But nobody wants some, but nobody wants some 
 Created a monster, created a monster 
 But nobody wants to kill it 
 So long 
 But since there's nowhere to go (nowhere to go?) 
 I guess I'll be on the road (on the road 
 Wherever my soul will go (haha) 
 Goodbye, so long 
 (Where you goin'?) 
 Outer-spa-yaa-yaa-yaaace 
 Outer-spa-yaa-yaa-yaaace 
 Outer-spa-yaa-yaa-yaaace 
 Goodbye, so long
