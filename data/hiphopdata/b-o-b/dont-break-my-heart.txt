 Hi, this Tasha you reached me at the wright number but at the wrong time you know what to do (beep) 
 (B.o.B) 
 And so I'm thinking to myself girl I need you 
 There ain't a price that you could pay to make me leave you 
 I get you anything and everything to please you 
 I'm standing outside of your window just to see you 
 You grap my heart and smash it down to the flo 
 Then you, you say you want me, then it's leave me alone. 
 So I'm asking myself if I did something wrong, 'cause you yelling, cussing, fussing now you hanging up the phone. 
 I say I love you once 
 I say I love you twice 
 I'mma be outside your house 
 I stay up all night 
 I'mma play this good time, gurl 
 To show you how I feel 
 Ha ha how I feel 
 Why do you Build me up 
 Buttercup baby 
 Just to let me down 
 And mess me around 
 And worst of all you never call, baby when you say you will 
 I love you still 
 I need you 
 I need you more than anyone, darling 
 You know that I have from the start 
 So Build me up 
 Buttercup don't break my heart 
 Well... 
 I'm reminicing on the thangs we'd um been through 
 Like that time you through that brick through my window 
 I swear to God around that time I coulda lynced you 
 Couple of hours later I wanted to hug, love and kiss you 
 You said you can't take it no more 
 But you didn't walk out of that door 
 You say that you change 
 But we fussing and fighting where ever we go 
 All out in public every body watching like a reality show 
 But it don't matter no more 
 'Cause you know I can't let you go 
 I say I love you once 
 I say I love you twice 
 I'mma be outside your house 
 I stay up all night 
 I'mma gonna play this good time, gurl 
 To show you how I feel 
 Ha ha how I feel 
 Why do you build me up 
 Buttercup baby 
 Just to let me down 
 And mess me around 
 And worst of all you never call, baby when you say you will 
 But I love you still 
 I need you 
 I need you more than anyone, darling 
 You know that I have from the start 
 So build me up 
 Buttercup don't break my heart
