 Oh they oh they know it's him

 I'm so out there I'm going up no more 
 Niggas still hate and I don't even know why no more 
 I don't know why, I don't know why 
 These niggas lame and I don't know why

 We ain't the same and I don't know why 
 Nothing is forever easy

 Now watch get in it, super gold ceiling, smoking on ignorant 
 Me, I'm so different, I just stand out, these niggas be blending in 
 They say I'm too hot, they say I'm too hood, now that's a predicament 
 But as you can see the path that I'm on, success is just imminent 
 But at least I know I'm gonna learn 
 And I know I know I got my work 
 You see these niggas out there and they sho is lurkin 
 'Cause this life ain't fair and it sure ain't perfect 
 I don't know why, I don't know why 
 These niggas lame and I don't know why 
 I don't know why, I don't know why 
 We ain't the same and I don't know why 
 Nothing is forever easy 
 Nothing is forever easy 
 Nothing is forever easy 
 So till I die I'll be forever livin'

 Nothing is forever easy 
 Nothing is forever easy 
 Nothing is forever easy 
 So till I die I'll be forever livin'
