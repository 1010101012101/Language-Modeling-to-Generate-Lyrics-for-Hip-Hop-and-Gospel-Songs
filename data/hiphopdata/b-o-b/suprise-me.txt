(B.O.B) 
 Well you know who it is 
 You ain't even got to ask it 
 I am not the best I am the next level past it 
 (x3) 
 Haters see me passing like damn that bastard (dammit) 
 'Cause they outta style like the water bed mattress 
 Yeah yeah, they thought I'd fade to the blackness 
 Now they see me everywhere like Samuel L Jackson (mothafucka) 
 But I ain't actin=', I'm only givin' classes 
 And by the looks of these grades niggas ain't passin' 
 No, it's crazy how these niggas think 
 They be actin' like I ain't like Howard in the paint 
 Like trees and Cali man, all I do is blaze 
 And they say I'm like a zombie 
 Cause all I want is brains 
 Mine 
 Yes, mine mine mine 
 Yeah you look good girl but what is on your mind? 
 Think about it 
 Cause all these dimes 
 Like Nationwide, they just wanna be on my side 
 But baby this is all I can provide 
 The whole town'll have water if I lay this pipe 
 I'm on top of the world and I'm so high 
 I gotta drop down just to catch my flight 
 Yikes 
 What amazing heights 
 Gee wilikers Batman, holy satellites 
 Who the hell are you to tell me ease up on this mic? 
 You, sadly have mistaken me for someone that I'm night 
 I mean not 
 I messed up 
 But I rock with this stuff 
 So my stocks just went up 
 You know my flow 
 Yeah it's B dot O 
 Yeah it's B dot O 
 Yeah it's B dot O 
 And you know my flow 
 Yeah I hear them talkin' with that raspy shit (shhh) 
 But what's an upper class man to a graduate? 
 I said {mumbling} and you laugh to it 
 I'm just playin' with these niggas I ain't mad at 'em 
 But since you critics want to be that adamant 
 I guess I give you reason to type on your keypad again 
 Yeah I buy buzz and got the whole web chatterin' 
 How ironic? In my past it ain't matter then 
 Well, it comes with the territory 
 My life is not an ordinary story 
 Naw, and I ain't talking big 
 This is just how I feel about the situation that I'm in 
 Yeah 
 No you can never walk in my shoes dawg 
 Even if I got my dude to make your shoes dawg 
 You know about that south we act like fools dawg 
 Your girl says she like that country smooth drawl 
 That's why there's groupies ready to remove draws 
 They be going heavy duty till that Goose gone 
 Every single day I wake up to a new song 
 That's the sound of my formal introdushon 
 I mean "tion" 
 What's up? 
 You know, my flow 
 'Cause it's B dot O 
 And it's B dot O 
 And it's B dot O 
 And you know, my flow 
 So to all the people that's about to hate it 
 Here's how I feel about you {burps} 
 There, I demonstrated 
 Ha, a politician so opinionated 
 So my style is addictive like simple lemonade is 
 I'm in the building and I'm finna hit the stage 
 You can feel the tension and the sense of mental stimulation 
 If she's with me than she's not your lady 
 And as we can see, she loves my babies 
 Me go so crazy 
 Me go so loco lately 
 Mostly because they raised me 
 No heat, no cold, no A.C. 
 Yeah I'm just saying how I feel up in this booth 
 One of y'all surprise me and do something new
