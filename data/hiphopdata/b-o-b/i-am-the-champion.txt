Incredible, incredible 
 Oh my God, ladies and gentlemen 
 You have just witnessed world history being made 
 Bobby Simmons, takes it to the hole, dunks it 
 Overtime three seconds left, oh, my God, yeah 
 I am the champion 
 I am the champion 
 Lights, cameras, action 
 Whenever I play 
 I say I am the champion 
 (I am the champion) 
 I am the champion 
 (I am the champion) 
 I say I am the champion 
 (I am the champion) 
 I am the champion 
 (I am the champion) 
 Okay, B.o.B, hit the stage now 
 Lights and cameras on 
 Yes, I'm givin' them want they want 
 But, no, I will not ever conform 
 'Cause I'm outside of the norm still 
 What a spectacular form 
 From the blood, sweat and the tears shed 
 Every time I perform 
 And whenever your doin' your thang 
 Yeah, people gon' hate on it as usual, that's right 
 But I'm just as human as you 
 I just look good while doin' it 
 And they telling me I have so much dough 
 I won't know what to do with it 
 Well, until then, I'm gonna continuin' numberin' because 
 I am the champion 
 I am the champion 
 Lights, cameras, action 
 Whenever I play 
 I say, I am the champion 
 (I am the champion) 
 I am the champion 
 (I am the champion) 
 I say I am the champion 
 (I am the champion) 
 I am the champion 
 (I am the champion) 
 I look in the mirror and laugh 
 Like look at what I've become 
 Everyone calls me B.o.B but 
 I'm still my mother's son 
 And I'm low key when I'm out now 
 Hell no fame ain't fun 
 But I stay live like NBA on yo play station 
 And I entertain 'cause I'm in the game 
 Man, it's easy to see I ain't into fame 
 'Cause I ain't 
 And critics say that I imitate but I really can't 
 Please allow me to demonstrate 
 But no matter what they say 
 I stay charged up like a triple A 
 Really, mayne? Really, mayne 
 I am the champion 
 (I wake up and piss excellence) 
 I am the champion 
 (All day) 
 Lights cameras action 
 (Please hold your applause) 
 Whenever I play 
 (I'm kind of a big deal) 
 I say I am the champion 
 (I am the champion) 
 I am the champion 
 (I am the champion) 
 I say I am the champion 
 (I am the champion) 
 I am the champion 
 (I am the champion) 
 It seems like the crowd is pandemonium 
 This is pandemonium, the crowd is rushing the court 
 And it seems like they're returning something 
 What? What? Can we get audio? 
 Hoo, hoo, you be too scared, you need to go home 
 Hoo, hoo, you be too scared, you need to go home 
 Hoo, hoo, you be too scared, you need to go home 
 Yeah, you need to go home, yeah, you need to go home 
 I am the champion 
 I am the champion 
 Lights, cameras, action 
 Whenever I play 
 I say, I am the champion 
 (I am the champion) 
 I am the champion 
 (I am the champion) 
 I say I am the champion 
 (I am the champion) 
 I am the champion 
 (I am the champion) 
 Whenever I, whenever I play, play 
 Whenever I, whenever I play, play
