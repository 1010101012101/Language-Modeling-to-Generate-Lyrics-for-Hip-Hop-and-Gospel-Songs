I'm in this apartment that I don't want no one to know 
 Dressed up for stages and faces in similar clothes 
 And always I'm venting and always inventing a song, ooh 
 And always ascending drifting into the unknown 
 I wonder if we are living a show so tell me I gotta know 
 If I were to be honest and bold would I be a hero 
 'Cause if you can see the colours that glow inside my soul 
 If were to bleed my blood would flow a violet Vibrato 
 La-la-la-la, la-la [x4] 
 Communication is so amazing when shown 
 As we awaken and all the pages unfold 
 From such a beautiful life [x2] 
 Ooh ooh 
 I wonder if we are living a show so tell me I gotta know 
 If I were to be honest and bold would I be a hero 
 'Cause if you can see the colours that glow inside my soul 
 If were to bleed my blood would flow a violet Vibrato 
 La-la-la-la, la-la [x4] 
 From such a beautiful life [x2] 
 I wonder if we are living a show so tell me I gotta know 
 If I were to be honest and bold would I be a hero 
 'Cause if you can see the colours that glow inside my soul 
 If were to bleed my blood would flow a violet Vibrato 
 La-la-la-la, la-la [x4]
