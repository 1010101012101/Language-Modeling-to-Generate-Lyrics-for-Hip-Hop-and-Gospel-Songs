Why do we all want all the things that we can't have at all 
 Eyes to the sky, but where do you look when the sky starts to fall 
 I look at my life, wondering how did I travel this far 
 Stuck in the sand, lost in the dessert, I'm trapped in the storm 
 In search of a shore lost in the dessert, I'm searching for more 
 In search of a shore trapped in the dessert, still searching for more 
 In search of a shore lost in the dessert, I'm trapped in the storm 
 I look at my life, wondering how did I travel this far 
 Maybe I'm blind by human desire, human design 
 Just a little bit further till I arrive 
 Or is it just a mirage fooling my mind 
 How foolish am I, how foolish am I 
 How foolish am I, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Why am I here in the same club with my back to the wall? 
 Speeding through life just to end up running back to the start 
 Backward and forward in every direction, disaster's in store 
 Like I'm stranded at sea, it feels like the end but I know that there's more 
 Still I'm searching for shore, stuck out at sea and I'm searching for more 
 In search of a shore, stranded at sea but I'm searching for more 
 In search of a shore, stuck out at sea and I'm trapped in a storm 
 I look at my life, wondering how did I travel this far 
 Maybe I'm blind by human desire, human design 
 Just a little bit further till I arrive 
 Or is it just a mirage fooling my mind 
 How foolish am I, how foolish am I 
 How foolish am I, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 Born under the view of the eye 
 The world can be ruthless, foolish and blind 
 Abracadabra, illusion and lies 
 Fed food to consume and influence the mind 
 Sacrificial executions disguised as 
 Shootings and crimes, the news televises 
 Who pulls the strings? Who has the dots? 
 Asking these questions I lose track of time 
 So I ask, how human am I? 
 Maybe I'm blind by human desire, human design 
 Just a little bit further till I arrive 
 Or is it just a mirage fooling my mind 
 How foolish am I, how foolish am I 
 How foolish am I, yeah, yeah, yeah
