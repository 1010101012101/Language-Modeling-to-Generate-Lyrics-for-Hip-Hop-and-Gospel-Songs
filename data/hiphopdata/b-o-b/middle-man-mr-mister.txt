(Middle Man) 
 Ernie, you a fool for this one 
 Nice than a motherfucker 
 Than a motherfucker 
 These days, niggas be polite than a motherfucker 
 Nice than a motherfucker 
 Smile in your face, I'm nice than a motherfucker 
 Soon as they thought I fell off, niggas' true colors shine bright than a motherfucker 
 Bright than a motherfucker 
 They hate me till they meet me, then they hype than a motherfucker 
 Hype than a motherfucker 
 That's cool, we was never cool anyway, huh, yeah 
 That's cool, we was never cool anyway 
 Ice cube on the pinkie and the middle finger 
 Lookin' like we won the Super Bowl anyway 
 Eeh, eeh, fuck what you sayin' to me? 
 You was just on my dick just 5 yesterdays 
 Backstabber on your resumé 
 Yee, yee, cappin' and you ain't even got your rent paid 
 I red the text, what that shit say? 
 I guess I got a short attention span 
 I learned it, get it straight from the source, fuck the middle man 
 Huh, oh, you hating? Don't be mad, don't be salty, don't be bitter, man 
 I learned it, get it straight from the source, fuck the middle man 
 Don't got a middle man, middle man 
 Nice than a motherfucker 
 Than a motherfucker 
 These days, niggas be polite than a motherfucker 
 Nice than a motherfucker 
 Smile in your face, I'm nice than a motherfucker 
 Soon as they thought I fell off, niggas' true colors shine bright than a motherfucker 
 Bright than a motherfucker 
 They hate me till they meet me, then they hype than a motherfucker 
 Hype than a motherfucker 
 That's cool, we was never cool anyway, huh, yeah 
 That's cool, we was never cool anyway 
 Ice cube on the pinkie and the middle finger 
 Lookin' like we won the Super Bowl anyway 
 Huh, look, DJ's say they support but they still phoney 
 They don't play my shit 'less I got Tip on it 
 They don't play your shit 'less there's a diss on it 
 Down to die for this shit, bet I live for it 
 For this moment 
 Had to vent so I hit up the big homie 
 Niggas don't even buy albums 
 But niggas still do anything for a deal, homie 
 Act like this shit don't apply to you, huh 
 Been in their game, look at how they do, huh 
 Why do yes man's start off ever sentence 
 With, "Dog, I wouldn't lie to you"? 
 Swag is so malleable, covered in valuables 
 I done accomplished, start what I set out to do 
 When we off the colors, not insurmountable 
 Bankroll unaccountable, down at the phantom blue 
 Bitches drinkin' Rosé like it's Mountain Dew 
 Guess what she's down to do, roll up a pound or two 
 Bruh, she already jiggin', ain't no turnin' back 
 I can no longer be held accountable 
 Why you make all that nigga music? 
 All you play is that nigga music 
 Call it what you want 
 But it ain't an anthem till the strippers moving 
 (But it ain't an anthem till the strippers moving) 
 I guess I got a short attention span 
 I learned it, get it straight from the source, fuck the middle man 
 Huh, oh, you hating? Don't be mad, don't be salty, don't be bitter, man 
 I learned it, get it straight from the source, fuck the middle man 
 Don't got a middle man, middle man
