Terry Urban. The Commissioner. One two. 
 Well I'm a wiz with my verbiage and speech 
 The only thing that I give is the words on this beats 
 And it's easy to see that I encourage the streets 
 So uh, a leader is what I must certainly be 
 Eastside 
 I'm in the game permanently 
 They say they calm but they really lookin' worried at me 
 Man I'ma be up in this bitch till they bury the B 
 The O the B and all the periods in between 
 Man I do this shit here for the city I'm from 
 And I'm 'bout to change what y'all consider the slums 
 Plus by thus far I'm as real as they come 
 So if you wanna stop me best pick up a gun 
 Bust something 
 Well all that I've have got to give 
 Is these words I say 
 And when the timin' is right 
 I promise you, you'll understand one day 
 How how how how how how how how how 
 Oh one day 
 How how how how how how how how how 
 One me, one day 
 So all that I have got to give 
 Is these words I say 
 And when the timin' is right 
 I promise you, you'll understand one day 
 How how how how how how how how how 
 Oh one day 
 How how how how how how how how how 
 One day 
 Haha, pleeeeease don't hate 
 You know I'm nice 
 Comin' through your screen like I'm Poltergeist 
 The flow is somethin' like snow in October right? 
 So when I hold the mic bitch, I'm Dolomite 
 Huh, but y'all doin' nothin' 
 Me? I'm up in the sky, I'm abductin' 
 Y'all Earthlings with my super duper button 
 I got a space ray, fuck what y'all bustin' 
 But man, I'm really just advanced 
 I'm not a human, I got antennas that are hands 
 And I got government transmitters in my head 
 So I'm paranoid I got bullets in my bed 
 Right next to the fullies, so I'm fully gettin' dressed 
 In the mornin' with girlfriend, busy cookin' breakfast 
 Well all that I've have got to give 
 Is these words I say 
 And when the timin' is right 
 I promise you, you'll understand one day 
 How how how how how how how how how 
 Oh one day 
 How how how how how how how how how 
 One me, one day 
 So all that I have got to give 
 Is these words I say 
 And when the timin' is right 
 I promise you, you'll understand one day 
 How how how how how how how how how 
 Oh one day 
 How how how how how how how how how 
 One day
