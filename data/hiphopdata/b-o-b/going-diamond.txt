Nelly Frutado Promiscuous Girl Part: 
 Peace- 
 But naw I ain't gone Hollywood 
 I'm still in the hood and I blow a lot of good 
 Yo And when I'm out I don't wanna have my buds 
 My buddy in stood and da best best buds 
 Gotta get a kush just to roll it up 
 So If you in the need baby come on take a puff 
 Come and stay with us if you wanna make a fuss 
 In the middle of the night tell ya boyfriend hush (DAMN) 
 But oh don't take it personal 
 You so bad when you move and earth my soul 
 And this nigga wanna hop on this purp cologne 
 Hold this girl on this thing it'll hurt ya bowl 
 Oh yes yes I'm a beast and now I hunt ya sleep but really honestly 
 I'm like a mup at lunch ya see (HEY) 
 In my brain in the game like I'm munching people
