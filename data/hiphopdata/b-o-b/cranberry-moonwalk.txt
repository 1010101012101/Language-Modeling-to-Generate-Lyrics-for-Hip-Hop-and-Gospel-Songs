If we gon' smoke, gotta do it out a jar 
 If we gon' ride, gotta drop the top on the car 
 I pull over to the side, you don't mind if I play my guitar 
 We're just starin' at the stars tryna figure out who we are 
 Oh cranberry moonwalk 
 Cranberry moonwalk

 Paid for tuition, that's a graduation 
 Killin' through the presidents, that's assassination 
 Uh I smoke a half, I make her 
 Bang that bitch and her baby make up 
 Look, I ain't no baby maker 
 She was hanging so tight I had to amputate her like uh

 Ball up, pour up, twist a few 
 But hey I've been runnin' this shit so long 
 Imma fuck around and blow out a hit or two

 And I swear this freak bitch ride my wave so long 
 She know how to surf now 
 If we gon' smoke, gotta do it out a jar 
 If we gon' ride, gotta drop the top on the car 
 I pull over to the side, you don't mind if I play my guitar 
 We're just starin' at the stars tryna figure out who we are 
 Oh cranberry moonwalk

 Yes, I've done it, I've done it, I've done it, I've done it 
 And they think that they do but don't want it, don't want it, don't want it, don't want it 
 If we gon' smoke, gotta do it out a jar 
 If we gon' ride, gotta drop the top on the car 
 I pull over to the side, you don't mind if I play my guitar 
 We're just starin' at the stars tryna figure out who we are 
 Oh cranberry moonwalk
