You wanna pop bottles until you're on the floor 
 Hang with all the models and all the centerfolds 
 Showin' off her body, now watch her strike a pose 
 Tryin' to get beside me so she can get a hold 
 Of them ole Bobby Ray Bands 
 She want them Ray Bands, she want them Ray Bands 
 Bobby Ray Bands 
 She want them Ray Bands, she want them Ray Bands 
 She want them Ray Bands, Bobby Ray Bands 
 She wants them Ray Bands cause them bands are gorgeous 
 She looking for a sponsor and I ain't talking corporate 
 She after that endorsement 
 Ever since she saw me on the Forbes list 
 She be getting zero's from heroes 
 They're Zorros with horses 
 My Mustangs and Porsches imported from Japan 
 She from Atlanta but she on that college strand 
 That's that overseas money, call 'em Taliban 
 She WMD, aw yes spring to winter 
 So pencil her in for breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner 
 Ain't no incidentals 
 She want them bands like a freelance parade (All day) 
 Compliments of Bobby Ray

 Look, she want them Ray Bands, them Ray Bands, that coin 
 Gourmet top-house sirloin, courtesy of ya boy 
 She she she she think I owe her, Des Moines 
 Quite being annoying, do something useful and roll a joint 
 You see business over bullshit's my company policy 
 And my team's going green and I ain't talking 'bout pottery 
 You tryin' to hit the party, she tryin' to hit the lottery 
 And if they watchin' girl, your grandfather clockin' it 
 I don't pop bottles, I got pop dollars 
 After Strange Clouds, I'ma drop my rock album 
 Violent bravado, call me Bobby Bravo 
 Every play is crucial, yeah that's my motto 
 Said wassup, yeah we do this all the time 
 Where the real freaks who wanna have a good night? 
 If ya feel that, let it go it's all right 
 The music got you movin' and you're losin' your mind 
 So let me know if it's all right 
 I just wanna know, shawty, have a good time 
 So why don't you let go, let go 
 You're losing control 
 The music got you movin' and you're losing your mind 
 You wanna pop bottles until you're on the floor 
 Hang with all the models and all the centerfolds 
 Showin' off her body, now watch her strike a pose 
 Tryin' to get beside me so she can get a hold
