But she the type of girl drive the whole hood crazy 
 Little Red Riding Hood riding M80's 
 The type of girl that will probly be famous 
 Hollywood superstar, magazine pages 
 Apparently she had a thing for a nigga 
 Unfortunately the nigga wasn't me 
 Nowadays she's the life of the party 
 Glamorous and glossy, taking all those in the VIP 
 Now I'm like damn, wow 
 Look at you now 
 You got the whole world chasing you down 
 This man re-met her now now 
 Y'all dressed in black black black 
 With a rude attitude tude tude 
 And tattoos down your back back back 
 But still you run circles through my head (circles through my head) 
 Circles through my head (circles through my head) 
 These she goes again (These she goes again) 
 And there she goes again (These she goes again) 
 I just wanna get to know ya 
 But you turn the other shoulder 
 And there she goes again (These she goes again) 
 Running circles through my head (circles through my head) 
 Burning circles through membrane 
 Top the beat, shift gears, switch lanes on it 
 I haven't seen ya in a minute but the hands of time show me it's some good thangs for ya 
 Like a A list stylerity, ain't gotta see ID 
 Cause nowadays she's the life of the party 
 Glamorous and glossy, taking all those in the VIP 
 Now I'm like damn, wow
