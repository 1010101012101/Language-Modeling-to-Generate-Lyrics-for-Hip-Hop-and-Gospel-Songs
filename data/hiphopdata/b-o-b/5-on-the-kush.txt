 5 on the Kush 
 20 on the Drinks 
 So floated in the club n*ggas can't think x5 
 (B.o.B:) 
 Yeah, Yeah, HaHa 
 I say I throw to the side 
 Like a lateral 
 I swear tonight I'm doing major damage 
 Is collateral 
 50 on the potion 
 100 on the smoking 
 Panoramic roof 
 But we ride in slow motion 
 Patron pass to ya 
 Top self we toasted 
 Top models 
 Tops poppin' off Kelly Rowland 
 Its whatever I never let up 
 I never feel better 
 A house for the freaks 
 And ill never say never 
 My seats all leather 
 My jackets all leather 
 Got peter pissed off cause my pillow full of feathers 
 Since day one I stay down like a celler 
 Bun B, KRIT BoB we some Fuckin' trend setters

 Ok I roll up to the club 
 I pull up to the mother fuckin' top 
 Got some hoes with a whippin bit on top 
 Woofers in my cushion ... 
 DJ on the dash 
 If I want it then I cop 
 Its G a ho x2 
 And she a ho 
 A sheep n*gga leave alone 
 What you pop pills for 
 So high in the sky we crakin windows 
 And this the end tho
