 (Verse 1: B.o.B) 
 Number 1 on your playlist, one of Atlanta's bravest 
 They wondering how I deal with the fame 
 I villainified, this gravy 
 Shout out to all the ladies 
 I don't know why I have to say this but 
 I'm into deep sea diving 
 I go deeper than the Navy 
 Behavin' like I'm mavin' 
 I'm crazy crazy crazy 
 I rise to the occupation 'cause raging's my occupation 
 Shouts out to my Haitians my Asians and my Caucasians, Latina 
 Senorita es muy caliente 
 They say I'm amazing but 
 Really it's amazing 
 Todays world the craziest 
 To make the main page 
 Just to be a daily topic of a conversation 
 Kutta's on the beat so I guess it's an operation 
 So call me Dr. Bob yes I'm on the job 
 She say I'm like a teacher before she lights my yard 
 Stick to the script take a shit in your draws 
 And I don't need to take you number girl this ain't no casting call 
 (Verse 2: B.o.B) 
 Yes she give it to me 'cause she know just how I want it 
 And if this where we battle we would be worthy opponents 
 I had to get up on it 
 Kinda how you do a pony 
 It's kinda like a bank 
 'Cause she knows she wants to loan it 
 Shout out to my gangsta 
 Who get down in Atlanta 
 Wassup to Magic City 
 This here should be your weather 
 So throw it on back 'cause I want that butt 
 I'm a still be hear when the sun comes up 
 When the sun comes up who'll still be here 
 With ball and a bat give me one more plaque 
 So I guess I might as well turn things up 
 I'm a burn things up like the purp you puff 
 Tryna get loose she poppin' that coo 
 But when she get through she goin' serve things up 
 All the bad girls in the building just shake it 
 One time if ya feel it now, 
 I ain't really trippin' bout yo homegirls with ya 
 I'm a bring you home with em 
 And she goin' get it 
 Lay up obe I don't really want no more 
 But I'm a just go fast like a baseball throw 
 Fast like a kenco show now I'm in the zone I ain't even playin' 
 In the paint no mo' I'm a take it straight to the hole 
 Hell yeah she know she bad 
 She so bad
