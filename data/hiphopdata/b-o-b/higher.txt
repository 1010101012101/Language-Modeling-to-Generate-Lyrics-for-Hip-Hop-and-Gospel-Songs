[Verse One] [B.O.B]: 
 You may not know my name 
 But by the time I leave you 
 Remember the B. to the O. to the B. 
 And every single dot that's in between 
 And every time I hop up in the scene 
 I'm feeling like I'm better than befo 
 I'm ready for whatever 
 If you feel me let me know 
 'Cause I just wanna flow 
 I got up in this game tryin' to prove that I'm better than befo 
 But I don't even sweat it anymore 
 I get up in the zone as I coast 
 As I take flight 
 Gravity better hold me tight 
 Your relativity don't mold me right 
 On every single kick every snare every line 
 Please don't compare niggas to me 'cause I'm Ham on the mic 
 I'm down for the gamble like a red pair of dice 
 You scared of the fight 
 When you lay down and prepare for the night 
 I'll be in the air on a flight 
 I don't even care what the time 
 High in the days of my mind 
 Every single face that I eye says "Hey Bobby Ray" I say, "Hi" 
 "You livin' the craziest life." 
 In a pair of shades I'ma bathe in the spotlight rays 
 Making every nightclub jump like raves 
 Braves, braves 
 Home of the Braves 
 East side Atlanta that's where I stay 
 Yeah 
 I'll take you higher 
 Higher than you've ever been 
 See things you never thought, you thought would never exist 
 Higher 
 Higher than you've ever been 
 Where we go we won't fall, we'll stay there 
 Cause there's a place 
 No walls 
 It's been ages 
 Since we've gone 
 Get away 
 So long 
 Levitate 
 Higher than you've ever been 
 [Verse Two] [Playboy Tre]: 
 Yeah 
 What am I to tell you 
 Streets never gave a drunk number 
 A double shot of Hen, couple friends and a pen 
 Do a couple years, come home, a year later, nigga locked up again 
 Man, calls on the phone 
 Nigga what the biz? 
 God damn y'all doin' y'all thang 
 If life is a game 
 Tre, play that shit before your folks come home with the ring 
 Champ, do it for the hood, do it for the camp 
 Passport livin', nigga do it for the stamps 
 Do it for the date till there ain't none left 
 Beat a bitch back like a trunk full of amps 
 Trunk full of amps? 
 Trunk full of amps 
 Posted up drunk on the streets like lamps 
 Everybody high, better word to the wise 
 Don't try my clique 'cause they might get amped 
 So this for my niggas locked up who call 
 Say they want beats instead of shows on the wall 
 Know every time that I hit that stage I don't do it for myself 
 Man I do it for us all 
 This is for my niggas who locked up who write 
 Say through you, I try to live my life 
 Fuck what they say, nigga get your pay 
 They wanna go high so I take flight 
 Yeah 
 I'll take you higher 
 Higher than you've ever been 
 See things you never thought, you thought would never exist 
 Higher

 Where we go we won't fall, we'll stay there 
 Cause there's a place 
 No walls 
 It's been ages 
 Since we've gone 
 Get away 
 So long

 [Verse Three] [Cyhi Da Prynce]: 
 Okay yeah 
 Higher than you've ever been 
 Just when you won't find a better medicine 
 I would highly recommend that you smoking in the suite 
 Ask when I got it and I say "I met a friend" 
 Police at the do', I would never let them in 
 Everyday I wake up and I try to set a trend 
 Thomas Edison will 
 Now I'm in a country that you've never been 
 Huh 
 Netherlands 
 Doin' more interviews than David Letterman 
 I don't know too many niggas better than 
 Prynce CyHi, so who wanna bet a Benz? 
 Vanilla, or yellow skin 
 Big booty bitch, call her Evelyn 
 Haters turn me in when it comes to green 
 Get your dog shot like a veterinarian 
 Ha 
 Tool on the seat 
 Fly young nigga, keep it cool in the heat 
 Calmer than a farmer 'cause I'm used to the beef 
 Got more soul/sole than the shoes on your feet 
 Still a nigga freak then I move it to the east 
 She's probably yo girl if she's cute and petite 
 She said she's got a man, what you doin' with a geek? 
 Fuck him baby, come cool with the heat 
 Yeah 
 I'll take you higher 
 Higher than you've ever been 
 See things you never thought, you thought would never exist

 [Verse Four] [Bun B]: 
 Feelin' so dandy 
 Comin' out candy 
 Creepin' on grain in a clean 'Lac 
 Go jump in the slab 
 Put your seat belt on then adjust your position and lean back 
 Guess who 
 Bun B and B.o.B and we be all about those green backs 
 And we ain't farin' no mean mugs with no lean thugs and we mean that 
 Represent, Lone Star State and Crush City 
 Home of the Astros 
 With them boys on the cush, smokin' on kush in a cigar straight from Castro 
 We in the kitchen bakin' on them pies 
 Gettin' that doe without havin' to pass "Go" 
 And if you in the way of me and Bob gettin' this paper who gon' let your ass know 
 That we the chosen 
 While you in time frozen 
 We go straight ahead 
 Sayin' he ain't this and he ain't that and he can't rap, but maine fuck what a hater said 
 I keep on rollin' like a bald tire 
 With a bad broad that'll pull fire 
 Underground King due to my empire 
 They might be high but I'ma take them higher

 Higher than you've ever been 
 See things you never thought, you thought would never exist 
 Higher
