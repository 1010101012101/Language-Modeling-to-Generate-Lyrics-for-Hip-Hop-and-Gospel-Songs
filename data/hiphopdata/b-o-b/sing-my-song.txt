My name is Bob 
 And I don't have a job 
 I don't know why I say these things 
 But it's the reason why I sing my song 
 It's why I sing my song 
 I don't know why I say these things 
 But it's the reason why I sing my song 
 It's why I sing my song 
 I don't know why I say these things 
 But it's the reason why I sing my song 
 Catch me cruisin through Decatur with my streetwalkers 
 Spittin', pimpin' at these women, ain't a sweet talker 
 A young country boy, came up out the creekwater 
 What a grizzly boy, lookin' like a beast on it 
 Now I don't like the law, so fuck the police department 
 Pullin me over, and I don't even be speedin on em 
 Well I think it's 'cause they don't like me, well me so sorry 
 'Cause I got all the caucasians saying that he's so bossy 
 Well long story short, this is me and I'm bossy 
 If I wasn't smokin' weed, then I'd be drinking coffee 
 Well pour this in my cup, just to show I give a fuck bout what y'all be thinkin' need what I'm sayin', gone and zip it up 
 I don't even know why I'm in this goddamn booth 
 But it's the reason why I sing my song 
 It's why I sing my song 
 I don't know why I say these things 
 But it's the reason why I sing my song 
 It's why I sing my song 
 I don't know why I say these things 
 But it's the reason why I sing my song 
 If you ain't noticed I don't really give a damn 
 This life's too hard to follow rules and be takin' exams 
 So I decided to do music just to make some fans 
 So while I got the mic I want to say fuck Uncle Sam 
 I just think of crazy shit and try to make it jam 
 So when I'm tired of rappin' I sing the best I can 
 Simpy 'cause I ain't got nothin' better to do with time 
 I'd rather producin rhymes than slangin and shootin dimes 
 I ain't really got nothin' else to say but I'll finish it 
 Just to show y'all how y'all can benefit if I'm generous 
 I'll just write a verse, sit back and collect percentages 
 It's 4 o'clock and I don't even think I'm finished yet 
 But it's the reason why I sing my song 
 It's why I sing my song 
 I don't know why I say these things 
 But it's the reason why I sing my song 
 It's why I sing my song 
 I don't know why I say these things 
 But it's the reason why I sing my song 
 It's why I sing my song 
 It's why I sing my song 
 It's why I sing my song 
 My song 
 My song 
 My song
