You would rather be far away, just to have it go all your way 
 But can you afford the cost to pay 
 Your living in a dangerous wonderland x5 
 Well welcome to the wonder 
 The land of make believe 
 That make you believe your safe 
 Because this is the place to be 
 You feel all right as long as the famine and war stays overseas 
 And anyone over the border 
 You look at like the opposing team 
 Is this what it's sposed to be 
 Or am I just talkin' emotionally 
 What if I expose my beliefs 
 That I hold real close to me 
 Would you call me crazy and put my face all over ya magamazines 
 Tell me 
 Do you actually think I'm as the same as I'ma have you see 
 You would rather be far away, just to have it go all your way 
 But can you afford the cost to pay 
 Your living in a dangerous wonderland x5 
 When I say the masses 
 Millions of kids in classes 
 One of them got kept backwards 
 For failure to do what they asked em 
 They will say he was stubborn and acted 
 Like he wasn't the son of a pastor 
 So he got him a pen and pad then 
 Started rappin' and singin' and clappin 
 Just to make the days go by faster 
 And one day he decided he had it 
 And he left and he never look back at 
 All the relative mathematics 
 So he took the lies and detracted them 
 And divided them like a fraction 
 And he opened his eyes and realized 
 That he tapped into the galactic 
 Off he blasted 
 You would rather be far away, just to have it go all your way 
 But can you afford the cost to pay 
 Your living in a dangerous wonderland x5 
 You would rather be far away, just to have it go all your way 
 But can you afford the cost to pay 
 Your living in a dangerous wonderland x5 
 Wonderland x16 
 You would rather be far away, just to have it go all your way 
 But can you afford the cost to pay 
 Your living in a dangerous wonderland
