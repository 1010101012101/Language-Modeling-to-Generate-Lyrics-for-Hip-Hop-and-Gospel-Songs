(Verse 1: B.o.B) 
 Well me and her were the 2 
 Me and her were together like glue 
 But we lived packed in a shack 
 Like the old lady who lived in a shoe 
 And we ain't really know what to do 
 Till one day she got her a job at WaMu 
 I said baby if you been thinkin' what I thinkin', then all of our problems are through 
 So we got together with the crew 
 And planned everything with the T 
 We got gloves and guns and bags and masks 
 And anything we would need 
 So we scoped out the facility 
 Really waited a couple of weeks. 
 Till it was time to kick in the door 
 Everyone down it's a robbery 
 You're as cold as ice (you're as cold as ice) 
 You're willing to sacrifice our love 
 And now you got me (Froze) 
 I said you got me (froze) 
 Because you're so c-cold 
 You left me cold tonight 
 (Verse 2: B.o.B) 
 So I went to my girl and said "quit playin' and give me the cash" 
 But nobody suspected a thing 
 It was quite a spectacular act 
 So we get to the safe out of everyone's sight 
 So I take off my mask and ask 
 "Did your partner remember to cut the line for the panic button in the back? " 
 And she paused 
 The look she had on her face was cold as ice 
 Before she could she could say the next word I heard the sirens pull out outside 
 So I tried to grab her and run, she pulled away and said she would be fine 
 She was on the clock so I guess nobody would think she was in on the crime 
 You're as cold as ice (you're as cold as ice) 
 You're willing to sacrifice our love 
 And now you got me (Froze) 
 I said you got me (froze) 
 Because you're so c-cold 
 You left me cold tonight 
 (Verse 3: B.o.B) 
 So I realized it was over 
 When the SWAT team kicked in the door 
 So I dropped my gun and the cash, and then I got bummed rushed to the floor 
 And they took me into the station 
 And they started the interrogation 
 And I said, "I ain't sayin' a word till I get appropriate representation" 
 So as I get escorted out, to my surprise what do I see 
 That's my baby sittin' in cuffs 
 Tellin' the officers everything 
 Ans I stand there in amazement 
 Trying to find an explanation 
 And the cops come in and restrain me 
 And they mase me and the taze me 
 I said, "baby why baby what did I do to forsake you 
 How can you turn your back on me you're selfish I hate you 
 All I ever wanted to do love you 
 Were you fakin'? " 
 So I snatched the gun from my officer 
 And I cocked it and I aimed it 
 And said, "this is for all the pain you done put me through you're ungrateful how could you 
 All I wanted to do was save you" 
 And here I am day 55 
 With 55 hundred to go 
 When you love a girl who is as cold as ice 
 Eventually you'll get froze 
 You're as cold as ice (you're as cold as ice) 
 You're willing to sacrifice our love 
 And now you got me (Froze) 
 I said you got me (froze) 
 Because you're so c-cold 
 You left me cold tonight 
 32 degrees below zero 
 You're like 31 flavors you're oh so cold 
 Feels like 30 straight days of falling snow 
 I'm so cold and alone, alone 
 You're like 32 degrees below zero 
 Or like 31 flavors you're oh so cold 
 Feels like 30 straight days of falling snow 
 I'm so cold and alone, alone 
 You left me cold tonight 
 You're as cold as ice (you're as cold as ice) 
 You're willing to sacrifice our love 
 And now you got me (Froze) 
 I said you got me (froze) 
 Because you're so c-cold 
 You left me cold tonight
