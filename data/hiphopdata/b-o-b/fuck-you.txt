They say that I'm changing 
 'Cause I'm gettin' famous 
 Fuck I don't need nobody but my god damn self 
 I don't need nobody but my god damn self 
 They say that I'm changing 
 'Cause I'm gettin' famous 
 Fuck I don't need nobody but my god damn self 
 I don't need nobody but my god damn self 
 Since I been in dis game 
 It's been like a ceilin fan 
 What comes around goes around 
 Will circlen back again 
 Your friends start enemies 
 Then enemies fall in your face 
 And then try ta emphentray 
 This all 'cause I entertain 
 But still it's quite entertainin 
 To see all these niggas faces 
 They call me B.o.B now 
 But back then I could'nt make it 
 They say that I came up and I failed outa class 
 But it worked out both ways 
 'Cause they ain't gotta see my black ass 
 So I grew up in dakota set 
 Where the coc 'n' dro is at 
 Stayin strapped 'n' loaded man 
 That's all they spose to know about 
 That's why I stay paranoid 
 Cause these niggas hatin' now 
 So I keep my middle finger up until I made it out 
 They say that I'm changing 
 'Cause I'm gettin' famous 
 Fuck I don't need nobody but my god damn self 
 I don't need nobody but my god damn self 
 They say that I'm changing 
 'Cause I'm gettin' famous 
 Fuck I don't need nobody but my god damn self 
 I don't need nobody but my god damn self 
 Now yestaday, me 'n' my dawg got loaded 
 Cracked a joke on my dawg, my dawg exploded 
 Nigga you changing, boy you meant that 
 Where da love had went at 
 Can't stand to see a nigga shinin 
 Now you under-eye-in 
 The click 
 Hate to see a nigga smile 'n' laugh 
 Fuck you 
 Hate to see me signing autographs 
 Fuck you 
 All I need, is my voice since I'm fire weed 
 I don't owe a nigga shit 
 And I'll ask for you to ride my dick 
 How am I gon' change, all I know is da streets 
 There's alota guttas on my street and alot of gutta in me 
 Don't speak at me, don't wave 
 Ain't no hip hop parade 
 By the way, suck a dick, you got some garbage ass waves 
 They say that I'm changing 
 'Cause I'm gettin' famous 
 Fuck I don't need nobody but my god damn self 
 I don't need nobody but my god damn self 
 They say that I'm changing 
 'Cause I'm gettin' famous 
 Fuck I don't need nobody but my god damn self 
 I don't need nobody but my god damn self 
 Let me speak up so eryone can here me 
 You ain't neva had nuttin, so you all should fear me 
 Young, wild, n ruthless 
 Consider me grown 
 Ery man for himself in tha each zone 
 And ery since I made a statement 
 Ya bouncas could'nttake it 
 Dats a shame, look at how they obligatin 
 Hatin' steadily plottin 'n' wishin for Lil DG's position 
 They juss blinded by the lights 
 Ain't payin' attention 
 Know how ta struggle with tha hard, tha green, n tha soft 
 Know how ta lear ta pay the cost to be the boss 
 You got people that follow people, screamin they need help 
 But I don't need nobody but my god damn self 
 They say that I'm changing 
 'Cause I'm gettin' famous 
 Fuck you 
 Fuck you
