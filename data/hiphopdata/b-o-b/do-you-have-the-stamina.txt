(Intro: sample from Kanye West's "Pinocchio Story") 
 "Do you really have the stamina? 
 For everybody that sees you that say, 'Where's my camera?' 
 For everybody that sees you, and say, 'Sign an autograph' 
 For everybody that sees you cry, and say, 'You oughta laugh' 
 You oughta laugh!" 
 [Chorus: Kanye West sample] + (B.o.B) 
 "Do you really have the stamina?" 
 (Do you have the stamina) 
 "For everybody that sees you that say, "Where's my camera?'" 
 (Where's my camera) 
 "For everybody that sees you, to say, "Sign an autograph" 
 (Sign an autograph) 
 "For everybody that sees you cry, and say, "You oughta laugh" 
 (Say you oughta laugh) "You oughta laugh!" 
 [Verse One]: 
 Well, posing for pictures and living on a poster 
 The hardest thing for me is to keep my composure 
 I ain't always happy, and I ain't always sad 
 But when the spotlight is on, you have to handle the task 
 And even the people that swear they love so bad 
 Will go and put your dirty laundry on the cover of mags 
 And then everyone sees it and gets a good laugh 
 And now, your whole persona is just a thing of the past 
 Now, when people see they ignore all the pain 
 They only think about the rumors and the mistakes you made 
 So that's why I don't read all the comments on the blogs 
 Everybody's a fan if you boo me or applaud 
 Now give me your energy, even if you're my enemy 
 Or trying to be friends with me, aggressively or timidly 
 Put my next to anyone in this industry 
 You still will never find someone that's in my league 
 [Chorus: Kanye West sample] + (B.o.B) 
 "Do you really have the stamina?" 
 (Do you have the stamina) 
 "For everybody that sees you that say, "Where's my camera?'" 
 (Where's my camera) 
 "For everybody that sees you, to say, "Sign an autograph" 
 (Sign an autograph) 
 "For everybody that sees you cry, and say, "You oughta laugh" 
 (Say you oughta laugh) "You oughta laugh!" 
 [Verse Two]: 
 Celebrity this, celebrity that 
 Reality television fiends addicted like crack and smack 
 My business is rap, and my business is politicking with dat 
 And then my business is put on the map 
 Yeah, the bigger I get, the better the hat 
 The better the slacks, the better the shirts, the more I adapt 
 The more you start to pay attention to my sentences 
 The more you'll realize why I am lyricist 
 And why I sacrifice my time for this experience 
 And why my album still isn't in your speakers yet 
 You think you know me now, but you ain't even seen me yet 
 Well, except maybe on your TV set 
 Bring the bridge 
 (35 second Instrumental Break) 
 {*Scratched: "Bring the bridge"*} 
 [Chorus: Kanye West sample] + (B.o.B) 
 "Do you really have the stamina?" 
 (Do you have the stamina) 
 "For everybody that sees you that say, "Where's my camera?'" 
 (Where's my camera) 
 "For everybody that sees you, to say, "Sign an autograph" 
 (Sign an autograph) 
 "For everybody that sees you cry, and say, "You oughta laugh" 
 (Say you oughta laugh) "You oughta laugh!"
