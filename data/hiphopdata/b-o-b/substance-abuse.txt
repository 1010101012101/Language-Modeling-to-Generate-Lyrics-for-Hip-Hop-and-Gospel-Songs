 Abusin' from sick, high choosin' 
 Nigga, God bless you, I'm a God, bless you 
 Four projects in, what you thought I was gon' do? 
 Smoke any less weed, pop any less shrooms? 
 Bob, Bob, Bob, this is your mind, okay 
 This is your mind on drugs 
 You have any idea what this means? 
 It means I'm high as fuck 
 They describe teens all type of stuff 
 Should have calmed me down, should have hyped you up 
 Even the side effects got side effects 
 As if you ain't already depressed enough 
 So what is abuse to smoke out, I need its use 
 Not even for pharmacy use 
 You just say no, I say let's roll up a doob 
 And turn up a pot of soup 
 Off of who? Off of like formula food 
 Or hormones that farmers produce? 
 I come with the truth, I like in the now with no roof 
 Don't know what a doctor would do 
 When people get high, I just get high off this weed 
 Don't need no alternative route 
 I'm stuck on the moon, don't fit in, bet I'm in the loop 
 And no, there ain't no substitutes 
 This substance abuse, abuse, yeah, abuse, what 
 Substance abuse, abuse, look, abuse, what 
 Substance abuse, abuse, abuse

 Talkin' 'bout weed and alcohol, weed and alcohol 
 Yeah, some stories too true to tell 
 And some made up 'cause these days good music don't always mean music sells 
 You either star in a TV show, sell dope 
 Scams, swiper have shoes to sell 
 Huh, it's all about the headlines 
 All about the rumors and the groupie tells 
 Life is a choice and I choose 'em well 
 Might as well jump a coupe off the motherfuckin' roof 
 And parachute in a suit, 100 bitches below 
 200 titties salute, salute, salute, huh (substance) 
 So what is abuse? This shit ain't prescribed to the youth 
 Was on 'til several law suits 
 How they'd get approved and then from the shelves it's removed? 
 A new one gets reintroduced 
 Who's makin' the rules? 
 The war that's on drugs did to weed what proambition did to booze 
 But weed doesn't kill 
 Can't say the same if you drunk and decide you gon' go for a cruise 
 The war that's on drugs actually creates all the violence 
 And problems we see on the news 
 I'm callin' a truce, they been usin' all kind of nukes 
 But the public's no longer confused 
 This substance abuse, abuse, yeah, abuse, what 
 Substance abuse, abuse, look, abuse, what 
 Substance abuse, abuse, abuse 
 Talkin' 'bout weed and alcohol, weed and alcohol 
 Substance abuse, abuse, yeah, abuse, what 
 Substance abuse, abuse, look, abuse, what 
 Substance abuse, abuse, abuse 
 Talkin' 'bout weed and alcohol, weed and alcohol
