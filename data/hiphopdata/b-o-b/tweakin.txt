(London Jae:) 
 I be spazzin', spazzin', spazzin' 
 I be tweakin', tweakin', tweakin' 
 I be stuntin', stuntin', stuntin' 
 I be geekin', geekin', geekin' 
 Spazz, tweak, stunt, geek 
 I be spazzin', spazzin', spazzin' 
 I be tweakin', tweakin', tweakin' 
 I be stuntin', stuntin', stuntin' 
 I be geekin', geekin', geekin' 
 Spazz, tweak, stunt, geek

 I be spazzin' (Spell that shit) 
 S - P - A - Z - Z - I - N 
 I be dabbin' (Spell that shit) 
 D - A - B - B - I - N 
 Hold up, bae, roll up, bae 
 'Bout to pour a four up, bae 
 I just got some head from shawty, I'ont even know her yet 
 Real strong, real grown, your boy ain't spazzin on me, real feel homie 
 This fresh, rockin' pole everything to the neck, got five karats all in the grill homie 
 Car foreign, y'all boring, got TVS all in the whip watchin' hard porn 
 Rifle cocked.40 Glock, I'm tweak, tweak, tweak tweakin' 
 Boy stop, girl gone, get my syrup on 
 Pu the word on the curb homie 
 All my niggas got furs on 
 Geeked up in the club last night, everything was a blur homie 
 Benz blue, Jimmy Choo, in the booty club, find me a girl to get tanned to 
 This Cartier lens blue, I got a pocket full of dead white men, we friends too

 (B.o.B.:) 
 I ain't got the illuminati money, but I got the boy you shouldn't try me money 
 Wonder why they haven't heard an album from me 
 Didn't sell my soul, they tried to buy it from me 
 Ha ha not for sale, ain't a fan of fairy tales 
 Ain't no air of oxygen, in outer space, tell me how the hell to fuel a rocket ship 
 Now how does it throttle 
 The truth is a hard pill to swallow 
 Landing footage from Apollo look like amateur night down at the Apollo and they say in space 
 It's four thousand degrees, but it's only seven elements available that can withstand that much heat 
 Look, now all these niggas political now 
 Claimin' they woke 'cause it's trendier now 
 Overnight activist, even the president's running the world from a twitter account 
 Ah, geekin' often, Steven hawkins, 'bout my coin like meter parking 
 Off the wall like Peter Parker 
 Here let's get to squeezing on you like some squeegee water 
 Keep the garter bitch 
 Bandz
