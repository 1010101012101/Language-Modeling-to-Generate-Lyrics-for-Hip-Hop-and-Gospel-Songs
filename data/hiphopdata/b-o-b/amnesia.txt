Now I'm gonna go to the place where I know I've been free. 
 If you just gave me one more chance I might have gotten rid of amnesia. 
 Yeah you know. 
 Next time leave when you can instead of just staring at me like that that 
 I don't need this epic bull, I know what I want in life. 
 If you get sick no need for amnesia. 
 K... kkkk... Kay! 
 Leave me like this even though you know it's wrong. 
 I know it and you leave it 'cause you don't care what I have. 
 What I think is you and me never came together.
