[Chorus] (B.O.B) 
 Well, I'm a make a lot of money 
 (Make a lot of money) 
 And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this 
 (Quit this) 
 Crazy scene 
 (B.O.B) 
 Well I'm a quit this crazy scene 
 Cause being famous ain't all what they make it to be 
 But back then y'all this was my favorite dream 
 But now, I wouldn't hesitate I would leave 
 'Cause I'ma 
 [Chorus] (B.O.B) 
 Make a lot of money 
 (Make a lot of money) 
 And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this 
 (Quit this) 
 Crazy scene 
 (Asher Roth) 
 I'm a quit this crazy scene 
 Cause everything you see ain't really how it be 
 Please don't believe in that TV screen 
 I'm sorry kids but there's no such thing 
 I'm gonna 
 Make a lot of money 
 And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this 
 Crazy scene 
 (B.O.B) 
 Well I'm gonna quit this crazy scene 
 It's funny 
 Cause this is what I waited to be 
 Bein' on stage was amazin' to me 
 But now I'm in the game, it ain't the way that it seems 
 I'ma 
 [Chorus] (B.O.B) 
 Make a lot of money 
 (Make a lot of money) 
 And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this 
 (Quit this) 
 Crazy scene 
 (Asher Roth) 
 And I don't know how to feel 
 When this 
 Dream of mine used to be so real 
 I would anything just to sign a deal 
 But now I trade it all for a home cooked meal 
 I wanna 
 [Chorus] (Asher) 
 Make a lot of money 
 And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this 
 (Then I'm gonna quit this, quit this) 
 Crazy scene 
 (B.O.B) 
 Oh, what? 
 You say it could be worse? 
 Well step in my shoes, put yourself in my shirt 
 I'm only human y'all so we all gotta work 
 But sometimes I wonder why I even came to this earth 
 I'ma 
 [Chorus] (B.O.B) 
 Make a lot of money 
 (Make a lot of money) 
 And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this 
 (Quit this) 
 Crazy scene 
 (Asher) 
 Look 
 'Cause they don't care about us 
 They just use us up 
 Leave us in the dust 
 And it roughs me up 
 So much I could cuss 
 But 
 Enough's enough 
 I want out of these cuffs 
 I'm gonna 
 Make a lot of money 
 And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this 
 Crazy scene 
 (B.O.B) 
 Sometimes I just feel hopeless 
 Pacin' back and forth, man I can't even focus 
 So I'm always smokin' in the booth recordin' 
 Cause my mind races 
 Like Jeff Gordon 
 I'ma 
 [Chorus] (B.O.B) 
 Make a lot of money 
 (Make a lot of money) 
 And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this 
 (Quit this) 
 Crazy scene 
 (Asher) 
 It ain't supposed to be so hard 
 I always said I'd quit if it felt like a job 
 I'd rather be pissed than pretend that I'm not 
 And try to play along with the whole facade 
 I wanna 
 [Chorus] (Asher) 
 Make a lot of money 
 (Then I'm gonna) 
 And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this 
 Crazy scene 
 (B.O.B) 
 It ain't a question to me 
 Look at me 
 I know what I'm destined to be 
 This is spiritual y'all 
 I'm wrestlin' beasts 
 But pretty soon 
 I'll be restin' in peace 
 I'ma 
 [Chorus] (B.O.B) 
 Make a lot of money 
 (Make a lot of money) 
 And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this 
 (Quit this) 
 Crazy scene 
 (Asher) 
 And I don't even wanna be famous 
 And all my close friends become complete strangers 
 Don't try to tell me this is one of these stages 
 Man you don't know me, you only know what my name is 
 I'ma 
 Make a lot of money 
 And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this 
 Crazy scene 
 (B.O.B) 
 But still it just ain't enough 
 Cause the rest of the world still just wakin' up 
 So all the real niggas can relate to this stuff 
 But those who asleep, still hatin' on us 
 'Cause I'ma 
 [Chorus] (B.O.B) 
 Make a lot of money 
 (Make a lot of money) 
 And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this 
 (Quit this) 
 Crazy scene 
 (Asher) 
 It couldn't be more fake 
 When they wine and they dine and they smile and wave 
 But when it comes time to decide your fate 
 They'll sign you on the line right next to Satan 
 I'ma 
 [Chorus] (Asher) 
 Make a lot of money 
 (C'mon man) 
 And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this 
 (Quit this) 
 Crazy scene 
 (B.O.B) 
 Come y'all, y'all actin' like I can't feel you 
 I can look in your eyes and tell you what you done been through 
 And I could give a fuck because I got bigger issues 
 So at this point in my life 
 How can I get through? 
 [Chorus] (B.O.B) 
 Make a lot of money 
 (Make a lot of money) 
 And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this 
 (Quit this) 
 Crazy scene 
 (Asher) 
 Okay 
 Yeah, I'll play yo game 
 I'm in 
 I'll dance, I'll rap, I'll sing 
 And use it as a chance to provide some change 
 Just know I'll walk away at the end of the day 
 Right when I 
 [Chorus] (Asher) 
 Make a lot of money 
 (Yeah) 
 And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this 
 (Quit this) 
 Crazy scene 
 (B.O.B) 
 Look 
 This is my stress reliever 
 But somehow, it became my stress for demons 
 So I get up in this booth and I'm heated 
 Like 'Ye said 
 I'm turnin' atheists into believers 
 I'm 
 [Chorus] (B.O.B) 
 Make a lot of money 
 (Make a lot of money) 
 And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this 
 (Quit this) 
 Crazy scene 
 (B.O.B) 
 Look 
 A lot of haters attack but 
 It's my job to speak the truth on the track 
 So say what you like, you just givin' me gas 
 So by now, I got enough to drive to Venus and back 
 So I'ma 
 [Chorus] (B.O.B) 
 Make a lot of money 
 (Make a lot of money) 
 And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this 
 (Quit this) 
 Crazy scene 
 (B.O.B) 
 Fuck the money I'm leavin' 
 I'm goin' back home after I break even 
 I said what I said so as long as I'm speakin' 
 B.O.B got the upper hand as long as I'm breathin' 
 [Chorus] (B.O.B) 
 Well, I'm a make a lot of money 
 (Fuck the money) 
 And I'm-and I'm gonna quit this, quit this 
 (Quit this) 
 Crazy scene 
 I'm gone. Peace
