B.o.B: 
 Yes, I feel the end, the end is close 
 The same thing happened eon's ago 
 To know exactly you have to read up some more 
 Everyday technology speeds up some more 
 As is above, so is below 
 Some feel the heat, yet some feel the cold 
 We are the souls, yes we have been chose 
 Some roll with angels and demons and ghosts 
 But shh, hold up Bob, don't go there 
 You know that they watching, they all see and stare but 
 They can't stop me, I'm already there 
 And y'all ain't seen shit but y'all already scared 
 I'm gone, high like fructose, fructose 
 You wanna know the truth, really, you gone, you gone 
 It'll blow ya out ya mind like a UFO, UFO 
 I'm basically a resident of Pluto, Pluto 
 You know 
 But you'll probably be the same one hating 
 Saying every rapper is in the Free Masons 
 While the cops giving out free mase to your face 
 Now how do that taste? 
 I'm outta my mind 
 These video's tellin' y'all lies, bruh 
 Tellin' y'all, we holdin' evil hand signs bruh 
 Last time I checked I'm from the east side bruh 
 So do your research and make ya own mind up 
 'Cause us musicians have influence on the mic 
 But they don't like that, so they conquer and divide 
 Double-H N-D, hip hop never dies 
 So shoot all you want, but we fly 
 Because you know, no one man should have all that power 
 Obviously 'cause it's only one power 
 But never mind, y'all keep worshiping towers 
 While the clock keeps handing y'all hours 
 But pucker up because the truth gets sour 
 More sour than the sour diesel I devour 
 Hear me 'bout the hour, I give ya fifty vowels 
 When I brain storm it's like a shower 
 So pull out your towels 
 And don't let 'em play you 
 Do your own thing 
 Fuck what they do 
 And if you good at something make sure they pay you 
 And if not take a thank you 
 Whether they praise you, or whether they hate you 
 It's all about the attention that they pay you 
 Y'all on that grape drink 
 Try this grape juice 
 Shouts to Grand Hustle 
 We got that break through 
 And yes, it's evident we better than the rest of these competitors 
 Really there ain't no one else ahead of us 
 Y'all bust these verses off etc, etc 
 'Cause they watching y'all like the Federers, owww 
 Kadoosh, kadoosh, kadoosh 
 Adonai saboath. 
 It's B.O.B and I'm out 
 Peace!
