Ah, man look 
 Check it out 
 I step into the place like so 
 Feelin' real calm cool collected and composed 
 She lookin' like "Nigga, whatcha here fo'?" 
 I'm like, "Don't be actin' like I don't be givin' that doe." 
 That thing that you need 
 That thing that you know 
 If we was at sea I would not be a boat 
 'Cause I would go deep 
 Yes down deeper low 
 Right next to the P like L M N O 
 There is no expression 
 No word or phrase I know 
 That would accurately describe 
 The way I feel the most 
 'Bout them curve and the thighs 
 You know I like the most 
 And if I ever were to t-try to quit I'd just keep goin' 
 Cause just like Clarence Carter baby (I Be Strokin') 
 And you like, "Oh my God", I got you soundin' holy 
 I got a s-s-surprise. yeah that right there is golden 
 So hold it 
 Cause this is my job like it ain't nobody's business 
 Tell me whose is this? 
 B-o-Bizzless 
 Yeah yeah real dirty real gritty 
 Haha 
 And you know we like move 
 In the bedroom like boom-ba-boom-boom 
 Haha 
 Now we change up the tune 
 Now we got a new one rockin' in ooohn 
 I think it's noon and we still ain't through 
 While she in the zone I be up in that poon 
 Ewww 
 And it's just so nasty 
 That's why the sex is so damn fantastic 
 Trashy, trashy 
 You ain't gotta ask me 
 Kids close your ears cause this right here is graphic 
 Then we sit down and we brown on that cali-cali 
 Like we in Atlanta in the Caddy 
 I am not a father but she calls me "Daddy" 
 Now my confidence feels awfully fantastic 
 Ha 
 And that's why she the Cooter Club Captian 
 Cause like this beat she cla-cla-cla-clappin'
