Yeah 
 To all my smokers and my hundred blunt rollers 
 No no no no I'm talkin' bout 
 Real tokers who ain't never ever sober 
 Hahaha 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo 
 Check me out now. Check me out now 
 Go head then 
 Allow me to introduce myself again 
 Bob's out the office but Bobby Ray is in 
 Please leave a message wait, let me get a pen 
 I don't really need it 'cause I spit it off the lid 
 And every time I come around I look like I'm a pimp 
 Really that's the dip because the ? is on my hip 
 They love me 'cause I tell 'em what they really wanna hear 
 Slap her on that booty with a hundred dollar bill 
 WHAT!? 
 Nah I'm just playin' man sometimes I kid 
 Just so that my job doesn't get monotonous 
 Crumble up the bud, put it in a spliff 
 Put it in the air like I'm levitating shit 
 They say, "Bob how you feel about the fame?" 
 Really ain't famous till Obama know my name 
 The game's in a drought 
 It was going down the drain 
 When I come around man its prolly gon' rain (so what's you sayin'?) 
 Maybe I'm just sayin' I can switch up the flow 
 How you can't feel me when I'm rocking this show? 
 Going over seas to a whole 'nother coast 
 Come back get a sack full of that like whoa 
 Yeah I can take you way back like +Whoa+ 
 So listen two me rap sit back like whoa 
 And every time I rip they be like, "That's dope" 
 Yeah that's dope 
 Nitro like colt, my flow lets go 
 Haha Haha 
 (What you be done?) 
 Yeah 
 (Is that it?) 
 Hell naw, we ain't done 
 (Let's do it) 
 Need to get round two in 
 (Verse Two) 
 Oh oh oh 
 Well the biz, the biz I'm in the music biz 
 I really couldn't tell you what the main objective is 
 Cause really that depends 
 On if you got a hit or just a good song that they never ever spin 
 And then that depends on the genre that you in 
 If you're a rock artist or a hip hop blend 
 That's where I come in 
 They try to box me in 
 But I am not a square nor a parallelogram 
 Yes I got several fans through Japan to Maryland 
 They try to shoot me down but I never ever land 
 And no man could never ever walk in my pants 
 Or live what I've lived 
 Or be what I am 
 Damn 
 I don't give a damn 
 All up in this booth try to lay this shit down 
 Yeah, so let me turn it down 
 We all around it;s a mixtape now 
 Stay tuned for more 
 And don't turn the dial 
 Bloaw
