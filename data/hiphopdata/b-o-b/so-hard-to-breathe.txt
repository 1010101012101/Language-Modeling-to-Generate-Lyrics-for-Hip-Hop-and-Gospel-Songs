Since day 1 I said fuck the fame and everything it dealt 
 But the fame is really here just to facilitate the wealth 
 But the wealth attracts you haters like you mosquitoes to a well 
 And the waters getting deeper so I'm well set out to sail 
 Someone called my cell and left a voicemail 
 That said congratulations on the million record sales 
 As I'm flipping over furniture knocking shit off the shelf 
 I told myself I'll never get too deep not to take a breathe 
 But I'm sinking 
 And it's so hard to breathe, yeah 
 And even more so to sleep when no one cares 
 It was all I can eat 
 But now I'm sinking 
 So deep, I can't come up for air 
 Yeah I've seen the valley of the shadow of death 
 I've seen the mountains, the wild childhood 
 That's why I sing about it 
 I just try to move on and keep my peace about it 
 But come to think about it I can't even count the days that I've spent, starving tryna find some decent housing 
 That's why I'm always smiling but on this beat I seem so violent 
 So ask me 'bout the music scene and what the fuck I think about it 
 Time flies, I guess that's why I'm bugging 
 Just yesterday I was rapping with my brother and my cousin 
 If you had the stove or toaster on you couldn't use the oven 
 We knew that we were struggling, we just acted like we wasn't 
 It's either make it rapping, if not that than hustlin' 
 So all I see is magazine covers in this game 
 You either surface or you plummet 
 It's a thin line and I'm just tryna keep my head above it 
 Damn... 
 And it's so hard to breathe 
 And even more so to sleep when no one cares 
 It was all I can eat 
 But now I'm sinking, so deep, I can't come up for air 
 Air, I-I-I 
 I sink away, 'cause I sink away 
 I sink away 
 I sink away, I sink away 
 Get carried away, get carried away 
 And it's so hard to breathe 
 And even more so to sleep when no one cares 
 It was all I can eat 
 But now I'm sinking, so deep, I can't come up for air 
 Damn, it's never in the plans, but hey it's a long way than beating pots and pans [x3] 
 But now I'm sinking, so deep, I can't come up for air, air
