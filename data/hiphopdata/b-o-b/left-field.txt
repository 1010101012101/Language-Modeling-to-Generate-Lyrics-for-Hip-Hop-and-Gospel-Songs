The League Crew. 
 (Man talking) 
 Aye Bob! Get ini here man! Your set's ready man! 
 You're going live in 5, 4, 3, 2... 
 (Announcer talking) 
 Ladies and gentlemen, you are at Rebel Rock Cafe. 
 And who we have coming to the stage is none other than B.o.B. 
 (Crowd jeering) 
 B.O who? What? The fuck is that? I don't know who that is. 
 Who is B.o.B? 
 (B.o.B talking) 
 I don't really have shit to say. (Booo!) How y'all doin' tonight? (Fuck you nigga get off the stage!) 
 I got a little song (Don't nobody give a damn.) 
 I wrote on the way over here. (Fuck that nigga.) 
 Check it out. 
 I know that I'm 
 Left field to you, field to you, field to you 
 But don't it sound so 
 Real-to-ya, real-to-ya, real-to-ya 
 Tell me how it 
 Feel-to-you, feel-to-you, feel-to-you 
 Now don't it feel lovely? [x2] 
 Now don't it sound lovely? [x2] 
 I agree 
 (Verse One) 
 I'm playing out the left 
 Was raised up in Decatur 
 So I'm straight up out the deck 
 And G.A. is all I rep 
 And so they say that I'm obsessed 
 I grew up in the struggle so 
 Maybe I'm depressed 
 But being in the struggle is what 
 Gave me my success 
 This ain't your imagination 
 I ain't fakin it unless 
 I don't mean what I say 
 But what I say is what I stress 
 And I ain't really catholic but 
 Daily I confess 
 I ain't a Christian rapper or a civil activist 
 But everybody feel me because I say the realist shit 
 I see why haters get all mad I don't brag 
 So here is what I got to offer 
 Words of wisdom so that you can get your mind altered 
 I know that I'm 
 Left field to you, field to you, field to you 
 But don't it sound so 
 Real-to-ya, real-to-ya, real-to-ya 
 Tell me how it 
 Feel-to-you, feel-to-you, feel-to-you 
 Now don't it feel lovely? [x2] 
 Now don't it sound lovely? [x2] 
 Uh huh 
 (Verse Two) 
 I'm lovely like the left field 
 I know I ain't around shorty but I rep still 
 Don't get to thinkin' that I'm different 
 Because of the record deal 
 Turnin' Hollywood, c'mon is that real? 
 And still I got alot of agony 
 And stress on my chest 
 Cause the world ain't right 
 So I gotta come left 
 I'm a keep it 100 to the day that I rest 
 So take a deep breath, I guess 
 I know that I'm 
 Left field to you, field to you, field to you 
 But don't it sound so 
 Real-to-ya, real-to-ya, real-to-ya 
 Tell me how it 
 Feel-to-you, feel-to-you, feel-to-you 
 Now don't it feel lovely? [x2] 
 Now don't it sound lovely? [x2] 
 I agree
