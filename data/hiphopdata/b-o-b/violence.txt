Born prodigy no apologies fuck a policy 
 Fuck around and make a monster out of me 
 A monster gotta eat, coming for the weak 
 Run to your momma but it's late and your momma gotta sleep 
 I apologize for the violence 
 I swear I'm killing every single thing I touch 
 Let's have a moment of silence 
 For anyone that thinks that I could give two fucks 
 I apologize for the violence 
 I apologize for the violence 
 In this game friendships don't last long 
 It that's about as long as a hit song 
 So I keep a full clip full of hit songs 
 So when I get to busting it's a shit storm 
 Everyone's a bit dumb, let that bitch hum 
 Roll the drum till I get it out my system 
 Line them all up, wack niggas first 
 Take them out the game won't think twice, won't miss one 
 When you hot imitators try to mimic you 
 'Fore I was hot I was begging for an interview 
 There's only one of me, but there's a million yous 
 If you was that important then I'd remember you 
 Well I get I'm too in the mix 
 Next known flow I'm on some Jupiter shit 
 Hundred deep on some hooligan shit 
 Killing everything I see on some funeral shit 
 I apologize for the violence 
 I swear I'm killing every single thing I touch 
 Let's have a moment of silence 
 For anyone that thinks I could give two fucks 
 I apologize for the violence 
 I apologize for the violence
