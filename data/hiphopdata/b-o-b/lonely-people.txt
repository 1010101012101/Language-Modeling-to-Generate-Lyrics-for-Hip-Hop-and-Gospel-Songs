 "I look at all the lonely people" 
 "I look at all the lonely people"

 I see 'em, I see 'em, I see 'em, there they go

 [Verse One]: 
 Cindy Lavinsky 
 Went to her school where the kids that she did meet 
 Did not treat her friendly 
 She in elementary 
 So when she went home, it was wrong evidently 
 So lonely and empty 
 Well, lookin' for love in a club got her drunk 
 Met a thug named Bud, got her pregnant with a son 
 Here he come 
 In a sub-division there's a couple engaged in a fuss 
 One of them grabs a gun {gun cocks} 
 In the street, all alone, there's a kid 
 Tryin' to wipe away the tears after what his momma did 
 There it is

 Penny Lavinsky 
 Adopted at three, a foster home's where he's livin' 
 His pockets are empty 
 So when he turns 16 
 He just ran away and then he moved to the city 
 And had a daughter named Lizzy 
 Well, in a mansion, in a room, on a bed 
 There's a girl so depressed 
 From the drugs and the stress 
 All the diamonds on her dress still can not relieve stress 
 That she faces from the world 
 Why these niggas offer it? 
 Evidence she's obsessed, but what she feels she can't express 
 All she want is happiness 
 But all she know is big success 
 Nothin' less

 I see 'em, I see 'em, I see 'em, there they go 
 I know that you've been havin' a lonely day 
 All you gotta do, is find a way 
 Maybe in your dreams you can fly away 
 Away, away, away
