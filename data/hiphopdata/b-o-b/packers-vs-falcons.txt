 And the city of brother they love, now they looking up 
 Birds of prey hovering above

 Michael Turner is likely to earn him a couple of jaws 
 But the packers a whole new encore 
 And meanwhile the dirty bird ridey, ... got his winning wings on, he's about to take flight

 Can be the difference between the losers and all the great tools really who's silly and who's fake
