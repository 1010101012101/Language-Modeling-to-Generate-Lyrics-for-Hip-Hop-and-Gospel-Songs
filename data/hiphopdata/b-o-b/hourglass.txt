My baby's got an hourglass 
 Wanna know wanna know what time it is 
 Turn it over like an hourglass 
 Yeah you know, yeah you know, what time it is 
 Yeah you know, yeah you know, what time it is 
 Work it, work it, baby move, time be stopping when you drop it 
 Want you 'round you ticking, tocking 
 Know they got me when you clock in 
 Put it on, put it on, lay on me girl 
 Put it on, put it on, put it on 
 Put it on, put it on, lay on me girl 
 Put it on, put it on, put it on 
 Put it on me like sand through an hourglass 
 These are the days of our lives, type of girl you try to make her your wife 
 Got a trophy I don't play for the league but she can get this recreational D, okay 
 Go and put your hourglass on my three legged stand, right 
 Pussy singing like, Tina back when she first got that advance, 'ight? 
 Beat it up like boogie nights, boogie nights 
 Ooh-ooh, girl won't you give me that sweet sensation 
 Ain't nothing wrong with a little temptation 
 My baby's got an hourglass 
 Wanna know wanna know what time it is 
 Turn it over like an hourglass 
 Yeah you know, yeah you know, what time it is 
 Yeah you know, yeah you know, what time it is 
 Work it, work it, baby move, time be stopping when you drop it 
 Want you 'round you ticking, tocking 
 Know they got me when you clock in 
 Put it on, put it on, lay on me girl 
 Put it on, put it on, put it on 
 Put it on, put it on, lay on me girl 
 Put it on, put it on, put it on 
 Put it on, take it off 
 Lay it down baby, tablecloth 
 Cheers to the good night, make a toast 
 You be doin' everything but the most 
 Put my hands on the hourglass, grippin' ass 
 Rollin' weed, call it multitask 
 Niggas multiask like, "What's your number like, 
 You look good like, what you doin' later like, 
 Can I come through and spend some time or..?" 
 Ooh-ooh, girl won't you give me that sweet sensation 
 Ain't nothing wrong with a little temptation 
 My baby's got an hourglass 
 Wanna know wanna know what time it is 
 Turn it over like an hourglass 
 Yeah you know, yeah you know, what time it is 
 Yeah you know, yeah you know, what time it is 
 Work it, work it, baby move, time be stopping when you drop it 
 Want you 'round you ticking, tocking 
 Know they got me when you clock in 
 Put it on, put it on, lay on me girl 
 Put it on, put it on, put it on 
 Put it on, put it on, lay on me girl 
 Put it on, put it on, put it on 
 Ooh-ooh, girl won't you give me that sweet sensation 
 Ain't nothing wrong with a little temptation
