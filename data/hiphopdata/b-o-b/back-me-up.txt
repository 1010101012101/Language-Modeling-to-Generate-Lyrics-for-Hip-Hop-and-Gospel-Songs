 Everywhere I plant my feet, everybody know 'bout me nigga 
 I ain't gotta say one word, I ain't gotta show ID nigga 
 Back when I was in 10th grade, I saved up, got a set of gold teeth 
 And I took 'em out but 7 years later I got 7 sets of gold teeth 
 Nigga I'm Bobby Bands, I do that 
 Private jet I flew that 
 40K I threw that 
 A quarter pound, I blew that 
 It sounds crazy but it ain't nothing it 
 She a freak but I already knew it 
 She looked at me and said I'm yo biggest fan 
 I told her if it's real then tattoo it 
 Every day I wake up, smoking like Jamaicans 
 Like an occupation, this is so outrageous 
 Head so good I makein' Bill Cosby faces 
 Giving that good and like the middle wafers 
 Free to the carpet, into the office 
 Then to the closet, many different flavors 
 Someone said my love you're called a label 
 And tell 'em hurry up with the paper

 You niggas tryna act like B.o.B ain't go 
 Man, stop that shit

 You gotta block that shit fool 
 Look at this resume, can't nobody top that shit 
 And unless you the girl I'm fuckin' 
 Then you don't really need to be owned by a bitch like that uhm 
 Like that huh 
 Take a second, let me get it right back huh 
 They was hopin' I'd probably fall off, right? 
 But all I feel was them haters on my back, yeah 
 I ain't even got no genre 
 But this ganja gives contact, yeah 
 Well how the hell they gon' call us the rap game 
 When most of y'all niggas can't rap 
 Most of y'all niggas so whack 
 Most of y'all ain't got, most of y'all ain't got no swag 
 Most of y'all bad, most of y'all niggas so flaw 
 And all real niggas know that 
 Cause see this is not necessarily based on dexterity 
 Cause the things they tellin' me is I'm good as I'll ever be 
 I'm good as I'll ever be 
 In the hood I'm incredibly understood 'cause it's definitely in my blood 
 I'mma paint off you nigga
