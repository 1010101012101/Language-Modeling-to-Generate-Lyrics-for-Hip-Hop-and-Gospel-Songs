 Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars? 
 I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now 
 Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars? 
 I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now 
 B.o.B 
 Dreaming (oh oh oh oh) 
 Of falling (mm mm mm mm) 
 Dreaming (oh oh oh oh) 
 Of falling (oh oh oh oh) 
 (Yeah) Let's pretend like it's '98 
 Like I'm eating lunch off of styrofoam trays 
 Trying to be the next rapper comin' out the A (A-town) 
 Hoping for a record deal to ignore my pain (yeah) 
 Now let's pretend like I'm on the stage 
 And when my beat drops everybody goes insane (woo!) 
 Okay, and everybody know my name (B.o.B) 
 And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sing (oh) 
 Oh yeah, and I just dropped my new album 
 On the first week I did five hundred thousand 
 Gold in the spring and diamond in the fall 
 And then a world tour just to top it all off 
 And let's pretend like they called me the greatest 
 Selling out arenas with big ass stages 
 And everybody loved me and no one ever hated 
 Let's try to use imagination

 Okay let's pretend like this never happened (never) 
 Like I never had dreams of being a rapper (rapper) 
 Like I didn't write raps up in all of my classes 
 Like I never used to run away into the blackness 
 Now let's pretend like it was all good (good) 
 Like I didn't live staring in a notebook (notebook) 
 Like I did the things that I probably knew I should (should) 
 But I ain't have neighbors, that's why they call it hood (hood, yeah) 
 Now let's pretend like I ain't got a name 
 Before they ever call me B.o.B a.k.a. Bobby Ray 
 I'm talking back before the mixtapes (yeah) 
 Before the videos and the deals and the fame 
 Before they ever once compared me to Andr√© 
 Before I ever got on MySpace 
 Before they ever noticed my face 
 So let's just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes

 And it seems like yesterday 
 It was just a dream 
 But those days are gone (gone, gone) 
 And just memories (oh, oh) 
 And it seems like yesterday 
 It was just a dream 
 But those days are gone (gone gone)

 All right let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen 
 Let's pretend things would have been no different 
 Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation 
 Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin 
 They could blow away with the wind 
 Marshall you're never gonna make it 
 Makes no sense to play the game 
 There ain't no way that you'll win 
 Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends 
 Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend 
 And it wasn't time to move and schools were changing again 
 He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid 
 He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit 
 And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit 
 Fuck a talent show in a gymnasium, bitch 
 You won't amount to shit, quit daydreaming kid 
 You need to get your cranium checked 
 You thinking like an alien it just ain't realistic 
 Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit 
 And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed it 
 And his alarm went off to wake him off 
 But he didn't make it to the rap Olympics 
 Slept through his plane and he missed it 
 He's gon' have a hard time explaining to Hailey and Laney 
 These food stamps and this WIC shit 
 'Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it 
 But it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even here 
 He pretends that...

 I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

 I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
