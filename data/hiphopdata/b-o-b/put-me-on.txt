When I wake up from a full night of sleep, 
 I put my best foot forward indeed, 
 And as the colors begin to sink, 
 They seem to say to me, C'mon, 
 [X4]C'mon, C'mon, ya gotta put me on, (You gotta put me on) 
 Ever since I first arrived here, 
 I've been, on the run like an eye tear, 
 And it, took me a while to get my life steered, 
 But now I'm in the moment, 
 While I reside here, 
 Yeah, 
 That's why I coordinate with my gear, 
 So you could feel the Feng Shui, soon as I'm near, 
 Yeah, 
 And people have the nerve to say that I'm weird? 
 But you just in a box, 
 So get your mind clear, 
 Yeah, Yeah, 
 That good music man, we gotta hear, 
 So we could get the vibe high, like a light gear, 
 Or maybe, 
 Fly high like five deer, 
 Call me Santa Claus, 
 When I come through I gotta put 'em on... 
 (Voice Echoey) 
 On... 
 I gotta put 'em on... 
 Well, ever since I was eleven, 
 I have, found heaven in my self expression, 
 Hah, 
 Nope, my childhood I never left it, 
 Yes, I'm still a big kid, though I never stress it, 
 Yet, memory is ever lastin, 
 So, I make moves with a special method, 
 That, allow my dreams to get manifested, 
 So your plastic Promise Land, no, I can't accept it, 
 Hah, 
 This life I lead is a very blessed one, 
 So, that's why fans have many questions, 
 Hah, 
 Yet, I still leave any guessin, 
 I'm an artist so I gotta have a bad collection, 
 I put 'em on... 
 (Voice Echoey) 
 I put'em on... 
 [X4]C'mon, C'mon, ya gotta put me on, (You gotta put me on) 
 [X4]You gotta put me on...
