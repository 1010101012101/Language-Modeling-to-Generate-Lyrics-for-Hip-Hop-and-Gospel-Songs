 Fame fame fame fame fame 
 Famous, everybody wanna be famous 
 Most people wanna just taste it 
 Other people trynna just sneak in the v.i.p and chill with the big faces 
 They don't really see them changes, when the fame hits 
 When I'm up on the stage they sing it but soon as I step off they hate it 
 And I'm saying I really ain't with that complaining just look at the picture I'm painting 
 Yeah I pay my rent, vacation then, take trips all around the equator then 
 Come back to the A hit the stage again, then I go up in the booth 
 Where they cage me in, feel regular but then I go insane again 
 If you witness the condition that my brain is in 
 You would see I'm in hell where Satan is, 
 All I'm saying to do is to maintain a friend cause everybody trynna get 
 Paid from me but f-ck it this is the entertainment biz so let the games begin I mean let the flames 
 Begin but hey I'm just trained in this, not like everybody didn't get paid from me

 Little kids just be watchin' us through binoculars and then they go to school and copy us 
 But hey I'm not knockin' y'all but how can y'all not see it's obvious 
 Cause cops just be ploting on us and paparazzi be spottin' us 
 Cause everybody just wanna be on MTV or BET or 
 Maybe season MVP or maybe even just (poppin' the queen?) 
 But everybody can't be a G, O to the D and everybody can't be O to the B, 
 But I don't know maybe this is just how it's supposed to be 
 But this is what'll happen to y'all 
 You can go crazy and beat on drums 
 The tabloids sayin' that you're hooked on drugs 
 You cuttin' up your face then sew a back up
