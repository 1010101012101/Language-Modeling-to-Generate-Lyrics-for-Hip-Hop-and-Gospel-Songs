(Screaming) 
 Imagine a world where your greatest fears become reality 
 AAAA! They're pausing me! 
 Welcome to Fear Factor 
 Each show's six contestants come around the country battle each other in four extreme stunts 
 Ah fuck! 
 These stunts are designed to challenge the contestants both physically... 
 (Clawing noises) 
 And mentally (growl) 
 If a contestant is to afraid to complete a stunt, they're eliminated 
 (No way I'm doing that. It's so dangerous) 
 If they fail at stunts, they're eliminated 
 But if they succeed, they are one step closer to the grand prise: fifty thousand dollars 
 Six contestants, four stunts, one winner 
 (Yeah!)

 Welcome to Fear Factor 
 The stunts you are about to see, were designed and supervised by trained professionals 
 They are extremely dangerous, and should not be attempted by anyone, anywhere, anytime.
