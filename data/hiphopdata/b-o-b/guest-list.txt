(Hook: Roscoe Dash) 
 I be over here, I be over there 
 You be on the outside wishin you were here 
 I be at the club, I be at the spot 
 You be talkin' big but you really really not 
 'Cause you ain't me and I ain't' you 
 I Ain't even gotta try, this is what I do 
 Cause you ain't me and I ain't' you 
 I Ain't even gotta try, this is what I do 
 This is what I do 
 (Verse 1: B.o.B) 
 This is how my day go 
 Wake up, cross over, fade ho 
 I wake up with that leggo, 28 flow but I lay low 
 No lease 'cause it's paid fo, stack chips with my queso 
 Straight shots no hangover, real bitches, no fake hoes 
 Two chicks in Barbados, we bait ho's like bagels 
 Hasta luego, Lobsta Alfredo 
 Authentic Italian linguine, Pasta, no Prego 
 Call me lieutenant, ridin' in a whip windows tinted 
 Got a tour bus with a room in it 
 Loud pack, no stems, no seeds in it 
 When I ride on the beat, man I grove in it 
 Hell yes sir, I handle business 
 I'm so prolific, it's impostor-ing and no pretending 
 (Verse 2: Roscoe Dash) 
 Do it, do it, I did it, did it 
 It's done, it's finished 
 Yes I put it over a time to mix it 
 Mine I spin it, man I got hits on hits on hits 
 So why the hell they keep on pitchin' 
 Got a whole lot of haters who don't add me when they missin' 
 My music is like a drug and I'm just feelin' enough prescription 
 That's school and put the beat it at the school detention 
 Got me Captain Hook man after low murder make me a burger 
 I'm so further like the place that you ain't heard of pound worker 
 See I get out hand to my building I am so ambitious 
 I got big dough that's biscuit [?] 
 So when I walk around that's fitness I pass fur when I visit 
 Overseas ball no pivot you talk about it and I love it 
 (Verse 3: B.o.B) 
 Grand hustle 
 Since day one you heard me 
 From the underground to the surface 
 I rose out of the fire, I emerged out of the furnace 
 But I knew that my time would come, And I couldn't be more deserving 
 Man I swear I'm good for life, but still I'm far away from perfect 
 Shit I'm straight like 12: 30 
 Call me the good, I'm burping 
 Chillin' with brown sugar and cinnamon 
 One butter scotch and one Hershey (Good God) 
 With a booty so big you can probably Google Earth it 
 I'm a hit it girl with that long jump, With hat Jackie Joyner, that Kersee 
 Now squirt for me, twerk it for me 
 I'm the professor of Real Nigga University 
 I hold my team down, anchorman Ron Burgundy 
 I'm tryin' tell you man, I'm sharper than surgery 
 Bobby Ray!
