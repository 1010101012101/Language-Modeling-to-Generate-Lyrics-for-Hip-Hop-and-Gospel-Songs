Psychedelic thoughts, psychedelic calls 
 From these psychedelic trees and I think it's rubbing off on me 
 I think it's rubbing off on me, I think it's rubbing off 
 Faded memories, every face I can't recall 
 Who the fuck are you, we was never cool, you ain't my dog homie 
 You ain't my dog, don't reach 
 Yeah, yeah, you ain't my dog 
 Psychedelic thoughts, psychedelic calls 
 From these psychedelic trees and I think it's rubbing off on me 
 I think it's rubbing off on me, I think it's rubbing off 
 Faded memories, every face I can't recall 
 Who the fuck are you, we was never cool, you ain't my dog homie 
 You ain't my dog, don't reach 
 Yeah, yeah, you ain't my dog 
 I'm searching for an outlet tryna charge my phone 
 Looking through my contacts ain't no one to call 
 Questions that need answers, looking for escape 
 I'm just looking for that high, can ya help me elevate? 
 Can ya, can ya help me elevate? 
 Can ya help me elevate? 
 Can ya help me elevate? 
 Can ya help me elevate? 
 Imagine modern day civilisation as we know it just collapsing 
 Television screens and news reports just serve as a distraction 
 Propaganda got our minds so flooded that we just paddlin' 
 Damn it, drowing for air, we keep gaspin' for breath 
 I take a step, you take a step, I take a step 
 Living out our dreams till nothing's left, till there ain't none left 
 Bury me in honor, we will not forget to fallen soldiers 
 I pay respect, I pay respect, I wear the burden 
 Of the world ever since I travelled on a jet 
 To a far away place in a third-world city where the whole damn country was oppressed 
 Couldn't help but stomach what I saw but still my conscious was upset 
 With all the money in the world but [?] I can't express 
 Some thoughts is trapped inside my head so I roll a blunt to ease my stress 
 [?] through the USA where people constantly obsess 
 Over all this shit that wouldn't matter if we knew what was ahead 
 Signing off, psychedelic thoughts running through my head 
 Psychedelic thoughts, psychedelic calls 
 From these psychedelic trees and I think it's rubbing off on me 
 I think it's rubbing off on me, I think it's rubbing off 
 Faded memories, every face I can't recall 
 Who the fuck are you, we was never cool, you ain't my dog homie 
 You ain't my dog, don't reach 
 Yeah, yeah, you ain't my dog 
 Psychedelic thoughts, psychedelic calls 
 From these psychedelic trees and I think it's rubbing off on me

 You ain't my dog, don't reach
