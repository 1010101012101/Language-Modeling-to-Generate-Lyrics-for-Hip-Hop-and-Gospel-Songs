And there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no 
 And you don't know where to go, 'cause you're in the rain 
 And there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no 
 And you don't know where to go, but you're in the rain 
 And it keeps pouring down on you, the suns gone and your feelin' blue 
 And it's pouring down on you, but you keep on movin' through 
 And it's pouring down on you, the suns gone and your feelin' blue 
 And there you are standing all alone in the rain 
 And the rain comes pouring down 
 Yeah yeah 
 (Verse One) 
 By no means am I livin' in vain, but I 
 Sit in the rain, I'm addicted to pain yeah 
 It feels good when it enters my veins 
 And every time I wake up it's a similar day 
 'Cause I'm stuck in my ways 
 And everywhere I go the suns runnin' away 
 But this is what I get for my troublesome ways 
 So here comes the rain to fuck up my parade 
 I ain't got nothing to say 
 And there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no 
 And you don't know where to go, 'cause you're in the rain 
 And there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no 
 And you don't know where to go, but you're in the rain 
 And it keeps pouring down on you, the suns gone and your feelin' blue 
 And it's pouring down on you, but you keep on movin' through 
 And it's pouring down on you, the suns gone and your feelin' blue 
 And there you are standing all alone in the rain 
 And the rain comes pouring down 
 Yeah yeah 
 (Verse Two) 
 And as I fall into the rain 
 Swimmin' through the flood, tryin' to unclog the drain 
 If you tryin' to find me my address is Memory Lane 
 Livin' amongst the darkness, so the dungeon is my domain 
 Higher than the mountains feeling lower than the plains 
 But this is what I chose so how can I complain? 
 And tryin' to find some brain is, really not my aim 
 Stuck inside my head, so it replays again 
 And there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no 
 And you don't know where to go, 'cause you're in the rain 
 And there you are standing all alone, in the rain like oh no 
 And you don't know where to go, but you're in the rain 
 And it keeps pouring down on you, the suns gone and your feelin' blue 
 And it's pouring down on you, but you keep on movin' through 
 And it's pouring down on you, the suns gone and your feelin' blue 
 And there you are standing all alone in the rain 
 And the rain comes pouring down 
 Yeah yeah
