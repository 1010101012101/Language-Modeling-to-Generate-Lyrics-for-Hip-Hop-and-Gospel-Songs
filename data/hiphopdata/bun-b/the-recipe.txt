Today we gonna be making crack> 
 Take 36 ounces of coke 
 With water in a pot on the stove 
 Step to make them boulders add 
 If the flame is low then turn it up whoa! 
 Just wait 
 Then bag it up 
 You got the key homie 
 That's the recipe 
 (e-40) 
 Before you decide to elect yourself in the game of dope 
 Better know that it is cut throat 
 Can't be cracking under pressure when your backed in a corner 
 Against the ropes 
 They ain't calling it snitching no more 
 They calling it telling the truth 
 They say you better get down first before they decide to get down on you 
 Mixing it up 
 Shake and bake 
 Its 2008, they got more data than '88 
 We used to make crazy cake, crazy cake 
 Flipping weight, flipping weight 
 Got get in and out before it be too late 
 I don't want to be 6 feet under 
 So I pack and tote my thump 
 Suckers want to hate and block my thunder 
 'Cause I got more kicks than a punter 
 Murder rates go up in the summer 
 Killers go hunting like a hunter 
 You can live good for 6 years 
 Then it's football numbers 
 (Gucci Mane) 
 Chef for the year, better yet the fucking century 
 Dread head killers with me before deh dem up insulate 
 I'm in the kitchen scrapping up the pottery 
 Working with my hands like the maestro at the symphony 
 Sniff, I'm cocaine-a, shawty take a whiff off me 
 Stiff a liffy pisso nigga come and comprehend from me 
 Talk slick to me, E40 style, you hearing me? 
 Got a green skirt and I bought it off a recipe 
 Hella p's, hella keys, yellow, purple, red'ly 
 Put me in the feds if these crackers on the recipe 
 33 yellow D's purchased off my recipe 
 Heavy cocaine-a G 
 Plus I got a recipe 
 (Bun B) 
 Well it's Chef Boy A-Bun B 
 The king of the kitchen 
 I got exactly what you need to do your thing when you pitching 
 Guarantee to add a few layers of bling on your stitching 
 Being teeded in your chest get you stinging and itching 
 Got to have the right ingredients before you can start 
 Like 1 part gangsterism 1 part heart 
 2 parts of keeping it G and add you 100 milligrams of a killer man and you'd had done it 
 Put it all inside a Cadillac with them 3's and them 4's 
 Swing wide and mix scurrily while skating on vogues 
 Don't forget to shake them haters off homie that's a necessity 
 Now you done made you a trill nigga 
 Now that's the recipe
