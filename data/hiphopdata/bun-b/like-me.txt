You can look at my life, 
 And see what I see, 
 But you can never, 
 You can never do it like me, 
 You can never, 
 You can never do it like me, 
 Like me. 
 Baby we go hard, 
 Since my mama burnt me, 
 Said I was a shawty, 
 Fighting around in the nursery, 
 Never new my father, 
 So I grew up early, 
 I never had no business 
 Like a n**** in his thirty's. 
 Now that money ain't a problem, 
 Livin' like we moppin', 
 Care about the boulevard, 
 That's why we go hard, 
 'Cause once upon a time we were at the bottom, 
 And I really hated being on the bottom, 
 Up, up in that third wall, 
 I would write songs, 
 'Bout the day I could turn the lights on, 
 That I could see the day, 
 That I could perform, 
 In front of these crowds, 
 Look at me now, 
 That's why I say. 
 You can look at my life, 
 And see what I see, 
 But you can never, 
 You can never do it like me, 
 You can never, 
 You can never do it like me, 
 Like me. 
 You can look at my life, 
 And see what I see, 
 But you can never, 
 You can never do it like me, 
 You can never, 
 You can never do it like me, 
 Like me. 
 Like me, 
 Never do it like me, 
 Do it like me. 
 I saw this hard work, 
 Hadn't been rewarded, 
 Dedicated my life tryin' to get it, 
 Oh stay true to yourself don't fraught it, 
 Never talked about it, 
 Everybody live it, 
 Calling the shots now, 
 I'm the boss man 
 Got the whole wideworld in my hand, 
 I'm at the top now, 
 But I did it my way, 
 Told them haters hit the highway, 
 Said I remember those days 
 I would write songs, 
 About the day I could turn the lights on, 
 That I could see the day, 
 That I could perform, 
 In front of these crowds, 
 Look at me now 
 That's why I say 
 You can look at my life, 
 And see what I see, 
 But you can never, 
 You can never do it like me, 
 You can never, 
 You can never do it like me, 
 Like me. 
 You can look at my life, 
 And see what I see, 
 But you can never, 
 You can never do it like me, 
 You can never, 
 You can never do it like me, 
 Like me.
