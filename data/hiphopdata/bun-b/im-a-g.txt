 I'm a G Nigga you don't know about me. 
 I'm a G Nigga you don't know about me 
 But yo ass gonna learn and yo ass gonna see. 
 I stand 5 foot 10,200 and half 100 percent gangsta 
 Don't smile and don't laugh in a 3X shirt nigga 38 waist. 
 I ain't small mothafucka I'm takin' up some space with a size 11 shoe 
 That'll kick you in yo face

 Stay still nigga flava duece duece in a third teflon 
 Coverin yo body juice loose on a curve 
 I serve it like a tennis ball straight up deminish y'all 
 I positon and competition and when I finish 
 Y'all can clear the calendar and call the coronor tell his next of ken 
 We shot him like a cracker and stabbed him up like a Mexican 
 May he never plex again not like he can 
 But just in case he get resurrected is best he understands 
 I see these niggaz doin' a lot of talkin' 
 But they never back it up 'bout the work they movin or the paper 
 They stackin up you niggaz 
 You niggas got me crack it up 
 The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets and we ain't buyin'em 
 So pack it up 84's 
 Click clack it up and down towners from westside to the east 
 We keep the G and that's a promise 
 Bunch of black Osamas, americas most wanted 
 With criminal backgrounds and ready to straight flaunt it 
 All it take is a salt dropper instagator 
 Messy mothafuckas got the make it fo and a instant hater 
 I'm a lay you down like a baby 
 Ready to nap 'cause I'm a trill nigga ready to clap 
 Now wats hap 
 I slap a nigga stupid a back hand left 
 And continue till nobody from yo whack clan left 
 Bet you might cheat death 
 And you might cheat the dealer 
 But you neva cheat the king of the underground on the rella

 Get it from they talkin' shit is best interest is to get a gun 
 Grab the mac 9 and spit half a clip and them niggaz run. 
 Sissy niggaz sweeter then a cinnabun

 I hold my city down like I anchor eyim.
