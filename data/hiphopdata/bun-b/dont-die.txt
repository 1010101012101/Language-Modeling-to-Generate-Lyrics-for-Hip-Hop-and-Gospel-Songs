You can run for your life 
 You can stay here and fight 
 Just don't die (don't die) 
 Just don't die, die, die, die 
 You can open your mind 
 You can fall you can fly 
 Just don't die (don't die) 
 Just don't die, die, die, die 
 (Bun B) 
 Look here homeboy its time to stop playin' 
 The world is gettin' crazy especially the hood I stay in 
 The old ways of the world is just decayin' 
 For better or for worse, I don't no, but all I'm sayin' 
 Is day in and day out is the same old same, the same old players and the same old game 
 We make a couple dollars then we spend it 
 Herdin in the drop but we always pretend it 
 Like it's all good but it's all bad cause its slow, and we really can't move it like we used to no more (no more) 
 So we hustle just to keep up the illusion, we always winnin' we all or we losin' 
 Lets keep it real, don't sweep the shit under the rug 
 Don't nobody die rich from selling drugs 
 They just die (just die, just die) 
 Now that's cold but that's true, so tell me what the fuck is yo ass gon' do 
 You can run for your life 
 You can stay here and fight 
 Just don't die (don't die) 
 Just don't die, die, die, die 
 You can open your mind 
 You can fall you can fly 
 Just don't die (don't die) 
 Just don't die, die, die, die 
 (Talib kweli) 
 Damn it feels good to see people up on it 
 You can feel it in the air like sequel up on it 
 They don't know I'm rich, 'cause I don't flaunt it 
 Already a target like the local with the scope on it 
 Ate the food on your plate, I'm back for seconds 
 U dude's got it backward like the black sabbath record, check it 
 It's like they tryin' to get the message 
 We deep in the recession people reachin' for their weapons, bleh 
 Hunger said it make a peaceful mutherfucker violent 
 Motivation niggas b whilin when their stomach growls 
 Express yourself to strength in numbers no one wants an honest speak your mind, but always respect the code of silence (shhhhh) 
 Brooklyn dudes quick to buck ya 
 But the quick its sticky the blood is too thick 
 The quicker picker upers, hey 
 You can bring bounty, shit its in your clothes 
 Bring dounty 
 You can't get rid of it 
 You can run for your life 
 You can stay here and fight 
 Just don't die (don't die) 
 Just don't die, die, die, die 
 You can open your mind 
 You can fall you can fly 
 Just don't die (don't die) 
 Just don't die, die, die, die 
 (I mean... ill roots)
