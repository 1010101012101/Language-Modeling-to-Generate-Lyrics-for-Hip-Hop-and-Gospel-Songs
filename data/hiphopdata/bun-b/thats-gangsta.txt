 This for my Trill gangsta's, let's do it. 
 (Chorus: Sean Kingston) 
 I'm a full time hustler, posted on the block 
 Gotta get it t'how I live & I'm never gon' stop 
 Now That's Gangsta... 
 Now That's Gangsta... 
 When me ride t'ru the hood, you can hear the bass knock 
 All the girl them love me, me have the city locked 
 Now That's Gangsta... 
 Now That's Gangsta... Hey. 
 Bun B: 
 Mayne I'm a gangsta, G A N G S T A mayne 
 A gangsta, the best to come up out of PA, mayne 
 A gangsta, seldom seen, but always heard 
 A 
 real 
 gangsta, more than just a 7 letter word (fo' real!) 
 A gangsta ain't your clothes, a gangsta ain't your hat. 
 Your watch, rang and chain - naw, a gangsta ain't that! (at all!) 
 A gangsta can have that, but he ain't gotta show it. (why?) 
 'Cause with or without it he's still a gangsta and you know it 
 From my head to my toe wit it, it ain't hard to see 
 That I'm a gangsta, ain't too many as hard as me 
 You claimin' G, but you ain't gangsta jack 
 So tell all them fake gangsta's 
 I'm comin' to take gangsta back. Now That's Gangsta! 
 (Chorus: Sean Kingston)

 Now That's Gangsta... 
 Now That's Gangsta... 
 When me ride t'ru the hood, you can hear the bass knock 
 All the girl them love me, me have the city locked 
 Now That's Gangsta... 
 Now That's Gangsta... Hey. 
 Bun B: 
 Mayne I'm a gangsta, now let me tell you what that means 
 See I'm a gangsta, always got my mind on my green 
 And I'm a gangsta, always gon' do what I gotta do. Yep! 
 Unless it's givin' game to police and sellin' out his crew. (naw!) 
 That's somethin' gangsta's don't do, gangsta's keep it Trill. (Trill) 
 A gangsta do a crime, he do his time on the real. (real) 
 A gangsta don't squeal and tell on everyone he know 
 Put a jacket on your boy, you ain't a gangsta, youse a hoe! (a hoe!) 
 A gangsta holds his homeboy's down when they gone. (gone) 
 A gangsta put him back on his feet when they home. (home) 
 A gangsta is a homeboy that never turn his back 
 On another real homey, that's a well known fact and That's Gangsta!

 Bun B: 
 Mayne I'm a gangsta, call me the hood superstar 
 And I'm a gangsta, ridin' in my candy painted car 
 'Cause see a gangsta, always down to rep for his hood 
 And to do a little bad, so I can do a little good 
 A gangsta don't forget where he came from, no matter where he go or where he been 
 Keep it gangsta till the end 
 'Cause I'm a gangsta, yep & I'm a always love my city 
 Make money but don't act like I'm above my city (Never!) 
 'Cause gangsta's, will always give back to the ghetto 
 And gangsta's, will never turn they back to the ghetto 
 That's a fact in the ghetto, it's never been a lie. 
 So I'm a keep it gangsta till the day that I die, now That's Gangsta!
