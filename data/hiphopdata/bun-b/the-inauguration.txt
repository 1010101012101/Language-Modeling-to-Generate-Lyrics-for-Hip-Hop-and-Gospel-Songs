Ladies and Gentlemen of the Southern States of America 
 We Are Gathered Here Today To Bring You The Beginning Of A New Era 
 And Now The Speaker Of The South, Jay Prince. 
 (Jay Prince) 
 Ah yeah 
 Rap a -lot back in the house, once again 
 With the trillest of the trill, Bun B, the new President of the South 
 Yo Bun, it's yo time, 
 And we dedicate this one to all our brothers and sisters, 
 Who suffer, at the hands of the innocent 
 (Bun B) 
 It's been a long time comin' but it finally came, 
 For Bun B to get his muthafuckin' shot at the game. 
 I put mo' work in than the average trill nigga can put, 
 And I'm a gangsta from my head to my foot, blacker than soot. 
 I got the Hood behind me, 
 The Streets co-signed me, head ? in the ghetto, 
 Mayn you know where to find me. 
 The mission is laid out, 
 And the vision is clear, 
 From this moment I run the South, 
 And everything down here. 
 That go from corners to cuts, 
 Trap spots to blocks, 
 Whether it's rappin' or work, 
 I got the shit on lock. 
 I ain't all with that back talkin', sneak this in a plexion, 
 I'ma tell ya how I feel 'cause I'm a God Damn Texan. 
 'Bout time for me to start eliminatin' the frauds, 
 'Cause it's a White House of cards, 
 And it's filled with broads 
 We gone run them hoes out and bring them Trill niggas in, 
 'Cause what happened in New Orleans should never happen again. 
 They be sittin' on they ass doin' much about nothing, 
 For too God Damn long, and I'm tired of the frontin'. 
 I'ma instigate a change from the muthafuckin' top, 
 'Cause this bullshit they pullin' on my people gotta stop. 
 So I'm here to make a stand, 
 And take up the slack, 
 Dirty South rest easy, 
 I gotcha muthafuckin' back. 
 It's a new king on the throne, 
 And his chrown is a hat, 
 That says FREE PIMP C, 
 Now what's fuckin' with that? 
 Hail to the chief
