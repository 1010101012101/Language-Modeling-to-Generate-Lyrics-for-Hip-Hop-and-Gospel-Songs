Paybacks a motherfucker 
 This is where we take a journey called karma 
 What goes around comes back round 
 Especially in the rules of these streets 
 It's a bloody war in the rules of engagement 
 Eye for an eye tooth for a tooth 
 Justice in the eyes of a gangster 
 Hey, Mr. Preacher man what do you say, 
 See you out here tryin' to save yourself some people today 
 You got the good book in your and a robe on your back 
 Steppin' out your 2008 Escalade Cadillac 
 You standin' up in the pulpit lookin' out at the peau 
 Preachin' the good word and tellin' Christian folks what to do 
 You talkin' 'bout the sinners and sinnnin' but lets keep it true 
 Ain't nobody in this church a bigger sinner than you 
 Lets chapter this, first pact, pass the plate, pay your ties 
 Puttin' rings on your fingers and rims on your ride 
 You don't need a thousand dollar suit just pray in 
 Or a million dollar house for you to stay in 
 Marriage counseling but cheating on your own wife 
 Undercover pedifiler even in your own right 
 Let the door knob hit'cha where the good lord split'cha 
 You's a dirty motherfucker so its time to get cha issue c'mon 
 The good book say, he who is without sin cast the first stone 
 Man every time I walk in the church house 
 The preacher cuttin' his eyes at me 
 For that though, he can't throw nothin' my way 
 He dirtier than I am 
 Ridin' down the street shinin', ballin' 
 Hollerin' at broads, hollerin' dudes on the cool 
 That's why niggas don't go to church now 
 It ain't the message it's the motherfuckin' messenger, 
 Let us move on 
 Hey Mr. Policeman what do you say 
 I see you out here tryin' to save yourself some people today 
 You got the knight stick in your and the walkin' your beat 
 Or in the blue and white car drivin' down my street 
 You say you hear to help the people and do us some good 
 Protect and serve and try to keep some peace in the hood 
 Claim you crackin' down on the crime but lets keep it true 
 Cause the biggest criminals in my city is you 
 You know police brutality is at a all tiem high 
 Pumpin' 61 slugs into an unarmed guy 
 Try to say that he was sellin', had a motherfuckin' hand gun 
 When you couldn't find one, you motherfuckers plant one 
 Rampart scandal Tupac Shakur Christopher Wallace, you got me sick 
 But who got the cure, 
 If the PD went M-I-A we wouldn't miss you, 
 You some dirty motherfuckers and its time to get cha issue c'mon 
 Look at this shit manj 
 I'ma do dewalla, Sean Bell, Tupac Shakur, Notorious B.I.G 
 Motherfuckers is dying out here man 
 And if the poilice ain't killin' 'em 
 They don't give a fuck about the weak, 
 Nobody tryin' to figure out who killed these people 
 Fat Pack, Big Hawk, the shit ain't right man' 
 Good cop, bad cop, the line blurring everyday, let us move on 
 Hey Mr. Politician what do you say? 
 I see yourself tryin' to save some people today 
 You tellin' us its time for a change people is dying 
 And the current administration is doing nothing but lying 
 You come down to my community and tell us your goals 
 To clean the system up and get the crisis under control 
 Claiming you get us on track but lets keep it true 
 The man motherfuckers keepin' us off track is you 
 Damn near everybody runnin' is a member of the senate 
 And voted to send us to war, so y'all gotta send it 
 Now the shit done hit the fan and now you tryin' to say 
 You wasn't down from the jump, man this shit wont play 
 Y'all some liars, stealer's, vallanderers and all 
 Got senate to suck your dick inside the bathroom stalls 
 Now elected officials lettin the dick kiss you 
 You's a dirty motherfucker so its time to get cha issue c'mon 
 Man I don't believe this shit 
 Motherfuckers overseas dying in that war, 
 We just got rid of a prison and 
 Now he just wanna sit back and get his dick suck all damn day 
 Now we got motherfuckin' elected people in office 
 In airport bathrooms suck dick, 
 Tappin' people on they feet and shit 
 Man what's this world comin' to, who lookin' out for the children 
 Education, social security, bring out people back from motherfuckin' Iraq man 
 For real let us move on
