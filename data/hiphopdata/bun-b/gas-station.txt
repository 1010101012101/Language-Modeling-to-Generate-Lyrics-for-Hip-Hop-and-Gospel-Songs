So certified USDA brand dude from PA man 
 This UGK and I'm rockin' my Ray-Bans mirror lens tinted up 
 Servin' these boys so place your orders out 
 Send'em up 
 Blue plate special with the blue paint drippin' 
 Carolina blue j's on my feet 
 And I ain't trippin' dippin' one deep 
 Fuck it two matter fact quatro me chuck mikey and once he left out four 
 Sweet james jones grippin' sweet grain holmes 
 It's a bumpy ride ahead so you best to hang on 
 We kamikaze style and we 'bout to get it gungho 
 84 go ritz on 84 the trunk is hung low 
 Fifth wheel trickin' got the boppers in my sight 
 I bust a u-y at the intersection catch'em at the light, 
 Yo what's cracking for tonight? 
 'Cause if you ain't got a plan I got a man and we could hook up something tight just make a right into the gas station.

 I got my hands full 
 The full force force and d's 
 Trumps in the tape player 
 88 cutlass supreme 
 With 6 grade tables all eyes on me 
 Nas used that same beat when he spit street dreams 
 My mom drove a coursica we was in the back seat 
 Looking out the window imagination real big dreams 
 I set a new standard for who felt like me 
 Demonstrator style wild flagrant fouls can't screen 
 Showing you the big picture the complete HD 
 DVR rewind it back you wouldn't believe 
 Said I bring that old thing back and they couldn't believe it 
 Airfares way more for a trip to Ibiza 
 The petrol is 5 bucks, I can't believe it 
 What the fuck is the deal? 
 We too dependent on that barrel 
 It's the way of the world 
 Keep shifting it's gears man 
 I gotta fill up, you want something from in here? 
 Throw it reverse for some shorty with the works 
 Write my number on some paper then throw it in her purse 
 As I ride by first things first 
 9 times out of the 10 that cool shit usually works 
 It's 70 degrees I'm in a short sleeve shirt 
 Without wearing a jacket put seeds in the earth 
 I'm growing money trees in my front yard 
 Let me water my lawn 
 I make it look so easy it hurts 
 Let me get my other dollar back 
 Know I have change cause the chicken wrap don't cost more than I gave fool 
 Man you can keep that buck and all my niggas in the range roves just keep trucking 
 Same picture in the frame so selling suede hats and the rain won't work but one try won't hurt me 
 Lucky number 10's and a rondo jersey 
 Be at the gas station you can get in the front seat
