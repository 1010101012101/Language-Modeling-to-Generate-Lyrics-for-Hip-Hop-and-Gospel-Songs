 'Cause country boys talk with a dirty mouth and they on them corners 
 And they hustlin' up that dirty D, better watch them dirty boys

 And I got that brown & I got that green when I'm in yo' town & I hit yo' scene 
 In a candy painted car that'll sit so clean 
 Trunk on pop with the 5th on lean 
 "II Trill" DVD playin' on my screen 
 Sittin' on cream. Man you know what I mean?

 Or we pullin' out them tecs, man I got them macs & I got them K's

 (Lupe Fiasco) 
 Yup! Now I'm Chi-Town born and I'm Chi-Town bred; call me Westside Lu' 
 But I know about the Northside blues and them Southside reds 
 I run the F-N-F crew till my man Chilly Chill come home and he back on deck 
 My garage keep a very fast car, keep a classy gold chain wrapped around my neck 
 I came from the left but I'm downright fresh 
 Speak on - how you on a song Bun B 
 Complete 180 how crazy-ass he gone 
 How strong is the brand of D that he on? 
 How come he do what he want and never do what we want? 
 I'm Rick James, in this game 
 There's a wide leather couch for me to plant my feet on 
 The Murphys didn't jump me, told me to get comfy 
 Even brought the loveseat for me to spill my drink on 
 Willie D gave me my stamp 
 Shout to Mike Jones and the Swisha camp 
 That boy Callion and the Rap-A-Lot Ranch 
 The "boss of the North" and "The People's Champ" 
 Coolest nigga what? Coolest nigga what? 
 Been swallowed by them city lights 
 Ball till I'm benched and I put it on a pimp 
 F-N-F, U-P, U-G-K fo' life 
 {I swang on 'em, swang on 'em} 
 {I swang on 'em, swang on 'em} 
 We ride, we ride 22's or better {Swang on 'em; I swang on 'em, swang on 'em} 
 We, we ride, we ride 22's or better {Swang on 'em; I swang on 'em, swang on 'em}
