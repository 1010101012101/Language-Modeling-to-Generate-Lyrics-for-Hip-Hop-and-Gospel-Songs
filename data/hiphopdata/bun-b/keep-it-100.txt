Keep it 1 
 Keep it 100 
 All day and all night 
 Nigga, anytime you see me, I?ma keep it Super Tight 
 I'm an underground king, reppin? UGK 
 They give a damn what a mother fucker say, I?ma keep it 100 
 All night and all day 
 Nigga, anytime you see me, mayne, I'm reppin? P.A. 
 This is UGK for life, long live, Pimp C 
 And I?ma never let a nigga pimp me, I?ma keep it 100 
 'Cause this all that I've ever known 
 All that I've ever been, all that I've ever shown 
 Get your shit together, clone, build a better prototype 
 You lookin' like a mop and I'm lookin' for a floor to wipe 
 I heard your album, mayne, if that's what you called it 
 Another Gangsta Fairytale and for that shit we ain't fallin'? 
 Oh you're talkin'?, body slangin?, bangin'?, bustin' and ballin? 
 But I ain't seen your scary ass at all star in New Orleans 
 (All star in New Orleans, nigga) 
 I'm tried mayne, this shit is gettin' older than Moses 
 Pussy niggas always prowlin? with poses 
 Look mayne, all it really shows is how hard you ain't 
 A nigga punch your ass to the mouth, you'd probably faint 
 Not from the power of the punch but the shock 
 'Cause you a coward and niggas gon? devour, you're lunch 
 A bunch of niggas done tried but ain't too many done it like me 
 It's Bun B, the UG and I?ma keep it 100 
 All day and all night 
 Nigga, anytime you see me, I?ma keep it Super Tight 
 I'm an underground king, reppin? UGK 
 They give a damn what a motherfucker says, I?ma keep it 100 
 All night and all day 
 Nigga, anytime you see me, mayne, I'm reppin? P.A. 
 This is UGK for life, long live, Pimp C 
 And I?ma never let a nigga pimp me, I?ma keep it 100 
 'Cause that's exactly what the Trill do 
 Ain't nobody tellin' me what I won't or I will do 
 If I don't feel you, you lucky that I don't kill you 
 Leave you leakin? till you're [Incomprehensible], for real dude 
 I got the skill to, don't make me have to show it 
 'Cause it'll be over before you know it 
 You get one shot and I suggest you don't blow it 
 If I do it, I only do it, reap it, you gon? sow it 
 (You reap it, you gon? sow it) 
 I'm a revolutionary black gangster 
 You fuckin' with fire, fuck around and get a blister 
 I fuck with a papa then fuck around and hit a sister 
 Underground king, motherfucker, call me mister 
 (Mister what?) 
 Kilogram, Mister Wood-grain, Mister Brick 
 And unless you the Missus get off the Mister Dick 
 'Cause this the shit that have these motherfuckers 
 Runin? for the hill from the king of the Trill 
 'Cause I keep it 100 
 All day and all night 
 Nigga, anytime you see me, I?ma keep it Super Tight

 'Cause now a days motherfuckers lie 
 Some to your face, some can't even look you in the eye 
 Some in this place, some just left and some just comin' by 
 A little later, probably a little hater 
 And they go through an? invade us, tryin' to prove their the greatest 
 And they still gon? be wronger than Bun, so holler later 
 I'm leavin'?, I'm not a waiter but I'll end up servin' you 
 They tryin' to step up to the likes of me, why, the nerve of you? 
 But lie? Never and I do declare 
 I'm 'bout to fuck the game up, so it's best you prepare 
 Pullin? on your beef 'cause I venom be spittin'? 
 Red hot fire, so you better bring mittens 
 But you a pussy and your partner is kittens 
 I'll do 'em and when I'm done they'll be like, ?No, he didn?t? 
 Get your toilet paper, nigga 'cause I'm gonna be shittin? 
 Now, you're really gon? hate us, with no quittin? 
 And I?ma keep it 100 
 All day and all night 
 Nigga, anytime you see me, I?ma keep it Super Tight
