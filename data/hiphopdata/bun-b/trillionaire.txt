(Chorus - T-Pain) 
 I know they hatin' on me, 'cause I'm the man 
 I'm too trill homie, I don't give a damn 
 I'm a self made trillionaire 
 I'm a self made trillionaire 
 From the underground to the top 
 I came from the bottom 
 Trill niggas don't stop 
 Let 'em goin' harder 
 Self made trillionaire 
 I'm a self made trillionaire 
 (Verse 1 - Bun B) 
 Ok, let's get this shit crackilatin' 
 No more procrastinatin' 
 They they told me Bun don't hesitate 
 Don't keep these bastards waitin' 
 I'm puttin' egos and chicken 
 I'm so e-musculatin' 
 People stop this dance 
 Say damn this niggas fascinatin' 
 We blowin' dro up in the air 
 You smell it? 
 That's the fragrance 
 I got the focus, got the heart 
 And I got the patience 
 You hatin' just get off my dick 
 Look like you want some gay shit 
 I'm tryina' take this to the mountain top 
 Appalachian 
 But it's a rocky road 
 And I'm still movin' up and make no movin' us 
 So keep that pushy get your movie bra 
 You might be new to me 
 But you know I ain't new to you 
 Go ask the white boy 
 They say he's totally tubula 
 Fuckin' bad bitches rub my dick against their uvula 
 Everytime I hit the streets 
 It's like a fuckin' movie bra 
 You know what I do to ya 
 Say glad you gave the studio 
 They gon' leave you chopped up 
 Like they was DJ Screwin' ya 
 (Verse 2 - Bun B) 
 Ok, let's get this shit poppin' off 
 From the go know I'm a boss 
 I don't fuck wit' lames 
 And do my dirt nigga wit' out a loss 
 I keeps it pimpin', flyest hoes come in and out the loft 
 When you get fettuccini you gon' need alotta sauce 
 I gets my Gucci on my baby likes alotta Prada 
 She goin' shoppin' till she drops 
 She knows den gotta gotta 
 But she not shotgun in the slab 
 Oh no I got a shotta 
 He keep that shotgun in the slab and roll wit' out natta 
 He keeps his eyes wide open, he's a hata spotta 
 And when they roll up on me wrong, then he's a hata droppa 
 And he don't mess around wit' niggas tryna play the poppa 
 He keep it gangsta nigga he gon' go and straight a choppa 
 'Cause I don't roll wit' fake people and I neva will 
 I represents the G-code till I see the steel 
 Don't make me have to draw down wit' that red appeal 
 Then you gon' undastand that Bun B is foreva trill 
 (Verse 3 - Bun B (T-Pain)) 
 (Oh, do you swear to keep it gangsta?) 
 Gangsta than a mothafucka, trill until I D I E 
 Fuck these otha suckas 
 (What's your message to them fake thugs?) 
 They throwin' rocks and hidin' hands 
 It don't really matta this the dirty South we ridin' man 
 (How long you been up on that trill shit?) 
 Since the day they made me 
 And from a baby until the day they neva play me 
 (Waa, throw ya hands up) 
 From P.A.T. to yo' town, ain't no need to slow down 
 Baby boy it's about to go down
