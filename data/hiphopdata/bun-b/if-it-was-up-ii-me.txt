I hear we livin' in the last days 
 Its revelation and you best get right with god 
 Or else is waitin', the world is comin' to an end 
 Everyday is a storm or a flood, tsunamis, this shit ain't the norm 
 We got Katrina and Rita minds keep collapsing 
 With the fires and mud slides, I'm like what's happenin' 
 Got the kids in the school gettin' raped and molested 
 Under-funded, unprotected no wonder they tested 
 And the lowest percentage rate, 
 In my city damn near the lowest in the state 
 You can equate that to the state funds 
 That ain't breakin' down right, 
 Rich districts get more and poor ones less, and it just don't sound right 
 So I'm fittin' to pound right on the doors of my city hall 
 And kick them doors down, they killin' my city y'all 
 We need to get my people back to where they should be 
 And since nobody else is gonna do it it's gonna have to be me 
 (Chorus: Junior Reid) 
 If it was up to me, 
 No gun, no crack, or whore could of comin' in our community 
 If it was up to me, 
 You couldn't have no war between Tupac and B.I.G 
 If it was up to me, 
 They couldn't lock up Shyne and they couldn't lock up Emcee 
 If it was up to me, 
 You wouldn't have no aids and you wouldn't have no H.I.V 
 First of all the projects is fucked up 
 And it ain't just with the drugs, 
 We got more problems than just the dealers and thugs 
 They using lead based paint, and investments is killing us 
 We tell 'em to fix it up but they just ain't feelin' us 
 They rather kicks us out and tear it down to the ground 
 So they can put up a parking lot, a mall, or some condos 
 Condemn the whole place 'cause if you sell crack 
 Shit the rest ain't do nothin' wrong, what the fucks up with that 
 They say one rotten apple can spoil the whole bunch 
 But we talkin' bout some people not apples, this ain't lunch 
 Make me wanna punch a politician dead in his face 
 You say you represent my district, get your ass on the case 
 Development is good for the hood yeah that's what you tellin' us 
 But bitch you on the pay roll of the builders and developers 
 Fuck what you sellin' us, pipe dreams for suckers 
 You can take that around the corner to them other motherfuckers man 
 So much youth they sacrifice 
 Just to live in paradise 
 Play they tricks and tell they lies I know 
 Its hurting to see how they treat the poor 
 They have so much and still they still want more 
 I see my people everyday on the floor 
 Its time to educate the people man, free school and college 
 So everybody cross the border can get the same knowledge 
 Education leads to jobs and jobs kill poverty 
 And no more poverty means we makin' money obviously 
 Everybody makin' money everybody smilin' 
 Motherfuckers ain't eatin', them motherfuckers wildin' 
 Matter fact speakin' of eatin' lets feed the homeless in America 
 Let these motherfuckers handle their own shit 
 How am I gonna clean your house, and mine still dirty 
 How am I gonna feed your kids, and mine still thirsty 
 And speakin' of the kids we need to spend some more time with 'em 
 Can't turn 'em loose in the streets, 'cause they dying in 'em 
 And all this naked ass sex man you trippin', fuck love 
 I'm livin' life you ain't gonna catch your boy slippin' 
 You say your boy trippin', I'm just keepin' in it G 
 Cause you could see how good the world would be if it was up to me 
 So much youth they sacrifice 
 Just to live in paradise 
 Play they tricks and tell they lies I know
