(Chorus: Gucci Mane (Lil Scrappy): x2) 
 I rob in my black tee 
 Hit licks in my black tee 
 All in ya house searching for bricks in my black tee (Crank It) 
 I kill in my black tee 
 I steal in my black tee 
 I'm real so I gotta keep it trill in my black tee 
 (Verse 1: Gucci Mane) 
 You can catch me all in a nigga house wit a black tee 
 Gucci Mane, lil' flair got a million dollar mouthpiece 
 Black Tee, black rag, even got a black mask 
 Leaving out ya house, thirty pounds in my book bag 
 Black 'lac, black tag, fin' to hit a lick again 
 You a head bussa put yo hand wit yo fist den 
 Franchise hate me, probably wanna kill me 
 Remixed it wit Scrappy and now the hood feel me 
 Fresh on the scene wit the all black shirt 
 Gucci so gutter he'll steal money out ya purse 
 Lay up in ya yard, rob ya when ya go to church 
 Ya love white tees now ya face on the shirt 
 Black tee, black beat, trapping on the front street 
 Got a black pistol grip pump on the seat 
 Black tee, O.G., nigga don't approach me 
 Bubble gum wappin' ass niggas can't smoke me 
 (Verse 2: Bun B) 
 It's Bun B in his black tee & G in his black tee 
 Repping UGK and BAT in his black tee 
 Pimp in his black tee, mack in his black tee 
 Free Pimp C on the back of his black tee 
 Gucci chain swinging on the front of his black tee 
 Cadillac swinging, smoking blunts in his black tee 
 Stunt in his black tee, Ball in his black tee 
 It ain't just me pimping we all got a black tee 
 (Verse 3: Young Jeezy) 
 And I got a 1-2 Bun 
 Got 36 O's for the 2-1 
 Jeezy 'bout them green guys 
 Got H-town going for the ten or fives 
 I'm talking cornflakes 
 Black inner tubes wrapped in black duck tape 
 Say it again dog to make sure that you heard me 
 Got my four-x black tee up under my jersey 
 (Verse 4: Killer Mike) 
 I got the all black Chevy on all black rims 
 Keep a small black gat in my all black Tims 
 On the all-black leather there's a all-black mack 
 Trying to snatch get ya black ass blowed the fuck back 
 44 to ya torso 4 in ya hat 
 Kick doja to ya house 'n' put it to a cataract 
 Gorillas wit banana clips going monkey in the back 
 They'll put yo ass in that black box, laid out flat 
 (Verse 5: Jody Breeze) 
 Look I slang in my white but I bang in my black tee 
 Gucci on the front, Jody Breeze on the back street 
 Chilling by a black Cadillac on sum black feet 
 Scrappy in a Chevy watching Scarface on the flat screen 
 Told y'all constantly, ride wit the pump wit me 
 Yup in my black tee, wit the nine underneath 
 I ain't gotta keep telling y'all niggas I'ma G 
 I'ma just cock back and leave sum blood on ya teeth 
 (Verse 6: 4-Tre) 
 I'm s-stainless in my black tee 
 Remaining in my black tee 
 On the grind 'cause I like to shine in my black tee 
 Diamond glistening cross plus the background is a black tee 
 Thieve then come back spraying rounds in my black tee 
 4-Tre, I want war in my black tee 
 Fuck them, probably never wore a black tee 
 Working in my black tee, smoking purple in my black tee 
 I'm looking for twelve all out yo curtain in my black tee 
 (Verse 7: Lil Scrappy) 
 Fuck a white tee, I got my black tee and vest on 
 Fuck a sturdy shot, I'm going straight for the bread home 
 I don't know why y'all niggas dropped move b 
 Cause now Raheem'll show ya punk ass a tree 
 Bust nuts in my black tee, sluts in my black tee 
 Now I'm smoking nothing but blunts in my black tee 
 Saw me in Valve then tried to fight me 
 Just the same monkey shorty don't take me lightly
