 It ain't no joke up in here, got so much smoke up in here 
 That you'll probably choke up in here, if you ain't on that dope up in here 
 Mayne I should slow up in here, 'cause I can't get roped up in here 
 Got this lil' hoe up in here and I ain't had insurance in years 
 But I'll turn the wheels, the music fuck up your ears 
 Snatch some mo twenty-sixes, give you mo shit to go whisper 
 I have 'em big, by the line-you clip 'em one at a time 
 You do this shit by the month, I switch 'em up by the blunt 
 So don't be stuntin', respect that chickens and boppas be on me 
 And Yeah I'm probably in the projects with some lil'niggas that's wanted 
 In the whip with some tint, bad bitch with some sense 
 I get tired of ridin' this, I hit the castle and switch 
 Yeah my lil' homie done came up on some extravagant shit 
 So I roll it up and took me an extravagant hit 
 Got to laughin' and grinnin', man it must be Bleezy 
 Started trippin' and cheesin', I rolled another one, immediate you know I'm...

 I be creepin' slowly in the Monte Carlo 
 I ain't goin' inside till tomorrow 
 I gotta get it, give a fuck if it's your car note 
 Black Jeep behind me that's my nigga Marlo 
 I pull up at the studio, I'm gettin' blunted 
 With a stripper, Boosie call her Young Dummy 
 My girl hit me, Phat bring yo ass home 
 Not right now 'cause I'm gettin' my thug on 
 Eyes low, Yeah I'm smokin' off the pound 
 Hat back, seats low-me and my round 
 4-4 in my pack it's kind of heavy 
 Take it off, put it on my lap-I stay ready 
 This shit garbage man I'm tired of smokin' this 
 Hit my nigga B to get some different shit 
 Motherfucker and don't never think I'm scary 
 I put hollow tips through your fuckin' belly 
 They goin' burn ya like a deli, I stay ready

 Mayne I'm always in the ghetto, in the ghetto you can find me 
 Cadillac swangin' car killas right behind me 
 Rollin' down the interstate doin' bout ninety 
 The car so smoked out this shit is about to blind me 
 Gotta crack the window and let loose the smog 
 While I'm bendin' corners in my candy painted hog 
 This sweet is so impact, this motherfuckers like a log 
 I take another hit and then I pass it to my dog 
 A doe, doe smokin' gangsta, I stay twistin' that green 
 A twenty eight gram a day habit, know what I mean 
 If I don't get medicine nigga on the cool 
 I'm bout to start trippin' out-actin' a mothafucking fool 
 That's when Dr.Jekyll turn into Hyde on these boys 
 And pull out the hecklar and start to ride on these boys 
 Where I'm from we ain't lettin' shit slide on these boys 
 But we goin' keep our pistols and our eyes on these boys, that's What's up
