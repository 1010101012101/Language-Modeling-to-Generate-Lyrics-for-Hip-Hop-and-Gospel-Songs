(Feat. Lyfe Jennings, Young Buck) 
 (Chorus: Lyfe Jennings] [x2) 
 Oh, If I nigga Die II Night 
 Make sure I didn't die in vain and they feel my pain 
 Make sure my niggas ride for me 
 Or comin' up on the side of me, side of me. 
 Bun B: 
 Man I'm a real Trill nigga (nigga) I been out on them blocks 
 With them hustlers (hustlers) them dealers (dealers) & killers sellin' rocks 
 Put in work in round the clock from when the sun went down 
 Till it came back up and night came back around (around) 
 I did alot of shit them late nights for the dough 
 Robbin' niggas on the low (low) laughed at 'em then I go (go) 
 Sometimes it went smooth and nobody got hurt 
 And sometimes I had to leave a nigga's dick up in the dirt 
 I ain't proud of what I did and if I could go back in time (time) 
 I'd try to find another way instead of packin' 9's 
 Totin' K's & holdin' mac's (mac's) 
 But we know time ain't rollin' back 
 And hungry hyenas, they ain't foldin' jack 
 So on these cold and black streets, wolves keep huntin' 
 And a young black man can lose his life over nothin' 
 If I gotta go, please let it be for somethin' real 
 'Cause this bullshit hood shit is gettin' niggas killed on the real. 
 (Chorus: Lyfe Jennings] [x2) 
 Oh, If I nigga Die II Night 
 Make sure I didn't die in vain and they feel my pain 
 Make sure my niggas ride for me 
 Or comin' up on the side of me, side of me. 
 Bun B: 
 Well if a deal goes dirty or the counts don't match (match) 
 Or if I catch a muthafucker dippin' in the back (dippin' in the back) 
 Say if a nigga disrespect me or my fam 
 And we take it to the streets and let the guns go blam 
 I don't really give a damn (damn) or really know whatever's gon' come (come) 
 And I'm a represent where I'm from (represent where I'm from) 
 Man I don't wanna die (die) but I ain't scared to (I ain't scared to) 
 Shit, I just wanna make sure that I'm prepared to (I'm prepared to) 
 Can't leave without a couple tickets in the stands 
 So my wife and my mama and my chil'ren got cans (chil'ren got cans) 
 'Cause once I'm gone who gon' take care of my kids? (take care of my kids) 
 And do the same things for 'em that I did 
 Man I'd rather do a bid (bid) 
 At the least they can see me behind the glass (glass) 
 Instead I'm reminiscin' 'about the past (about the past) 
 Nigga don't know what he got, until he passes on 
 So let him tell 'em that he love 'em 'fore his ass is gone. 
 (Chorus: Lyfe Jennings) 
 If I nigga Die II Night 
 Make sure I didn't die in vain and they feel my pain 
 Make sure my niggas ride for me 
 Or comin' up on the side of me, side of me. 
 (Chorus: Lyfe Jennings) 
 Oh, If I nigga Die II Night 
 Make sure I didn't die in vain and they feel my pain 
 Make sure my niggas ride for me 
 Or comin' up on the side of me, side of me. 
 Young Buck: 
 We trappin' hard right across from the graveyard 
 I just pray to God I don't have to work a day job 
 Niggas gettin' robbed so I'm ridin' with my A R 
 They are, not sendin' tape what I done paid for (no) 
 Walkin' through the bricks on my Jena 6 shit 
 Like if you ain't from around here, you was gettin' hit (come on) 
 Send a O.G. some flicks, make they time go by quick (hey) 
 You surprised what some pictures in the penitentiary did (yeah) 
 We survived but most of us die for some bullshit 
 Go to church but the devil's standin' on the pulpit (damn) 
 Niggas lied just to kick it (what?) swear to God they got a meal ticket 
 Then they call you and they 'about to get evicted (I know) 
 A Underground King, I've been one ever since I was 16 (come on) 
 Pimp and Bun'll tell you just what Buck mean (what's up?) 
 A street nigga livin' the street dream, I seen (for sho') 
 My whole team go to the feds or get a hole in the head 
 This what I said, yeah. 
 (Chorus: Lyfe Jennings) 
 If I nigga Die II Night 
 Make sure I didn't die in vain and they feel my pain 
 Make sure my niggas ride for me 
 Or comin' up on the side of me, side of me. 
 (Chorus: Lyfe Jennings) 
 Oh, If I nigga Die II Night 
 Make sure I didn't die in vain and they feel my pain 
 Make sure my niggas ride for me
