Justice league... 
 She a dime piece top flight brand 
 She thick and she stylish and she tight man 
 And everynight man when the lights low 
 She good man high pro nitro 
 Always give me what I desire 
 All night long never get tired 
 It's that fire it's that flame 
 Hit that one time you'll never be the same 
 It's the tiger you can't tame 
 And if you get bitched you got nobody to blame 
 She know I gotta get back to my stack 
 But when I try to leave shell be callin me back 
 You know I gotta get on my grind 
 I don't play with my money or my time 
 She know I gotta get back to the bread 
 But when every time I try to leave baby sad 
 You know I gotta leave can't stay 
 You know I'm coming back another day 
 I gotta get back to stacking cheese 
 But when I try to go baby said please 
 She said she hate when I'm not home 
 It's like every other day man in gone 
 Chasing out cheddar tryin' to get paid 
 But she rather have me home tryin' to get laid 
 She keep a good real house 
 She can cook she can clean no doubt 
 She keep herself looking good 
 And the engine gonna purr if I check under the hood 
 Under the hood wish I could she know I can't 
 She begging me to stay but she know I ain't 
 She know I gotta get back to my stack 
 But when I try to leave shell be callin me back 
 You know I gotta get on my grind 
 I don't play with my money or my time 
 She know I gotta get back to the bread 
 But when every time I try to leave baby sad 
 You know I gotta leave can't stay 
 You know I'm coming back another day 
 I gotta get back to stacking cheese 
 But when I try to go baby said please 
 Now she blocking off the exit 
 She tryin' to have my keys and my necklace 
 Telling me to come sex this acting all reckless 
 Girl you on some next shit 
 Getting hotter than a candle lit 
 I don't know if I can handle it 
 Babygirl so scandelous 
 She come any closer I might have to dismantle it 
 Mantle it beat it out the frame for her 
 The bed hotter than a flamethrower 
 She know I gotta get back to my stack 
 But when I try to leave shell be callin me back 
 You know I gotta get on my grind 
 I don't play with my money or my time 
 She know I gotta get back to the bread 
 But when every time I try to leave baby sad 
 You know I gotta leave can't stay 
 You know I'm coming back another day 
 I gotta get back to stacking cheese 
 But when I try to go baby said please
