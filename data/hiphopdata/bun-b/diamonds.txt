Diamonds in my piece of chain 
 Diamonds in my piece of 
 Diamond diamonds in my piece of chain 
 Diamonds in my piece of 
 Diamonds diamonds in my piece of chain 
 Diamonds in my piece of 
 Diamond diamonds in my piece of chain 
 Diamonds in my piece of chain 
 (Lil Jon) 
 Yeah 
 This shit right here (what's up) 
 For all my niggas in the south (OK) 
 Making big dough (know what I'm talking bout) 
 Making big long dollars 
 All my niggas in H-Town 
 New Orleans, Dallas Texas 
 Mississippi All over the south 
 Shit of course the ATL (All over the south) 
 All my niggas rocking those diamonds and pieces in there chains 
 (Mjg) 
 Now we done talked about the pinky ring 
 And talked about the gold grill 
 So tell me 
 What's left to give really yo spine a cold chill 
 We call some call 'em diamonds 
 We call 'em ice 
 It varies in the sizes the shape 
 The color and the price 
 From canary yellow, ruby red to baby blue 
 One stone or maybe two 
 Fuck it 'cause we all can't be babies fool 
 Some of its jazzy 
 Some of it can't be real 
 Nigga say its sitting platinum 
 Knowing its stainless steel shit 
 I seen all kinds of medallions 
 On the necks of rappers 
 Drug dealers, Marks, ball players and stallions 
 ? Shit they buy them hoes by the dozen 
 O.G. nigga get a new piece 
 Pass the old down to his cousin 
 Spell out your name, your corner, your clique 
 I know a pimp that got a piece with a bitch sucking his dick 
 So what you waiting for you shy men? 
 Come join the fly men 
 That'll push like hymens for (diamonds) 
 With perfect timing 
 (Bun B.) 
 Some folks'll kill to have a real diamond 
 You get some grade A rocks and in 20years they still shining 
 No need to worry, women will find em 
 But if they gaze at yo carrots for to long it will blind em 
 Cubic Zirconia helped the whole hood fine 
 Now that everybody can bling we having good times 
 I'm writing clever rhymes feeling like forever grinding 
 A diamond in the rough 
 Buff me up and hear me shine 
 I used to hit these streets and slang 
 Hustling in these peoples game 
 Now its just for piece 'n' thang 
 I ain't tryin' to preach you man 
 I ain't tryin' to heat your flame 
 I just wanna teach your brain 
 I'm so full of flavor I'm give some to the weak and blang 
 M-J- fucking G 
 Touch me I'm in reaching range 
 Lets hit the beach and hang 
 For pimping I'll be the blame 
 A ? dropping this knowledge will help me explain 
 About my Diamonds, my pimping and my piece of chain 
 (Chorus (2xs)) 
 (Lil Jon) 
 Yeah Yeah 
 Yeah 
 Bitch I'm coming down 
 Coming down tough 
 Bitch I'm coming down with them diamonds I'm my cup 
 I'm shining so hard 
 My pinky ring done 
 Ruby in the middle 
 Got yo baby mama frozen 
 25 carrots in the BME piece 
 To many carrots in my mother fucking teeth 
 In my chain 
 Them things 
 Big like boulders 
 My rocks cutting up like Taliban soldier 
 (Big Sam) 
 Cause down in the dirty it ain't no drama or no beef 
 It's all about them diamonds in yo piece I guarantee 
 Man I know a nigga wit a mouth full of gold 
 On the top he had the south 
 And on the bottom like wha 
 Big Sam with 36 off in my chain 
 4? off in my wood a woodgrain 
 And my piece I'm bout to precious cut them things 
 With 200 thousand to make that hoe blang blang
