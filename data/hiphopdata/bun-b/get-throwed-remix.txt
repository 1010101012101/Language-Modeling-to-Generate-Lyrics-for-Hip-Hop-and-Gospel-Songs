 (Pimp C) 
 Pimp C P.A. Trill nigga 
 Polo fuck that Hilfiger 
 Made myself a ghetto star 
 On the slab, sippin barre 
 Smokin' weed, sellin white 
 Them other niggaz shit don't come back right 
 That's how niggaz get popped 
 Trying to get the cheaper price 
 Watch yo' paper, guard your life 
 Cause most these niggaz ain't livin' right 
 Keep yo' pistol, fuck a fight 
 Cause niggaz out here jack every night 
 I keep my mind on my money nigga fuck the fame 
 Big face hun'erds, keepin' the game 
 Hittin the corner in the candy thang 
 Sittin' on leather, grippin the grain 
 (Z-Ro) Good weed, good drink, big money, we 
 (Young Jeezy) AYE! 
 (Z-Ro) Rollin' in somethin' foreign, I'm leather grippin grain

 (Bun B) 
 Well I came in the door, I said it befo' 
 I never fuck a hoe without head no more 
 I never pull up in nuttin less than a four 
 And I smoke cigars, it ain't just for the show 
 I'm blessed from the do', and known for my stidile 
 I send a nigga baby mamma home with a smidile 
 You can have the bitch nigga, I ain't sending men out 
 Smoke weed and freestyle, no instrumental 
 Been out, lived through the wicked streets of P.A. 
 Motherfuck the judge, prosecutor and the DA 
 Head to the H, where the hoes will fuck three way 
 Two way, four way, anyway the Pro say 
 Never hear a hoe say no I won't, no I can't 
 Stop it and no I don't 
 Cause a bitch know that I might just explode 
 And slap her in the face with a pie a la mode 
 Cause a nigga gettin' throwed
