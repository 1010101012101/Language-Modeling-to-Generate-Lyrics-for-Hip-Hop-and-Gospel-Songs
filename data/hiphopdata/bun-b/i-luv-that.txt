I love that shit, I love that shit 
 I love that shit 
 It's goin' down like it always do, 
 I'm about to hit 'em front row, front door with the crew 
 I pull up to vallet in the '09 cedes, 
 And turn the heads of all the fly ladies, 
 I let the doors out, then let the doors up 
 Step out the car, now the whole world slows up, 
 I show up like a certified pro, 
 Lookin' like slow motion when I heads to the door, 
 I walk right pass the line to the rope 
 Everybody fall back to the motherfuckin' pole, 
 It's not even a question if I'm fittin' to bring the strap in, 
 They tried to pad me down but it ain't about to happen, 
 Head to the bar all eyes on B the, 
 From the haters and the fly mommacitas, 
 And trust me man when the club this thick 
 You ain't even gotta ask, I love this shit 
 The club is packed the bottles is poppin' 
 We make it rain when the models is boppin' 
 (I love that shit) 
 Ladies shakin' their backs 
 And all the players in the place is catchin' heart attacks 
 (I love that shit) 
 Hey yo DJ turn it up 
 (I love that shit) 
 You gotta B then lets burn it up 
 You know we do it B-I-G so come and holla at a player in the V-I-P 
 UGK we in the house fo sho 
 We bout to crank this thing up, yeah you already know 
 We in the club lookin' like new money 
 Put your stunner shades on cause the ice to sunny 
 Me and my partners posted up at the bar 
 And we bout to buy it out for the price of your car 
 All the ace of spades all the rosette 
 All the syrup and white patron OK 
 Sent it out ice buckets by the dozen 
 I pass 'em out to my dogs and my cousins 
 The whole club full of smoke and we buzzin' 
 Its goin' down and man you thought it wasn't 
 Movin' through the club like a Tonka line 
 See the baddest lil' mama legs long and fine 
 And she like I love your rope, is solid gold or hollow B 
 Ill tell you in the V.I.P mommy follow me 
 No party like a trill ass party 
 Cause a trill ass party don't stop 
 Ain't no shorty like a trill ass shorty 
 Cause a trill ass shorty goin' drop 
 Go drop it down low to the flow make it pop 
 I wanna watch you wobble show me what you got 
 Now goin' work that and twerk that 
 Now jiggle it around maybe jerk that 
 Now toot it up, and boot it up 
 I'm cocked and loaded, I'ma shoot it up 
 Now grind it, wind it 
 Now back it up while I get behind it 
 Now go ahead and do your thing girl 
 Let it loose, let it go, let it hang girl 
 Now shake what your momma gave you for daddy 
 And you can ride shotgun in the caddy
