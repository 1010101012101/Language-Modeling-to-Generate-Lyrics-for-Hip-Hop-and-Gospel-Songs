 I've been called a bad boyfriend, and even worse Ex 
 Told put God first and her next 
 She's the only girl, like Snow White or Smurfette 
 She's not, I am dating nobody, nobody's perfect 
 And there's no sure bets, just courage and first steps 
 We don't talk, got hang-ups and one-word texts 
 Lessons learned on hurt, discipline 
 And repair, still need a lot of work, like Michigan 
 State improves when my Pistons win 
 Or when I see my sis again 
 With some friends I call when I'm gettin' bent 
 Outta shape over, ... wait, fix that 
 Fit, but no six-pack, 
 'Cause I won't do sit-ups of give up Big Macs 
 With Shad, you always get a mixed bag 
 Sadness and joy, wins and mishaps 
 Healed wounds, and picked scabs 
 More ups and downs than a Six Flags 
 Music with a message I lacked after the click, don't... 
 I said, don't you go 
 You hate talking on the phone 
 You're too far, way too close to home 
 I said, don't you go 
 You hate talking on the phone 
 You're too far, way too close to home 
 She's so off the hook 
 But when I'm lettin' go of the telephone 
 She goes off the wall, like a hella old centerfold 
 Should've left the cell at home 
 We're breaking up, can't hear what she's saying, but I get the tone 
 Kna'mean? Nah, I've never known 
 Say you mean well, then how come I'm left alone 
 When I need help this female won't take my calls 
 It's like pool, and that's her cue to break my balls 
 The games we play, replay the same each day 
 Phone-tag, hide-and-seek with the P.D.A. 
 Off, I'm on course, like the PGA 
 Towards the deep sea cave 
 Where my treasure is kept 
 Buried like death in depths where I keep me safe 
 It's just like, ay, keep in touch 
 Not Close like Glenn, just close enough 
 But the attachment's still there, just never opened up 
 I said, don't you go 
 You hate talking on the phone 
 You're too far, way too close to home 
 I said, don't you go 
 You hate talking on the phone 
 You're too far, way too close to home 
 And the bill from my cell is high C-Notes, Wynton Marsalis 
 Man, why tellers gotta be so selfish, helpless 
 Ran outta luck, ran outta minutes on my solo, before I could finish 
 Don't end this while I'm roaming on the road 
 Dough low, woken up with a special ring like Frodo 
 I get the picture, don't upload the photo 
 I can see you, bold pixels in my mind load in slow-mo 
 T Lo on the mix, just switch to phono 
 Grown folks, we be pinnin' hopes but the phone's broke 
 Disconnected, just a second 
 I'm cuttin' out, T Lo, cut the records
