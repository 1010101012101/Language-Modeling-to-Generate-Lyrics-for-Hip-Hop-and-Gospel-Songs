We spend our lives searching, like scavengers finding a way 
 Understanding that light is a sign of the day 
 So we squint in the darkness in search of a glow 
 And falter in trying 
 In trials we grow 
 Our hearts they seem broken 
 Our legs they are weak 
 Our tongues are exhausted from trying to speak 
 'Cause sometimes they listen 
 But often they don't 
 We easily help 
 But more often we won't 
 Because we constructed the things that we want 
 Ghosts are desires 
 Desire to haunt 
 But our need as below so above 
 What we all want 
 Should look a little more 
 Like love
