When I'm writing I repeatedly edit words and rework tracks 
 I'll admit I'm like the raptors I got weak first drafts 
 So when I'm dropping a new flow 
 It's prolly not all that solid at first post you might call it Arujo 
 But ballers improve yo 
 And in the same way soon the tunes get better 
 And I polish a juno 
 Who knows... I might get acknowledged and kudos 
 It's cool though 
 Long as I keep rocking a few shows 
 Not to model some new clothes 
 Pocket that loot bro 
 I'm still trying to figure tax. Stocks, and the loopholes 
 Like where's the refund? We filed for 'em 
 Deducted from gross? Shouldn't that be taken off the net? 
 Like child porn 
 My smile's warn off but I ain't that pissed though 
 I still got cash and I don't lack distro 
 And if I didn't I wouldn't change to go bag fistfuls 
 Of cold green, homie I'm no black minstrel show 
 Shad just don't compromise... 
 In this life we just can't compromise 
 It's a fight but we just can't compromise 
 With our time we just can't compromise 
 With these rhymes yo I just can't compromise 
 We just don't compromise... 
 I'm feeling like the people's champ 
 See my fans greet 
 A brother with hugs laughs and daps 
 They don't yell like banshees 
 Or stampede 
 Women ain't gotta dress fancy for the man 
 Please my listeners understand me 
 My fight to about this right 
 What this stand means 
 It's more than some grand schemes 
 To hold up a grammy 
 We fighting in a war that we can't see 
 My brothers and sisters in this struggle 
 There's no fans we family 
 Same root and branch tree 
 Listen I'm amped 
 Keep your hearts warm? 
 Mines on fire and I'm antsy 
 I know it's so cliche but I'm angry that some can't eat 
 Meanwhile I'm letting a damn feast of pastas and canned meats 
 Rot in my pantry 
 Like lord please can we speak on this frankly 
 Like God why you letting this happen? 
 Amen, he answered, son I'm askin you the same thing 
 'Cause you're supposed to be my servants 
 Out here working 
 Like you're my hands reaching out to those that's hurtin' 
 You don't have long on this earth
