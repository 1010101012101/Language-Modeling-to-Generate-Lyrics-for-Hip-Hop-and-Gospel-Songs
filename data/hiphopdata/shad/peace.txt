What if we can't be this perfect genius? 
 Thesis, Dean's list, virgin Jesus shirt and clean crisp 
 Jeans fitted and all straight from the seamstress 
 Seamless persons, we all fall to pieces 
 What if peace is something more than appeasement? 
 If Power rules the world, living peacefully is treason 
 Defenseless, defeating the legions of demons 
 Peace isn't pleasing the people 
 It's a belief in people above profits 
 Prophets who speak for peace 
 More often than not reap their fair share of the beatings 
 It's not naïve in the least 
 It's hard fought in the deepest thought 
 In the peak of our reason 
 It's Peace 
 Just another young lyricist 
 Spitting that unserious 
 It's clear that conscious rap is dead 
 We done hearing it 
 Heads feeling that trap 'cause we trap still 
 Trapping all these stats still 
 Rap about how blacks kill black 
 Cause no one wants to hear those facts still 
 That's so 90's that's said in the facts still 
 No paper and that real 
 No paper in that mill 
 Half mil plus locked up 
 Who want to listen to that? Chill 
 All we want is peace 
 The poor and the rich 
 From the beaches to the streets 
 So we'd rather hear beats than the sound of the beast 
 Now these comics is prophets 
 See the clown as he weeps 
 Crack jokes, crack eggs for a feast 
 Got a soft scramble, gotta beat em' just to eat 
 And it's not taught, which teaches us to repeat 
 The strong cycle of violence now it's harder than peace 
 It's not naïve in the least 
 Its hard fought it's the deepest thought 
 And the one thing that we seek 
 It's not just talk, when we meet 
 When we greet, when we grieve 
 When we leave, last word we speak
