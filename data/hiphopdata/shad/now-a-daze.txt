I'm focused on trying to stay focused 
 In '06 I dealt with some blows now the process 
 Of sorting through these ghosts feels hopeless 
 It's bogus but it still get under the skin like osmosis 
 Yo this world's so sick 
 Like Ne-yo's hit or folks with no OHIP 
 Don't slip 
 Know who the staff you roll with is 
 Your staff can turn to snakes like Moses' 
 And motives get exposed quick 
 When cash is grossed so don't trip 
 No sum is worth what your soul is 
 No sun immersed in the coldness 
 No son, reverse like the poles 
 Get past the bitterness out the standstill 
 It wasn't in the cards 
 Some people can't deal 
 Play the hand you're dealt 
 Might make a grand still 
 A man's real if he can return like Grant Hill 
 Those that know Shad know that hes on his own path 
 Like a nomad rolling without a road map 
 Just 4 lads in a topaz with no gas 
 I call my car Roc-a-fella 'cause it's got a broke dash 
 My generation's movin' so fast 
 Runnin' like old taps 
 From fear and stress and tears choked back 
 Boys hold gats while the girls got no strap 
 On their dresses and won't eat 'less it's low-fat 
 Between low-cut tops and teeth with gold caps 
 That new school looks more crazy than OCAD's 
 When there's no dads to say don't show that 
 Make 'em look in your eyes, your mind's where the show's at 
 And you need more than beats for a dope track 
 Even with more hooks than a coat rack 
 And more hot lines than 1-800 phones 
 That's why most cats in this rap game just don't last 
 It's not vocab they need to grow it's gonads 
 And back bone so they can speak and not hold back 
 We need folks with faith that's gon' last 
 To teach the younger ones how to live with no mask 
 And pose the kind of questions that most just won't ask 
 And keep that hope stashed like a safe of cold cash 
 Our vision for the future can't fade or go black 
 Like some Kodak pictures at night with no flash 
 Them cats be pollutin' the air like smoke stacks 
 Let the freshness in get your windows cracked
