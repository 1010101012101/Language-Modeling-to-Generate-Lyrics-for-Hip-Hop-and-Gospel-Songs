Though I empathize with em 
 And sympathize with em 
 (x4) 
 Though I empathize with em 
 And sympathize with em 
 I don't enterprise with em 
 Or synchronize with em 
 We don't strategize with em 
 We're not allies with em 
 We don't fratenize with em 
 Let 'em patronize 
 We don't want no ties with em 
 Wont monopolize with em 
 Let 'em ostracize 
 We don't 
 Compromise with em 
 We wont victimize with em 
 Commit genocide with em 
 Spit their lies with em 
 Or objectify women with em 
 Socialize with em 
 Broke my ties with em 
 Now we open-eyed in this over-hyped system 
 We know... 
 This wisdom of man 
 Is foolishness to God 
 Don't build on the sand 
 Or trust in the odds 
 Be shrewd as the snakes 
 And innocent as doves 
 Don't succumb to hate 
 Overcome hate with love 
 (x2) 
 We're taught not to question the status 
 Quo 'cause the masses never get heard 
 That's unless your established 
 With expert professors in dress-shirts 
 And glasses that lecture to classes 
 From lecterns 
 Where next term the best third will pass an' 
 Earn cash working as 
 Desk clerks for the best firms in manhattan 
 Where the pressure can crack em 
 'Cause networks and net worth and class get 
 Treasured over pleasures that last 
 Always measuring stacks 
 A passion for lesser 
 God's growing, see - the distraction is clever 
 But trust 
 Though I empathize with em 
 And sympathize with em 
 I don't enterprise with em 
 Or synchronize with em 
 We don't strategize with em 
 We're not allies with em 
 We don't fratenize with em 
 Let 'em patronize 
 We don't want no ties with em 
 Wont monopolize with em 
 Let 'em ostracize 
 We don't 
 Compromise with em 
 We wont victimize with em 
 Commit genocide with em 
 Spit their lies with em 
 Or objectify women with em 
 Socialize with em 
 Broke my ties with em 
 Now we open-eyed in this over-hyped system 
 We see...
