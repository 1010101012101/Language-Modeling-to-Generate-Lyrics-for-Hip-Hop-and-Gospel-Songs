Yo 
 Big ups to 91.5 live from cold K-dub 
 Just reminding all my guys in the world to stay up 
 Never had to spray slugs so I don't play thug 
 Or try to fit with the killers like O.J.'s glove 
 Still cats love to see me like they own pay stubs 
 Out to create buzz 
 Know that S.K. can shake clubs 
 Like car thieves or golfers 
 Crazy compulsive 
 Cold killer so ill 
 I'm giving competition ulcers 
 These fierce frenetic poetics pierce the pathetic, plagues 
 My powerful prophetic phonetics penetrate 
 This renegade relic raps rugged and demonstrates 
 How to scoop honeys with nothing but that angelic face 
 Aesthetic-based waste get shredded, I set it straight 
 For the hapless half-wit homies that hesitate 
 The hellagreat, elevated skills you celebrate 
 Practice? Kid I've been this ill since seventh-grade 
 I dedicate this to my sis and the crew 
 And thanks for coming out but the competition is through 
 I gets down 
 You suckas and frauds with soft stamina don't trouble me 
 Duck or I'll damage ya on camera publicly 
 When I utter these subtleties 
 Brother please 
 I'm the biggest thing out of Canada since Pamela's double-D's 
 Colleagues and critics all apply the accolades 
 To aptly describe how my flyness fascinates 
 I activate the part of me 
 That advocates the artistry 
 The slick, sharp tongue 
 That could lacerate an artery 
 Like an axe to the heart 
 Hackin' apart cats lackin' the smarts 
 'Cause I've mastered the art 
 I synchronize my syndicate 
 For rhyme syncopation 
 Even skits that I improvise 
 Sit in syndication 
 Let my sinful syntax and simple grin flash 
 'Cause dimes fall victim when my dimples impact 
 Cats listen close for quotes or vibe to it 
 I school dudes and make guys students of my music 
 The dumb sound dopest with their mic lines muted 
 While my I.Q. is so high you couldn't fly to it 
 I get down 
 My language is used 
 To bruise and stick damages to 
 Other bands and their crews 
 Till all their slick managers do 
 Is just bandage their wounds 
 This man is just too sick for Canada's amateurs 
 I make 'em dudes do flips like coin tosses 
 When I rip mics like loin clothes 
 Stripped off a groin 
 Join the clique or get going 
 Kid you're showing softness 
 I cross kids like Hot Sauce does 
 While impostors talk and jock like Bob Costas 
 This colossus is so pompous it's preposterous 
 I'm always jamming like Peter Tosh's rastas 
 Getting the thoughtless tossed quicker 
 Than The Moffats in a mosh pit, homes 
 I gets down like acrostic poems 
 My resources hold more forces 
 Than the torque on 400-horse Porsches 
 I contort, twist and torch kids 
 With my oral orifice 
 Till these dorks is nothing more than some scorched corpses 
 I get down 
 Yo, I get down 
 It's like I'm squeezing a glock 
 When I creep in the spot 
 People get shot back 
 Freeze and then flop, breathe and then stop 
 The way I leave 'em in shock 
 Forget radio they play my flow on "Believe It or Not!" 
 But I still don't own the keys to the drop 
 Leasin' to cop the beach with the yacht and don't foresee reaching the top 
 But that's cool 'cause I'm frequently jocked from speaking this talk 
 And plus on the streets I get props 
 Well before I leave, peace to the blocks 
 Where my people still beef with the cops 
 And get beaten a lot, it needs to get taught 
 And ask Kanye, Jesus can walk 
 Always reach for the Roc, not the heat to get cocked 
 Releasing the shot, ending a life 
 No need for the pop 
 Ya heard? Like sheep with the flock 
 I get down 
 I get down 
 I get down 
 And yo, Peace to Digs that's how I get down and yo, 
 Peace to Vee that's how I get down and yo, 
 And to the fam that's how I get down and yo
