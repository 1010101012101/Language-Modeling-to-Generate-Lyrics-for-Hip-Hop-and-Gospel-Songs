On the subject of subjects... 
 I learned geography is destiny and history is faith 
 Artists tasting the science of escape 
 Learned some five percent of math 
 Learned girls love drama class and home economics taught me class is about cake 
 That's why leaders of the States say wait 
 When the homeless don't eat we got a lot on our plate 
 While the kids in class wait with the weight a world 
 That's obsessed with the weight of a girl give her a break 
 And that dating game's chess still checkin' for a mate 
 But what they say is hard for a pimp is harder for a man of faith 
 Placed in an incubator full of hot babes 
 Heaven give me Grace like Will 'cause I'm not gay 
 Strong willed for so long did not date 
 Chill son I don't want a link give me Myspace 
 Like Tom now I'm tryna add a friend if she on the same page like my comments and Top 8 
 Beyonce material I'm writing spiritual raps to fight with these mask like Rey Mysterio 
 Hear both sides full stereo 
 World full of pain got us waiting on a miracle 
 Waiting on the world to change 
 When we should wait on the world like a waiter 
 Serve the world man this world is strange 
 Bizarro, lovers of tomorrow to break under the weight of the wonder and the sorrow
