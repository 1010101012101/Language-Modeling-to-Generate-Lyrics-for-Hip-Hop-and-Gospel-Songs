(Shadrach, Shadrach) 
 Say what you like, just spell my name right (I've got a good name) 
 Say what you like, just spell my name right (yeah) 
 Say what you like, just spell my name right (I represent more than my rap) 
 Say what you like, just spell my name right 
 I've got a good name, my first name came from slave in Babylon, back in the day, rat in a cage 
 Raised in chains, he trained like Rocky, but I mean his brain not boxing 
 So he got sly like Stallone, got game like 50 cent posse, up first to work on his coffee grind 
 In no time promoted to the king's right hand, but no hype man, had to take the right stand 
 When the king made a statue of gold he told the whole nation that they had to bow down to it 
 That or get tossed in the furnace Shad and his boys said boss you can burn us 
 We can't serve this statue it's worthless 
 The king was mad but Shadrach wasn't nervous 
 It must have been some strange phenomenon 
 They walked straight through the fire 
 Chaka Khan 
 Saved by faith stronger than flames, 
 If I'm half as brave then I honour my name 
 I've got a good name 
 And my last name, come down some generations 
 Came down from the elevation 
 High in the hills of a great nation 
 With a bright future and a dark past 
 That won't overshadow the hope cause the night's passed 
 Down from my grandfather who held down the village 
 Feel it when I touch down there 
 Now it's spilling in the same veins 
 As a good dad, with a good name 
 You see Shad's pop, always played bad cop 
 He had no badge though, we didn't give him mad props 
 But now I respect it 
 Guess it's perspective 
 In hindsight seeing it's corrective 
 So when I get kids if they get arrested 
 They going to get licks like breath mints 
 Check it 
 He held a tough job down 
 Held my mothers hand 
 Handed down proud roots from my motherland 
 To my hometown people say my name sounds dope no doubt but that's not why I'm most proud 
 I've got a good name
