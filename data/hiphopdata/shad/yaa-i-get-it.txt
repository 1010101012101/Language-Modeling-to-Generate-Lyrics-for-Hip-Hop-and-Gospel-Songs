I get it... 
 Maybe I'm not big 'cause I don't blog or Twitter 
 Dawg, I'm bitter 
 I didn't happen on the flop, but I'll win it on the river 
 Longest winter got me seasoned 
 Now I'm a non-beginner 
 Meanin' not yet a veteran but nevertheless 
 Pick the drug or the rapper man I'm better than meth 
 Dope as E though or Ether the drug or the Jay diss 
 I would say dope as reefer but that would be too basic 
 And overplayed, overslaved won't complain though 
 The games been good to a young'un outta London so I'm grateful 
 Not just for the fundin' or for the fans 
 But for the chance to say somethin', it wasn't in the plans at first 
 It was sad days, halfway to graduation 
 Cap and black cape making job applications 
 I hate the catch phrase "Canadian rap sensation" 
 Shad K don't have chains, big as the Appalachians 
 But since the label put me out like ash trays to smoke cats 
 I have gained some accolades and admiration 
 It's grown since then Though that second album man was so old-school 
 Folks called it old Princeton 
 I'm still penny pinchin it was so fine 
 My bills gonna hold still as pig skin 
 When its field goal time, now 
 That being said it's still 09 
 And I still got a lot of credit I still owe 9 
 But they charge no interest, so I pay no interest 
 Meaning I pay no mind, If there ain't no fine, I'm fine 
 I hope I ain't boring y'all rappin' bout rap 
 But the only thing I love more then rappin' is nappin 
 And I know nobody want to hear me rap about that 
 You want the underdog spazzin on the track 
 I get it... 
 Well my name ain't Lil' Wayne 
 Gretzky, But y'all know better than to check me 
 In the game, my whole record's like a technique 
 Telin' referees to peak at the press seats a sec please 
 DROP YOUR GLOVES OJ *haha* 
 I knock you into next week make you get teeth replaced 
 Can't use plates what you get to eat 
 Gives new meaning to tube steak 
 Like watching you breast feed doomsday 
 Move on these squares like a chess piece, I'm deadly 
 Even if you're Supernatural, I'm Craig G 
 Jesse James meets Jet Li 
 Killing these fakes at breakneck speed 
 I make your head steam like a pet peeve 
 Get your neck squeezed till the breath leaves 
 Got the finesse and the prestige 
 And more Mac than 10 tech geeks dissing XP 
 Best in the league of vets like ex-marines highest pedigree 
 When I get the beat it's hereditary 
 Genetic freak poetically 
 One-ten degree Memphis heat spittin' steadily 
 Medically decapitate this rapper's face 
 Still won't get a head of me 
 I'm the best I'll ever be (Yeah!) 
 The cats out the bag, the new Shad's out 
 Now they spell it S.H.A.D.D. the way I spaz out 
 I don't bad mouth but I'll quickly put down the cat if he bit me like 
 Roy's boy Siegfried, Welcome to the big leagues 
 Where they pitch heat, still on a hit streak 
 My rappin's like battin' .360 
 *Hey Griffey slow down do something less cerebral* 
 I ain't big enough yet 
 *I gotta keep impressin' people* 
 I get it, guess it's a lesser evil 
 Weapons lethal as a Desert Eagle 
 Now my lethal weapon won (one) 
 You don't get a sequel 
 I Get it... 
 No eviction notice still I'm homeless on a poets mission 
 Not that I'm a fiend stealing bass like Otis Nixon 
 Livin' on the street naw I'm livin' on the road consistent 
 Making fans multiply like a coefficient 
 Record sales I'm making low commission but the visions mine 
 They don't change my record like pitchin' a no decision 
 Guitar playing emcee Yeah I'm known for spittin' 
 While I'm tappin on my fender like cars in a slow collision 
 The precision of my flows in terms of tone and diction 
 Is akin to that of the old masters of prose and fiction 
 So many sold their souls, my soul ambitions 
 To hold solace so calm and bright as a solar system 
 I'm from a soul tradition; heads think I'm going to prison 
 'Cause I'm talking off this rap sheet with the most conviction 
 The most commitment, no other pro is so proficient 
 The coldest spittin', Rakim north pole edition 
 Listen!
