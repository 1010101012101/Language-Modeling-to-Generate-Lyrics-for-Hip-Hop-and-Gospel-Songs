I heard you had a voice like an angel 
 I heard a strange tale 
 About a saint that fell 
 Music became jail 
 These bars 
 I hear you rapped/wrapped in em 
 Wove in the beats 
 Like the clothing of sheep 
 Wolves tracks 
 Spin em 
 DJ's, CD's 
 C-notes 
 G's thrown on d's 
 We'll be king like T.I hope 
 I heard you even sang when you spoke 
 And the emotion you evoked got you choked 
 When your beauty struck a vocal chord broke 
 Boatless dove overboard 
 Look upon the ocean 
 Caught your reflection before the Lord's 
 I heard you had a voice like an angel 
 Strange though 
 You were blinded by the light 
 Shining from your own halo 
 Fell off 
 Sort of like a rainbow when heaven watched 
 Your faint glow fade slow 
 I heard you had a voice like an angel... 
 I heard that fame's a killer 
 That can murder great princes 
 Like Kurt Cobain singing Purple Rain 
 From a distance 
 Hope home ain't a virtual game 
 Nor this cursed place earth 
 Where the dollars and the karma don't circulate 
 The world's a stage 
 And you know this play well 
 Gee I bet you even know how it ends, pray tell 
 Had a voice like an angel, now you score the drama scenes 
 The comedy's the fact 
 We enact what you want to be 
 Had some old songs still stuck in your memory 
 Distorted though 
 So you sort of re-assembled melodies 
 And fine-tuning turned 'em into single after single 
 In this industry you built so sinfully simple for 
 You to write 'cause, a song is what your life was 
 The destiny of stars is their light must 
 Fight dusk 
 With sparks of brilliance to ignite us 
 And of all the billions of stars 
 You were by far the brightest 
 I heard you had a voice like an angel 
 Now its just a light hush... 
 Now you keep everybody's eyes on charts and schedules 
 And the trends trying to stack gold bars and medals 
 They want vessels void and dark as space 
 Fools wanna make stars instead of music that's smart or special 
 Because art at a level that's real can be harder to peddle 
 Business prefers a market that settles for second rate 
 Kill the true artists martyr the rebels 
 That's the system and it's straight from the heart of the devil 
 (See) 
 Merchants of dreams 
 Sold to souls eyes-wide shut 
 Passin the buck to purchase a pass to buy stuff 
 Workin' in this circus get hired up 
 To walk over half-knots on a tight rope 
 Tied-up in my gut 
 It's a delicate balance 
 Developin' the talent 
 Into persons that we worship 
 Yo, it's a hell of a challenge 
 I heard you had a voice like an angel 
 And don't really sing no more 
 But you still running the game so 
 If we don't behave like them 
 They call us crazy 
 And if we won't slave for them 
 They call us lazy 
 Lately 
 I've started to see why you hate me 
 Hearin' this voice it must be painful 
 To the ears when for years 
 You had a voice like an angel... 
 If you don't behave like them 
 They call you crazy 
 And if you won't slave for them 
 They call you lazy 
 Well I say... 
 They wanna take your mind 
 Turn it into a prison 
 Lock you inside 
 Then they call that livin' 
 Well I say... 
 (x2) 
 I heard you had a voice like an angel. 
 Smile for the camera 
 Smile for the camera 
 While they take your children 
 Smile for the camera 
 While we rape your women 
 Smile for the camera 
 While we make our millions 
 Smile for the camera 
 While we make our buildings 
 Smile for the camera 
 Smile for the camera 
 Smile for the camera
