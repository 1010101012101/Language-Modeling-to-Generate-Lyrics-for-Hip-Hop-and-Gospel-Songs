A-rock rock to it, a-freak freak to it, a-to the beat to it, it's unique music 
 A-rock rock to it, a-freak freak to it, a-to the beat to it, this is how we do it 
 Shad concocts plots and perfects clever scams 
 You can't find a better man in an Eddie Vedder Jam 
 MC's can't see the flow, unbelievable 
 We set records even when the needle's broke 
 Don't need the dough, asking more bang for your buck 
 The only lands a Canuck, that can't handle a puck 
 Played penalty killas skillfully, pass and poke check 
 When black flows jet there's mo'cash than OPEC 
 Or Exxon, Ex-cons, exploit the oil fields of the inner cities 
 Someday I hope the soils heal 
 I toil building a dream where my future can stay safe 
 A place where I never have to move it or vacate 
 Physically I'm not in great shape 'cause I placate 
 And don't consume greens besides whatever grass my steak ate 
 The fakes keep frontin' but I just don't care 
 Wearing forces is the only time I put on airs 
 I spit hard a hard hittin' verse, when I'm spittin' it hurts 
 I never shift into first, let alone put the whip in reverse 
 My freestyling's like a gift and a curse 
 So sick with the verse, you gotta think I'd written it first 
 And plus my, skills with sounds thrills the crowds 
 I could fill my mouth with Prozac pills and I'll still get down 
 A-rock rock to it, a-freak freak to it, a-to the beat to it, it's unique music 
 A-rock rock to it, a-freak freak to it, a-to the beat to it, this is how we do it 
 Now whether on stage or in the studio space 
 We schoolin cats to the game it's just the usual case 
 I'm like you wanna learn to flow homie move to the bass 
 And if you wanna make dough homie move to the States 
 I see suckers in style and musical taste 
 'Cause when we step on the stage and flash the futiful face 
 It makes the honeys hearts beat above a suitable pace 
 Showing the super stylistics very few could replace 
 I'm that ill rap scholar never sweat the finances 
 Just taking out a bank loan big as my campus 
 These MC's need to stop taking their chances 
 Why scrap when you know my arms stronger than Lances? 
 Touring France with these mad rappers locked in their stances 
 They thought they had a move until I blocked their advances 
 I'll be low key chillin' rhymes, filling the whole sheet 
 Feeling down loading on sizzlin so seek 
 Students slash rapper so I'm dealing with no sleep 
 I'm still a cold thief when I'm stealing the show peeps 
 Get out this young brother with doubts 
 My tongue smothers the whack 
 The dub never uncovered the traps 
 So I'm trying to give light through these mic devices 
 Not that I'm perfect only Christ was vice-less 
 But there's too many dealing with the life and crisis 
 All I want's a warm home and a wife that's righteous 
 We gonna get there y'all we gonna rock to it 
 We gonna rock to it, yeah we rock to it 
 We gonna rock to it, a freak freak to it, a to the beat to it, it's unique music 
 A rock rock to it, a freak freak to it, a to the beat to it, this is how we do it 
 I'm like the Biz Mark I write rap tunes in the bathroom 
 My influences are Black Moon and Pat Boone 
 I roll with a whole platoon of phat goons 
 Who keep the hair on their backs groomed with Vidal Sassoon 
 Pick up the phone just to get the tone 
 My bicep claim I gotta leg up, so when I walk the talk I high-step 
 As a fetus I kicked rhymes upon their scans 
 Even back in 82 my ultra-sound was the jam 
 I just rock to it never get forced into nothing 
 But words like a mullet-cutting short on the front end 
 Y'all life's more than cake, no offense to the ballers 
 But we all pay too much attention to dollars 
 Brainwashed yo I'm still learning how to be me 
 Worth millions, I'd rather be freak, uniquely 
 No, I may never know myself completely 
 If I make it home then maybe then I'll meet me 
 Just a capital b-boy like Beat Street and DC 
 Rock to it while I take it easy c'mon 
 We gonna rock to it, a freak freak to it, a to the beat to it, its unique music 
 A rock rock to it, a freak freak to it, a to the beat to it, it's how we do it
