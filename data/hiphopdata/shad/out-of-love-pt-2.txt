So I wrote this song once - out of love 
 About a scrub 
 In a crowded club or lounge 
 Surrounded by these hounds and thugs 
 And he goes home and he pouts because 
 Well first of all, his ears hurt from shoutin stuff 
 Trying to flirt when the sound is up 
 So he already feels down and plus 
 He just got clowned and struck out so many times 
 That now hes out of touch 
 Well as the story goes, that boy never found his luck 
 Sleeps in his folks' house 
 On the couch or just around the rug 
 Legs spread starfish-style 
 Mouth is up 
 Singin' "look out the window" 
 Blah blah 
 Loud as what 
 You know childish stuff 
 The things you do when you're lonely 
 But homies gotta be all proud and such 
 Like 'we don't love them hos' 
 That's what they all say 
 Still I seen many fall prey to a doll face 
 They sayin' I ain't all straight 
 Cause dimes recognize me now in the hallway 
 And flash a smile, I pass 'em quick with a small wave 
 Basically punk 'em so my boys get mad and punch me 
 In the junk till my balls ache 
 Look out the window and there's rainstorms 
 I let the wind blow out a brain storm 
 Shad's back on that emo tip 
 Oh good. 
 The scarf and the tight jeans complete the whole look 
 Why don't you go cook 
 Some vegan food and rent The Notebook 
 We all need a good cry shad, you so should! 
 Then maybe you'll feel better 
 And won't put together another lame long love song 
 With no hook! 
 Go sniff a rose bush and learn how to rap again 
 I thought you got your flow back, what happened man 
 You had that super difficult, seven syllables at the minimal 
 A-typical schemes and you packed 'em in 
 Now you slack and when you rappin', you have to grin 
 Cause you know that them rhymes is as wack as sin 
 And not half as dope as you had 'em then 
 Shad dude, when was the last time you grabbed a pen 
 And worked your brains out, spat flames out 
 You tame now 
 Sort of got this half-way lame style 
 And this is sort of an aside, but you've gained pounds 
 Spending all day laid out on that same couch! 
 Whatever happened to 'I want a clair huxtable' 
 And 'the only rap videos I make are instructional' 
 I think you got a little bit too comfortable 
 And you still out of love, so what you gonna do...
