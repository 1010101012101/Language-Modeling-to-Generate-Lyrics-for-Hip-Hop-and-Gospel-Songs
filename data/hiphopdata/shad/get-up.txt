(Verse One) 
 Before I take a mic 
 Take a break beat or a break to write 
 Break me down lord please and shape my life 
 We need leaders 
 These elitists got nothing to teach us 
 By they strength, our children need to see Jesus in their weakness 
 And keep seekin' where 
 Free speech is rare 
 And realness gets kept less frequent than these secrets 
 Share a couple stories 
 Like a town home or brownstone 
 Over loud phones about my hang ups and dial tones 
 Swim in heaven and at worst you get drowned toe'd down 
 To the place where the clouds roam 
 So we get up 
 All my people feeling bored and strange 
 If you don't feel at home in this conformist state 
 Don't ignore the pain 
 That's the lord that's sayin' 
 To you stand up King you were born to reign 
 That's the war that's waged 
 And the important thang 
 Ain't what you'd die for 
 It's what you live for today 
 Get up even if they knock us down 
 They can't can't stop us 
 Smile right back at 'em laugh and then get up 
 Actions speak louder than a thousands talkers 
 So make 'em blast that in their Walk Man's 
 (Verse Two) 
 Its hard to stand in a nation where the masses sit 
 Idle and passionless 
 Politics is polls 
 In the papers all the facts are skipped 
 Can't ascertain so the scholars place an asterisk 
 And stories on the stars to dumb down 
 And distract us with 
 We can't help but feel detached from this 
 Capitalist confusin' communion of corporate sponsors and advocates 
 Where every actor is an activist 
 But a movie cast wont fix these broken homes full of fractured kids 
 Aren't broken bones you can wrap up quick 
 Folks trying to master this game that I call money for masochists 
 Where if you wanna make a cut 
 Gotta match their risk 
 Dig in your pockets, not for cash 
 But to slash your wrists 
 And fashion's just a game of who can follow fads fastest wish 
 Some kind of miraculous world change can happen quick 
 But these problems don't take seconds to solve 
 And getting mad ain't the same thing as getting involved 
 We need to get up 
 Get up even if they knock us down 
 They can't can't stop us 
 Smile right back at 'em laugh and then get up 
 Actions speak louder than a thousands talkers 
 So make 'em blast that in their Walk Man's 
 (Verse Three) 
 Get a mic 
 Get skill 
 Get ice 
 Get bills 
 Get the life 
 That you always wanted and then get killed 
 Get slain 
 Cause the rappers that do 
 Get fame 
 Its insane 
 All they talk about is who should get blamed 
 Young brothers get steel 
 Before they get aim 
 And they wanna get it pulled 
 Before they get trained 
 'Cause they wanna get respect 
 Get checks 
 Get dames 
 Things we all wanna get 
 But end up getting drained trying to get em 
 We get stressed and we get strained 
 We don't all get the ghetto 
 But we all get pain 
 Before I get to the refrain 
 I hope you get what I'm sayin' 
 Its messed, but we just might get some change if we get up 
 Get up even if they knock us down 
 They can't can't stop us 
 Smile right back at 'em laugh and then get up 
 Actions speak louder than a thousands talkers 
 So make 'em blast that in their Walk Man's
