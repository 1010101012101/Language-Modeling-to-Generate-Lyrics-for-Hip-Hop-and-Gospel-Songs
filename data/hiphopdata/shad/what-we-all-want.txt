What happens when the walls drop 
 The lies and the disguises and the small talk 
 That cover up the pain and the shame and the bald spots 
 We're runaway trains what happens when it all stops 
 Artists drop gems that ring false rocks 
 We shouldve got those calls blacked like Alstott 
 We're feedin our mind from the tree in Eden 
 Lately I've been reading what paul taught - freedom 
 That's what we all want... 
 (Relic The Oddity) 
 I wanna be on a level of skill 
 That's gold medal 
 But still I'm unsettled like 
 Clogs man - those are some hard shoes to fill 
 Especially when the pressure on and the lights is off 
 Me and my wife's just tryin' to pay bills 
 And keep my son occupied 
 And keep the stocking filled when the holidays arrive 
 I try to be a good provider 
 Successful on the spiritual side but made a mess 
 When it came to my debts 
 Now let's take a lesson from it 
 I stand on the summit of sums that reflect 
 The lesser things that I've wanted in life 
 I don't want to be haunted by my decisions 
 I'll admit balancing wants and needs comes with a price 
 And I'm paying it twice 
 First with the cards, second with the interest 
 It ain't that nice 
 I've been blessed so I guess I know what's right 
 What I really want is peace from God and insight 
 It's what we all want, right? 
 Yo it's hard to be, 
 Man it's hard to just be 
 Especially with this artistry it's hard to be 
 Black and not be a hard emcee or r&b 
 And that's cool if that's you but 
 What if all you are is me? 
 Man start the beat cause all my heart can see 
 Is a dark and bleak 
 Night sky painted on my mind so I spark this speech 
 Like stars to bleed light when it's hard to see 
 More than guitars and being down with a label that can 
 Market me I've scarred my knees 
 Praying hard for peace of mind and a heart that's free... 
 Cause yo - that's what we all want...
