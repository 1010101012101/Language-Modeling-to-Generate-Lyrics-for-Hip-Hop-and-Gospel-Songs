I try to hold some hope in my heart 
 For these African youths 
 Coming up where I'm from 
 Many traps to elude 
 Surrounded by 
 Mostly white and affluent dudes 
 And somehow, you expected to have 
 Mastered this smooth 
 Swagger and move 
 With the right walk, the right talk 
 Fashion and crews 
 Souls subtly attacked and abused 
 And what's funny's being black wasn't cool 
 Where I'm from till suddenly 
 You started hearing rap in the school 
 Hallways 
 Admist this madness I grew 
 With knack for amusing through this little skill 
 For rappin' at dudes 
 An' we all like to laugh at the truth 
 But when you young and same facts 
 Pertain to who you rappin' 'em to 
 Well, I opted not to bring 
 That to the booth 
 But after a while, it sort of starts naggin at you 
 The crazed infatuation with blackness 
 That trash that gets viewed 
 And the fact that the tube only showed blacks 
 Actin' the fool and I was watching... 
 (Saturated with negative images and a limited range of 
 Possibilities is strange...) 
 And it's sad cause that naturally do 
 Sort of condition your mind and over time 
 That's what's attractive to you 
 So young blacks don't see themselves in 
 Scholastic pursuits 
 Or the more practical routes 
 It's makin' tracks or it's hoops 
 Or God-forbid movin packs for the loot 
 Even with this music we so limited - it's rap or produce 
 And that narrow conception of what's black isn't true 
 Of course, still we feel forced to adapt to this view 
 Like there's something that you're havin' to prove 
 Now add that to the slew 
 Of justification the capitalists use 
 For the new blaxploitation 
 Many actions excused 
 In the name of getting cash 
 That's adversely impactin our youth 
 With mental slavery, the shackles is loose 
 And it's hard to cut chains when they attached at the roots 
 So what the new black activists do 
 For our freedom is just being them 
 Do what you're passionate to 
 Not confined by a sense that you have to disprove 
 Any stereotypes, so-called facts to refute 
 Or match any image of blackness 
 They've established as true 
 Perhaps we'll break through the glass ceilings 
 Shatter the roof and emerge 
 From these boxes that they have us in cooped 
 And grow to smash the bold that they casted of you 
 I'll keep watching...
