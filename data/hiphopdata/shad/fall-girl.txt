Yeah you, 
 I remember the day we met 
 It was the middle of May, I was just waking up from hibernation 
 In the night we locked eyes and kissed 
 It was the Fourth of July, you were just about to get back together 
 With your old flame, and now the weather's changed 
 And I'm getting cold, the year's getting old, old 
 They say you better lock something down 
 Before all the leaves hit the ground 
 By the time the fall hits 
 They evolve, split, to find someone to keep 'em warm 
 And it's autumn, they've all got one 
 And you're alone for the winter storms 
 I need a fall girl 
 'Cause it's a small world 
 And the summer's done 
 Yeah I, 
 I had the most frightful dream, I awoke 
 All alone on Halloween 
 With the permafrost falling down my window 
 Mama's saddened to see I arrived 
 All alone on Christmas Eve 
 With no pretty girl for her to welcome 
 Now the winter's here and so we seldom hear 
 And I try to find, someone to call mine 
 They say you better lock something down 
 Before all the leaves hit the ground 
 By the time the fall hits 
 They evolve, split, to find someone to keep 'em warm 
 And it's autumn, they've all got one 
 And you're alone for the winter storms 
 I need a fall girl 
 'Cause it's a small world 
 And the summer's done
