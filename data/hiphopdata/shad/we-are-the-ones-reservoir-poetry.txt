Yeah, yeah, check it. 
 Love, I get so lost 
 Lost as Mathew Fox 
 Sad dude in a bad mood rising 
 Bad mood, feelin' down 
 Bad music 
 Call him in Neptunes 
 'Seein' Sounds' 
 Down like a running back needed ground 
 Bit my tongue, bleeding mouth 
 Got red drippin' on my new sneaks 
 Slipped on my two feet 
 Toes in the air 
 I'm livin' on a nude beach 
 And everybody here's in a two piece 
 While my souls bare 
 "Boobies" 
 Spelled on a calculator... 
 True School rapper with middle school humor 
 Old School like Will Ferrel with no school tutor, real 
 It's not a tumor 
 That was a flat out rumor 
 My head never swelled 
 But you assume the ballooned 
 Mind-state will inflate into Myspace 
 At a high rate 
 It makes me irate 
 My module is lunar 
 And needs a tune up 
 Makes it hard to drive straight 
 Imagining gravity-defying happenings installed under my driveways 
 Parked sideways for more than four out of five days 
 The other two have slipped up, ablaze 
 Now twist-up, the high-grade, my mind mixed-up 
 And phased out my faith and turned it into doubt, I'm out 
 We are the ones, that you are not 
 You are the ones, we will never be now 
 It's the, Mister North of the 49, spit up 
 The sort of rhymes, you can borderline picture 
 Storytime, Slick Rick meets Mordechai Richler 
 On point like a porcupine prickler 
 Yeah, I put it down break ground like quakes 
 Shake your beaker off the scale overweight 
 Heavy-hitter with the switch-stance 34 waist 
 Always drop on the buttons and I'm stayin' in shape 
 And I'm Shad, you can add a "K" if you wish to 
 Official scatterbrain, East of Adelaide I miss you 
 I get Live like Saturday Night, no issue 
 Now that's all that I have to say, Rizzle who is you? 
 Now I'm the mystery hidden in the riddle within the puzzle 
 Dealing with the issues on delivery, critical 
 I'm quick, on the uptake Relic fits rally 
 On the status updates, we're the ones you must rate 'cause... 
 We are the ones, that you are not 
 You are the ones, we will never be now 
 (x2) 
 A nice lady, take her out for a nice meal like veal 
 (Clubbin'?) Nah, too loud and too crowded 
 It's not Two-thousand and Nine, B 
 I ain't 19, I ain't waitin' in no line; please 
 It's boring as pourin' over rhyme schemes 
 And cats grindin' tryin' to be the last sign like Pisces 
 I'm not Chinese, but I like me some light chi iced tea with pearls 
 Find me on a nice beach doin' Tai Chi with girls 
 And it's likely that I might see the world off of rappin' these bars 
 It's a trick passin' these stars in a casting call for the acting captain in charge 
 I'm the black Captain Picard... 
 Sergent of the rebel army, charming as a devil with hustle on the level of Barney Rubble on Red Bull 
 A vessel at the end of the day, I'm not the bee's knees, 
 Only need knees to bend them to pray 
 Break bread with the saints, for the sake of having bread during the wake 
 This here's a full-time work group 
 And virtue is on-and-off of the church pew 
 Searching you find, 
 Before this verse through, find the merch booth spend some time (ow!) 
 (Chorus to outro)
