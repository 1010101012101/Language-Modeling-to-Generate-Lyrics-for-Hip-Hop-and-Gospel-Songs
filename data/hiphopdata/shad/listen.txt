Listenin to strange fruit, Jay root and beirut 
 Tryin' to listen to Jesus its hard as fake boobs 
 At times I stay tuned hear the bread break 
 And grape juice and grey goose gossiple 
 Prelude let it play through 
 I'm listenin to Mr J Medeiros and Nicolay 
 While I'm hearing drips of rain 
 Hit against the window pane 
 Hits on tape, hit parade 1968 
 When it plays I hear the bullets penetrate 
 MLK, soul levitate 
 When the plane starts to escalate 
 Top gun, take my breath away 
 Its time to press and play 
 Drop the needle then step away 
 Hear what's said off the record 
 Before there's nothin' left to say 
 In my room listenin to sermon Gershwin, 
 Earth wind, and fire 
 Listenin to persons I admire 
 Searchin for higher learnin like ice cube 
 On i-tunes, listenin to grown men 
 Rappin' like it's highschool 
 Listenin to friends talk, hearin my pen stop 
 Used to write first, now I try to listen then jot 
 Listenin to pop like reddenbachs 
 City to the boondocks 
 Can't you hear the games like a jukebox? 
 Cause you gotta pay to play 
 And there's no lay-away 
 Hearin from folks caught in real snares, no 808 
 Real talk, my vocals go and slay the tape 
 I say it straight and never twice 
 No fake delay 
 Listen with the volume down, push the sound back 
 If every lifes a movie all our soundtracks 
 Sound like sound clash 
 All our sounds bleeding in 
 To each other no sound reasonin 
 Stop, breathe again, listen 
 Music is a great way to heal 
 And a safe place to feel 
 Trapped in this fake world 
 A gateway to real 
 It's a great way to heal 
 And a safe place to feel 
 Trapped in this fake world 
 A gateway to real 
 Listenin to sounds in a space that's vacant 
 Profound and deep, underground as basements 
 And quiet as kept but I found it sacred 
 A sage said silence is the sound of patience 
 Listen
