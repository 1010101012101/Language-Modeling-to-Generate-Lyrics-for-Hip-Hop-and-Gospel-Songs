I didn't promise you a rose garden 
 Along with the sunshine 
 There's gonna be some rain sometimes 
 (Rain, rain, rain sometimes) 
 Watch out! 
 I didn't promise you a rose garden (Yeah) 
 Along with the sunshine 
 There's gonna be some rain sometimes 
 (Rain, rain, rain sometimes) 
 Listen 
 When Abraham went to slash Isaac (There's gonna be some) 
 In a sense he baptized him 
 Rabbi said, don't trust them cash prizes 
 Same things that float your boat can capsize it (There's gonna be some) 
 Tell the snakes they can take a hike like gas prices 
 No such things as halfway crooks, (There's gonna be some) the half righteous 
 Those who have eyes should act like it 
 To help the sightless (There's gonna be some) seeking the light switch 
 To see in the night with we leadin' the lifeless, uh 
 Sometimes I just wanna (There's gonna be some) play some shows make some dough 
 Take it home lay in my bed and stay in my safety zone 
 But Cee-Lo said it best (There's gonna be some) 
 I know too much and I owe too much to let it rest 
 Heard a voice say hey 
 You never question (There's gonna be some) when you get the blessing 
 So don't get vexed when your life is stressed 
 And I promised I'll be with you (There's gonna be some rain sometimes) no matter what the issue 
 (Rain, rain, rain sometimes) 
 But there will be some issues to address 
 Listen to the lady in the dress 
 I didn't promise you a rose garden 
 Along with the sunshine (Uh-huh) 
 There's gonna be some rain sometimes 
 (Rain, rain, rain sometimes) 
 I didn't promise you a rose garden 
 Along with the sunshine 
 There's gonna be some rain sometimes 
 (Rain, rain, rain sometimes) 
 It's like this, check it 
 I'm not in the zone there's too much in the way (There's gonna be some) 
 I weigh two bucks and if I had two slugs to spray 
 Like Rah Rah (There's gonna be some) Glenn Beck better duck like foie gras 
 Make shots poke his face like GaGa (There's gonna be some) 
 But mama says forgive, so I'll give him that bar like a Mars and let him live 
 The Mississauga continues, (There's gonna be some) rantin while my DJ's lampin like Green Lantern, samplin' 
 Mansions, nah I ain't rich (There's gonna be some) as Richard Branson 
 I'm King Kong meets Vince Vaughn and I play like a champion 
 My Monday ball league, (There's gonna be some) nah B all week 
 7 days of black power naps every 48 half hours, that's 24 (There's gonna be some) star Jack Bauer 
 Can't cower when the rain falls, and it falls whether you Gandhi or you Adolf (There's gonna be some) 
 Fall weather but there's always a way y'all 
 Make the call no rain delay play ball 
 I didn't promise you a rose garden (No) 
 Along with the sunshine (Yeah) 
 There's gonna be some rain sometimes 
 (Rain, rain, rain sometimes) 
 (Listen to the lady in the dress say it best) 
 I didn't promise you a rose garden (Uh-huh) 
 Along with the sunshine (Yeah) 
 There's gonna be some rain sometimes 
 (Rain, rain, rain sometimes) 
 (There's gonna be some rain, sing it out) 
 I didn't promise you a rose garden 
 Along with the sunshine 
 There's gonna be some rain sometimes 
 (Rain, rain, rain sometimes) 
 I didn't promise you a rose garden 
 Along with the sunshine 
 There's gonna be some rain sometimes 
 (Rain, rain, rain sometimes) 
 I didn't promise you a rose garden 
 Along with the sunshine 
 There's gonna be some rain sometimes 
 (Rain, rain, rain sometimes)
