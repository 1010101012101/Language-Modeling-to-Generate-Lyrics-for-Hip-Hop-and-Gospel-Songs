(Feat. E-40) 
 E-E-E-40 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go 
 Sponsorin' that soil, mayne 
 Go, go, (go dumb) go, go, (go dumb) go, go, (go dumb) 
 Lookout Pimp 
 Go, go, (go dumb) go, go, (go dumb) go, go, (go dumb) 
 Dumb-d-dumb dumb 
 Go, go, (go dumb) go, go, (go dumb) go, go, (go dumb) 
 Dumb-d-dumb dumb dumb 
 Pay attention to this beat like Dr. Spock ears 
 40's been spittin' heat for many many years 
 Runnin' game, nothin' but game I had to sprinkle 
 Sprinkle sprinkle sprinkle sprinkle (decorated jingle) 
 Sittin' 'n' rear safety belt, head protection airbags, 
 Anti-lock brakes so I can smash 
 Then water my grass, make it greener than it used to be 
 Don't act like y'all ain't used to me 
 Bustin' like an uzi on a mirco-fitted g 
 Lookin' for some cuchi in my drop Chevy 
 Malibu, Calibu, I was ankled through the soil 
 Compatible, radicial, man I'm erkin' off that oil 
 Walkin' through the party with my mug on 
 Sippin' in the party gettin' my buzz on 
 Booty everywhere, short and long hair 
 It's groovy up in here, plenty for us to share 
 Dumb-d-dumb dumb 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go, 
 Dumb-d-dumb dumb 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go, 
 Dumb-d-dumb dumb 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go, 
 Dumb-d-dumb dumb 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go, 
 Dumb-d-dumb dumb dumb 
 Ladies love me y'all 
 See? Y'all don't understand 
 I ain't Denzel, but I'm aiight for a big man 
 I like signin' autographs, it doesn't bother me 
 I'm not an arrogant rapper. I be figgin' thee 
 The pharmacudial musical slangin' venturer 
 The antidote, like olive oil and vinegar 
 Bush-masters, two 23's, man, plutoneum 
 Lock-master, got more keys than a custodian 
 Not a backpacker rapper, I usually stay in my place, but hey 
 I ain't gon lie I need y'alls fan base 
 How far ahead am I? 
 I had to demonstrate a bottle of Louis XIII in 1998 
 On my album cover, I had a double album out 
 The element of surprise, that's all I talked about 
 Be on the lookout for my Dictionary: Book of Slang Thang 
 Finally comin', I'm brought to y'all by Murder-Mad Magazine 
 Mack like my street, the 13-hundred block 
 Kick my feet on this rap, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout 
 Dumb-d-dumb dumb 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go, 
 Dumb-d-dumb dumb 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go, 
 Dumb-d-dumb dumb 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go, 
 Dumb-d-dumb dumb 
 Go, go, go, go, go, go, 
 Dumb-d-dumb dumb dumb
