 DJ class verse: 
 How could anybody say that dey the **** like I be 
 Bring the club to life like I done gave the crowd an IV 
 I P, not me, anywhere I go they follow me 
 Moet straight from the bottle while I hook up my Serato 
 Then I say check, One, Two 
 Need more than one fly girl, gimme two 
 All of yawl together huh? Bring your whole crew 
 Tryin' to fit you all in the DJ booth 
 Sip on something eighty proof 
 Get these sexy ladies loose 
 Tear the club up raise the roof 
 Then link up wit me like Bluetooth

 Jermaine dupri verse: 
 One, Two - One, Two 
 In the place to be, I go by the name of Jermaine Dupri 
 First I let everybody know who I am 
 Den I drop the hottest jam 
 Den I watch this ***** go crazy, where I'm from we call it ham (atl) 
 Then I hit the roll call 
 Just to get to know y'all 
 Then I take a sip a what I'm drinking just to show y'all (circoc baby) 
 Why the club keep callin' me back 
 Why the dance floor so damn packed 
 Why when he play the same thing; I play; his **** just don't sound 
 Like that (uh, uuh) 
 Or this (nope) 
 Just like the homie Class girlfriend, I'm The **** 
 That, or this, it's amazing what I can getchu ta do wit the flick of my wrist 
 Clinton sparks chorus:
