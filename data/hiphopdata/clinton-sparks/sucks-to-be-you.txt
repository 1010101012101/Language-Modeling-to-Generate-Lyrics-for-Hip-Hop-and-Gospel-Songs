 Calling up my phone 
 Showing up at the club 
 When I tell you to stop 
 You just keep showing up 
 'Cause you're feeling regret 
 Now that we are through 
 Through th th th th through 
 Since the day you left 
 Everything's been cool 
 Thought that you were fresh 
 But the joke's on you 
 And now what we had 
 Saw that you clang too (clang too) 
 I bet it sucks to be you, you, you (x2) 
 Yeah it sucks to be you, you, you 
 It must suck to be you, you, you 
 When you say me 
 You must of been out of your damn mind (damn mind) 
 You break my heart and now you wanna cry? (wanna cry?) 
 Mad at yourself because of me you fail (me you fail) 
 Cause even me, girl was your epic fail 
 (You lose!) 
 (Lmfao) 
 I see your tweets 
 On how I'm so sweet 
 How you miss taking trips to bar 
 Getting freaky by the tikki on the beach 
 Uh, but you should've known 
 That you should have never done me wrong 
 Now I'm in the club singing david guetta girl, the love is gone 
 You gotta be out of your damn mind (damn mind) 
 You break my heart and now you wanna cry ? (wanna cry?) 
 Now, really wasn't worth that other dude 
 You slip and slide and say bye bye you fool, I'm gone! 
 I bet it sucks to be you, you, you (x2) 
 Yeah it sucks to be you, you, you 
 It must suck to be you, you, you 
 When you say me 
 You must of been out of your damn mind (damn mind) 
 You break my heart and now you wanna cry? (wanna cry?) 
 Mad at yourself because of me you fail (me you fail) 
 Cause even me, girl was your epic fail 
 (You lose!)

 Stop calling me drunk 
 When you stumble in home 
 Boy you shit outta luck 
 You gonna be sleeping alone 
 Oh and stop telling lies 
 As if I'm stopping you 
 You know you be crying to my bestfriends and my mama too 
 You're really creeping me out 
 And will you leave it alone 
 Don't be surprised if I just go ahead and cut off the phone 
 And you're so stuck in the past 
 You need to just let it go, go, go 
 I bet it sucks to be you, you, you (x2) 
 Yeah it sucks to be you, you, you 
 It must suck to be you, you, you 
 When you say me 
 Man I ain't tipping on you I'm just gonna go out and (party) 
 We gonna hit the club because tonight we gonna (rock) 
 So if you happen to run into me out at the (party) 
 Don't bother talking cause you and me ain't gonna have a (rock) 
 Bitch I'm gone (x3)
