 (Over Chorus) 
 Yeah, uh...

 (Verse One: Lil' Flip) 
 Yeah, you know me I'm the Underground Legend 
 But I Rap-A-Lot like Scarface and Devin 
 I'm from Houston, you know how we got down 
 I got a bitch that'll rob you when you hit town 
 I got vatos, and they shot O's 
 Try to jack me they run up with glock fo's 
 Muh'fuckers wanna talk all tough 
 When I see 'em at they shows they don't wanna get rough 
 A lot of niggaz wanna be like 'Pac 
 Until they ass get shot nigga, now who on top nigga? 
 A lot of niggaz wanna be like B.I.G. 
 But when I look at they BS, they shit ain't big 
 Yeah, the "Game Over," I'ma drop again 
 Gotta check now I'm straight at the lot again 
 Yeah, muh'fucker this the muh'fuckin' payback 
 I'm in the gray black on black, Maybach 
 I'm in the front wit'cha bitch, I got a blunt in ya bitch 
 Muh'fuckers know I run this shit

 You a loser muh'fucker we the muh'fuckin' winners 
 (Verse Two: Lil' Flip) 
 Uh-oh! Y'all niggaz don't wanna go to war 
 Cause AK's will go through your car 
 Yeah! And y'all niggaz don't want no beef 
 Cause fuckin' with me, you'll fuck around and hurt yo' teeth nigga 
 And we don't play when we come to your town 
 I'm like 'Ball and 'G, lay it down 
 You got it I want it I come and get it, nigga 
 I'm the best, you gotta admit it, nigga 
 I freestyle I ain't gotta write shit nigga 
 What I drop you ain't gotta like shit nigga 
 But it's gon' sell nigga, and you gon' wanna do 
 A track with me, plus I got my fuckin' gat with me
