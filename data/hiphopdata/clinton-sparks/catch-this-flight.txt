Please don't think for one minute 
 That I will play your soul, 
 But you knew from the beginning that I have major flows 
 And nothing will prevent me from seeing you bruise, 
 So, please do not resent me, 'cause I love when I'm with you, 
 And I see what you go through, but I nothing I can do 
 But to keep my promise... 
 But now I see my absence as taken ... 
 Cause you say it might not be an... starting to get old. 
 And I told you, I hold you, when I'm there at night 
 And I care for you, but I'm there for you, 
 But now I gotta catch this flight! 
 Shwaty don't be mad at, you already know, 
 You belong to me, but now I gotta go! 
 Shwaty, Shwaty don't be mad at, you already know, 
 You belong to me, but now I gotta go! 
 Shwaty don't be mad, you already know, 
 You're the one for me, 
 But now I gotta go! 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh! 
 Say I'm trying to be sexy here, but I'm not... 
 Alternate my plan when I'm trying to succeed, 
 See, I got love for you, but I've got love for me too, 
 And if it came to choose one, I'm sorry, it wouldn't be you! 
 But don't let that get you down, 
 'Cause you're the only one ... when I'm around! 
 But if you're acting... 
 ...Change my mind, cause: 
 And I told you, I hold you, when I'm there at night 
 And I care for you, but I'm there for you, 
 But now I gotta catch this flight! 
 Shwaty don't be mad at, you already know, 
 You belong to me, but now I gotta go! 
 Shwaty, Shwaty don't be mad at, you already know, 
 You belong to me, but now I gotta go! 
 Shwaty don't be mad, you already know, 
 You're the one for me, 
 But now I gotta go! 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh! 
 Girl, you just... 
 I told you I'll be back, 
 I told you I'll hold you, 
 When I'm there at night girl, 
 I care for you, I'm there with you, 
 But now I gotta catch this flight! 
 Shwaty don't be mad at, you already know, 
 You belong to me, but now I gotta go! 
 Shwaty, Shwaty don't be mad at, you already know, 
 You belong to me, but now I gotta go! 
 Shwaty don't be mad, you already know, 
 You're the one for me, 
 But now I gotta go!
