(Feat. Clintos Sparks) 
 I'm too fly to be all up in this line boy, 
 I should get a front cut, I should get a front cut! 
 I'm too fly to be all up in this line boy, 
 I should get a front cut, I should get a front cut! 
 I'm too fly to be all up in this line boy, 
 I should get a front cut, I should get a front cut! 
 Why you are all up in this line, 
 Why you're looking way too fine, 
 These chicks ain't on your level, 
 ...That they could tell you. 
 You know you're looking good, 
 Doing what they wish they could, 
 Plus you spend too much time in the gym, 
 To be in line way behind him. 
 And you're giving out these ... 
 ...Looking like a model, too 
 So they all wanna model you! 
 Talking and they're staring, 
 But you ain't even carrying, 
 Cause just one of your earrings 
 Cost more than what they're wearing. 
 If you find... waiting in the line, girl 
 You should get a front cut, 
 You should get a front cut! 
 I'm too fly to be all up in this line boy, 
 I should get a front cut, I should get a front cut! 
 Oh! 
 Cause who else be attracting, 
 These boys are sent here acting, 
 Like they're money stalking, 
 And then the show they ... in! 
 It's us to get some open, 
 Just from the fact they're hoping, 
 You know I got them flowing, 
 So... 
 You see me coming through, 
 Not just me, my girlfriends too! 
 You know what we came to do, 
 That's why we're in front of you! 
 Just from what we're flashing, 
 We're in the highest fashion, 
 ...Asking, what do we get to pass them? 
 If you find... waiting in the line, girl 
 You should get a front cut, 
 You should get a front cut! 
 I'm too fly to be all up in this line boy, 
 I should get a front cut, I should get a front cut! 
 Oh! 
 ... I gotta wait in line, 
 I said the front door, I shall go in to decide. 
 While I'm... to get through, 
 All of these girls in my crew, 
 Give me a drink or a few, 
 I mean a bottle or two! 
 We've been out here too damn long, 
 ...Play my song, 
 Got my... and my Louis Vuitton on, 
 You better hurry up, or I'll be gone! 
 So don't tell me I gotta wait in the line, 
 Because it's plenty of the clubs that want me inside! 
 You don't try to wait in no line, 
 Cause you know you're just... 
 Put your hands in the sky! 
 If you're not trying to wait in no line, 
 Cause you know you're just... 
 Put your hands in the sky! 
 If you're not trying to wait in no line, 
 Cause you know you're just... 
 Put your hands in the sky! 
 If you find... waiting in the line, girl 
 You should get a front cut, 
 You should get a front cut! 
 I'm too fly to be all up in this line boy, 
 I should get a front cut, I should get a front cut! 
 Oh!
