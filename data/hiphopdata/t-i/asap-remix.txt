 (Verse 1: t.i.) 
 I'm on my grind, grand hustle 
 Got the mind and the muscle 
 50 carrats in the crown just to shine on you suckas 
 I still tote the Glock 40 for the haters and the bustas 
 Fuck probation, if a nigga try to play me I'ma bust him 
 Ion't need no security, reaching for my jewlery 
 Get you niggaz popped quick, filled full of hot shit 
 Fresh out the box Tip hot than a drop 6 
 Made a quarter mil' in the penn givin' stock tips 
 Haters wanna stop Tip, mad 'cause they not Tip 
 Ball every summer so your baby mama jock Tip 
 You don't no drama pimp, I promise I do not slip 
 Chrome 4-5th, hid well if the cops trip 
 Bought my girl a Hummer with the chrome right in front of dat 
 5 carrat stones with the platinum all up under dat 
 Rap beef I ain't gonna participate in none of dat 
 I'm aimin' at your fitted cap and you ain't gonna want none of dat
