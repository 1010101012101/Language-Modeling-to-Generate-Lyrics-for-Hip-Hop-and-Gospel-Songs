Hey Hey Hey Hey 
 Damn shawty 
 Look at you 
 I'm saying man. 
 Is it just me or you got too much ass in them jeans? 
 Come here. 
 Hey 
 I been watchin' you a while now 
 And I just wanna find a way to make you smile now. 
 Why you blushin'? Forget about them other guys now 
 I know you ain't tryin' to tell me that you shy now 
 I realize that you're beauty could intimidate 
 Them suckers you ain't got no business with them anyway 
 With such a, pretty face big booty, little waistline... 
 I wanna grind from behind to the bass line. 
 Have a great time, pull yourself a shot girl 
 Chase it with the lime, now you feeling like a hot girl 
 I know you're probably used to deal with them wannabe's 
 But honestly I gotta say, I'm who they wanna be. 
 I promise all I wanna see is you up under me 
 And we can disappear whenever, when you wanna leave 
 I could guarantee the ride of your life. 
 Any fantasies on your mind? We can try them tonight. 
 Oh yeah sittin' here 
 I'm lookin' at you like damn 
 We sippin' on Patr贸n, something's on my mind 
 You wanna leave with me tonight 
 It's been killin' me all night long, and I wonder 
 Listen shawty let me tell you what I'm thinkin' 'bout 
 Oh girl I wonder 
 For real shawty let me tell you what I'm thinkin' 'bout 
 It's the end of the night, and I'm thinkin' you might 
 Wanna leave the bar, park the car, turn into porn star. 
 Yes, I'd love to hear about your interests 
 I gotta say, your intellect got me impressed 
 See your [...] through your dress like a silhouette. 
 Patr贸n got me thinkin' sex, is you feelin' that? 
 No disrespect, though 
 A simple yes/no 
 Hey let yourself let go, shawty let's go 
 Pull you to the crib, get you through the threshold 
 Kiss you from your pretty lips till your red toes 
 Time tickin' it's the end of the night 
 And you could leave with your friend if you like 
 But I'm saying no 
 Hey we could ride out 
 Back to my house 
 I wanna see you satisfied inside out 
 Once I'm in you ain't gon' want me to slide out 
 You tell your girlfriends they gon' wanna try out 
 A little more of this will loosen you up 
 What we can't do in the club we can do in the truck. 
 Oh yeah sittin' here 
 I'm lookin' at you like damn

 Hey would you... stay? 
 Could you... play with it, with your tongue just a... little? 
 You such a sexy individual physical and mental 
 And if it's sentimental shouldn't rules bend a little 
 Hey let me start at the top stop in the middle use a popsicle 
 Make you shiver giggle when it tickle 
 I could talk to you dirty if you like that 
 I finish once, hit a blun, start right back 
 I know you told me you a good girl 
 But shawty you's grown woman not a little girl 
 You could blame it on the patron or the champagne 
 But sometimes being bad could be a good thing. 
 Oh yeah sittin' here
