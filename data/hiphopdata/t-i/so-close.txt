We came so close almost 
 But still that's no cigar 
 How could our hearts beat so close 
 When our minds so far apart 
 We came so close almost 
 But still that's no cigar 
 How could our hearts beat so close 
 When our minds so far apart 
 We came so close almost 
 But still that's no cigar 
 How could our hearts beat so close 
 When our minds so far apart 
 We came so close 
 Ain't a relationship great 
 Look what it turn to 
 Is this what seven years of dedication earn you 
 I thought you wanted me 
 But you just wanna be 
 Up in somebody VIP where all the suckers be 
 Poppin' bottles, Puffin weed 
 Guess you had enough of me 
 Can't make you what you don't wanna be 
 Luckily I recognize lies you was tellin' in advance 
 Get another chance you do the same shit again 
 You better get some plans 
 Buckin on the system 
 Wonder why I'm so distant 
 You don't listen 
 Either I'm the wrong man or you the wrong Mrs. 
 It's time to say goodbye and blow kisses 
 Moah 
 We came so close almost 
 But still that's no cigar 
 How could our hearts beat so close 
 When our minds so far apart 
 We came so close almost 
 But still that's no cigar 
 How could our hearts beat so close 
 When our minds so far apart 
 We came so close 
 Hey I drink some muddy water 
 Sleep on a hollow log 
 Before I stay and let somebody treat me like a dog 
 Showed you the writing on the wall 
 And you tryin' to blame in on another broad (NAW) 
 Not one of us perfect 
 I ain't the only one that's hurtin' 
 We both wrong and look beneath the surface 
 For certain 
 But still ain't workin 
 Happiness, we both deserve it 
 With that said it's time to close the curtains 
 What's the purpose of stickin around complainin 
 Bout some things that'll never change 
 Bout each other while we suffer 
 Falsify everythang 
 I understand the circumstances 
 Hell I own the situation 
 The fed case and all the jail time a nigga facin 
 But you stayed down and never gave up 
 Remember when we used to drop top and blaze up 
 But them days long gone for the moment 
 Guess love hurts sometimes don't it 
 We came so close almost 
 But still that's no cigar 
 How could our hearts beat so close 
 When our minds so far apart 
 We came so close almost 
 But still that's no cigar 
 How could our hearts beat so close 
 When our minds so far apart 
 We came so close almost 
 But still that's no cigar 
 How could our hearts beat so close 
 When our minds so far apart 
 We came so close
