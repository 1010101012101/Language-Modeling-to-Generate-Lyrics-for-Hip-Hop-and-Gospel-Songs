Baby you the type love only come around once 
 Babe girl you my world, you my soul, 
 Blood in my flesh, you ain't never gotta stress 
 Relax, I ain't never gonna leave you or mislead you 
 Cross my heart hope to die, with needles in my eyes 
 God created us for each other 
 We tougher than all the others, 
 We the best, you and I, competition 
 Nah, we got them by a land slide 
 Up in the G5, drunk off of love, 
 Swerving, got the plane ribbons in the sky 
 I never thought I, would come home from jail 
 And fall in love with baby girl 
 Look, fuck what you heard, look think of all 
 While we laughing so hard, we might piss our past 
 Look, the echelon that we on is beyond anything they dream 
 You the queen of hearts and I'm the king 
 Oh, you're gonna say some shit 
 Like he's not the one for me 
 When everynight he's here for me 
 I won't let him down, I won't never, never leave his sight 
 He's my angel, my whole 
 He's my gangsta loving, he's my gangsta loving 
 He's my gangsta lover, a gangsta lover, lover, lover 
 When I first met you, I ain't digging you'll want me 
 My lifestyle too hood, my music too 
 That New York bullshit yeah, I'll be on it 
 Ice cold blood, some say I'm black hearted 
 But you sorta guarded me, show me what a real love is 
 In a true romance 
 I would never leave you, you give me so much strength 
 I need you to live, and would much rather die 
 Than to be without you 
 I'm so attached to you, can't breathe without you 
 When people try to break us up, you're not caring 
 You turn they volume down cause you ain't tryina to hear it 
 They can't tell a thing about you baby 
 Look, the echelon that we on is beyond anything they wildest dreams 
 You the queen of hearts and I'm the king 
 Baby, you're the one I wanna love, the one I wanna trust 
 The one I wanna kiss, the one I wanna touch 
 And now, I only, through the haters baby 
 'Cause they put a G just to lie, I bet you keep g'd on me 
 Make me feel like I'm the only one, that you ever love 
 But you are, ever love, 
 He's my gangsta loving, he's my gangsta loving 
 He's my gangsta lover, a gangsta lover, lover, lover 
 Oh, you're gonna say some shit 
 Like he's not the one for me 
 When everynight he's here for me 
 I won't let him down, I won't never, never leave his sight 
 He's my angel, my whole 
 He's my gangsta loving, he's my gangsta loving 
 He's my gangsta lover, a gangsta lover, lover, lover
