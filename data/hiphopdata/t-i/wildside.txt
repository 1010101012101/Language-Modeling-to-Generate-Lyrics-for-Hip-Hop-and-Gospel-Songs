Smoking weed 
 Riding chrome 
 Only thing I've ever known 
 Walk on the wildside 
 Welcome to our lives 
 Swaggin' ki's 
 Spraying K's 
 Every day we getting paid 
 To walk on the wildside 
 Welcome to our lives 
 Come take a little walk with me through my neighborhood 
 And come spend a day in my trap 
 Get your paper right 
 And that yey some good 
 But you keep a tool in your lap 
 My lil patna holding that work 
 Nigga won't wait to keep around bay 
 Been that violator on my turf 
 Nigga just stage dive like that 
 (Hey, no) 
 Investigation no stating this 
 No witnesses, we ain't seen shit 
 Pull up after dawg 
 With that Guru on 
 To come see a bitch 
 That way he get it 
 We on dawg, bro, we know street lights 
 That pills to play at the fist fights 
 N'em get much to walk all night 
 We made crack pipe trying to get right 
 Midnight we shoot dykes 
 The whole house smell like concrete 
 You beat me, and you talk shit 
 You get shot bitch, and I took that 
 Hoodrats on there, they loud as all I blow 
 This shit to you might sound wild 
 But this life is all I know 
 Smoking weed 
 Riding chrome 
 Only thing I've ever known 
 Walk on the wildside 
 Welcome to our lives 
 Swaggin' ki's 
 Spraying K's 
 Every day we getting paid 
 To walk on the wildside 
 Welcome to our lives 
 (Hey) 
 Can you pitch me back in 93' 
 Bumpin' it out with Dre 
 While I hit some weed 
 Cut school, make ten G 
 Thirteen, trying to get ki 
 At fifteen, I'm a full-grown 
 Get wrong, get bust on 
 My uncle gave me a bunch of work 
 And that shit were gone by the near morning 
 You wild nigga runnin' with me 
 I'm a sigh when under her 
 Dear body with none to see 
 That pills to play, with Jeff under her 
 I were 19 with two felonies 
 One of my best friend have a life sentence 
 And my other friend, would you light me 
 Having bought your pot, we're no longer living 
 All about that cocaine deal 
 And no education, no pot to piss in 
 Old school, on chrome wheel 
 We entertain it, pills stay hidden 
 That's the shit that I come from 
 In my heart, fear ain't none 
 Stand tall, I can't run from 
 That wildside, that I smoke on 
 Smoking weed 
 Riding chrome 
 Only thing I've ever known 
 Walk on the wildside 
 Welcome to our lives 
 Swaggin' ki's 
 Spraying K's 
 Every day we getting paid 
 To walk on the wildside 
 Welcome to our lives 
 (Uh) 
 (Yeah) 
 All I ever did was pit on 
 On my old friend tryin' to get on 
 Shorty fell out, making these songs 
 Never talk down when I get home 
 Nigga's the type of nigga you can shit on 
 Unexpose, brick chrome 
 Guard body, big bone 
 That's hard body, Jim Jones 
 Nigga's know the sound on how we switch on him 
 Spend a while out when the tips on 
 Better make a toast, nigga, tip home 
 First get the bread, then get going 
 From the land of the land where they spit chrome 
 With most kids never get to live long 
 Get their pistols, get pissed on 
 Pistolwhipped and shipped, homie 
 Left for a minute and they switched on me 
 Caught them talking down, tryna bitch on me 
 And they snitch on me 
 They got shit, on me 
 So my guess is death is what they wish, on me 
 Blowing on them candles
