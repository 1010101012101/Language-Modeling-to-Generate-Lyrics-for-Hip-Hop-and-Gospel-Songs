Aye have you ever loved somebody so much you can't stand it but can't do without him? 
 Do anything for him cause you truly do adore him 
 Like dedicate songs, write poems 
 But they be on that bullshit and you try to ignore him 
 But you feel like they feel like you ain't right for him 
 Therefore your heart's torn 
 Between being with him forever, leaving him never 
 But it seem like you argue and fighting over whatever 
 Maybe we can leave, find someone better 
 Even though you will, you never know none better 
 My heart says nah, she can't leave me never 
 Been head over heels since the very day I met er 
 Feel so deep in love I ain't been able to get up 
 Sometimes I want some peace of mind 'cause she don't shut up 
 Love her to death, don't know whether to kiss er or kill er 
 Should've known it 
 From the start it was already over 
 Now we're just too dumb to notice 
 Every paper 
 Even love couldn't save us 
 We wake up 
 On a bed of guns and roses 
 And we don't know which one to choose 
 But either way, we're gonna lose 
 Stupid paper 
 Even love couldn't save us 
 We wake up 
 On a bed of guns and roses 
 Hah, I guess I'd rather suffer with her than be miserable without er 
 I ball out of Prada, Gucci, and Belinciaga 
 They keep her content, you keep down the nonsense 
 With every corner we turn, around the conflict 
 Mostly dumb shit, like who she run with? 
 Where the fuck have you been? Your pants - they don't fit 
 Really, honestly speaking, some things I don't get 
 No matter how much she try she can't make it make more sense 
 Therefore, here we go again 
 Screaming, yelling at the top of our lungs, she going in 
 Seeing the kind of shit I be like if you was a man 
 I would go in your shit, real, no shit 
 But I love her so much that I can't forget 
 That the feel of a kiss, it could heal when I'm sick 
 Still, I don't like to feel like this 
 If I wouldn't miss er, I would try to get a kill right there 
 Should've known it 
 From the start it was already over 
 Now we're just too dumb to notice 
 Every paper 
 Even love couldn't save us 
 We wake up 
 On a bed of guns and roses 
 And we don't know which one to choose 
 But either way, we're gonna lose 
 Stupid paper 
 Even love couldn't save us 
 We wake up 
 On a bed of guns and roses 
 Every time we say our goodbyes 
 A little piece of my heart breaks off inside 
 I don't really ever know why 
 If I could live without you I'd try 
 Should've known it 
 From the start it was already over 
 Now we're just too dumb to notice 
 Every paper 
 Even love couldn't save us 
 We wake up 
 On a bed of guns and roses 
 And we don't know which one to choose 
 But either way, we're gonna lose 
 Stupid paper 
 Even love couldn't save us 
 We wake up 
 On a bed of guns and roses
