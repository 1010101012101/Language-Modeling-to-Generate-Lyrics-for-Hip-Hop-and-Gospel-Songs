Young buck: 
 Uh oh, young buck, t.i., ludacris 
 Dirty south, yeah 
 I hear him talkin', but he 'bout to get that ass stomp 
 Watch, I get the club crunk, I'm'a make 'em stomp 
 We ain't playin' wanna front, you can get that ass stomp 
 Do it like them dirty south boys, do, and stomp 
 Now where you from? who the boss? I'm a break him off 
 Where you from? who the boss? lemme break him off 
 Now where you from? who the boss? I'm'a break him off 
 Where you from? who the boss? lemme break him off 
 I'm caddillac 'n' through the hood, sittin' on 24's 
 TV's playin', rim's spinin', blowin' plenty dro 
 Don't have to mention, when you pimpin', you get plenty hoes 
 It's all on you, if you goin' trick, or you goin' get yo' dough 
 I know I got these haters mad, I can love that 
 When you got love for the streets, they give ya' love back 
 Look in my eyes, you can tell I ain't never scared 
 Poppin' them thangs, I'm rockin' my chain anywhere 
 If you gon' represent your hood, what you waitin' on? 
 Security better back up, when they play this song 
 And we 'bout 50 strong, please don't make us do you wrong 
 My click of gorilla's, they got they g-unit's on 
 All of that mean muggin' really don't mean nothing 
 Come on take it outside, lemme see sumthin 
 Wha-wha-wha-what now? 
 Don't get bu-bu-bu-buck'd down 
 Stop all this hatin' or this club gon' get shu-shut down 
 Now where you from? who the boss? I'm'a break him off 
 Where you from? who the boss? lemme break him off 
 I hear him talkin', but he 'bout to get that ass stomp 
 Watch, I get the club crunk, I'm'a make 'em stomp 
 We ain't playin' wanna front, you can get that ass stomp 
 Do it like them dirty south boys, do, and stomp 
 Now where you from? who the boss? I'm'a break him off 
 Where you from? who the boss? lemme break him off 
 Now where you from? who the boss? I'm'a break him off 
 Where you from? who the boss? lemme break him off

 Aye, a 100 karots on the chest, I'm so true to this 
 Task force got my vest, I got a new bitch 
 Fans hate and talk shit, but I'm too legit 
 A million dollars at a time, till I'm super rich 
 Pimp squad, g-unit, fuck who you get 
 Ask your niece's and nephew's, I'm the shit 
 Real niggas see the diffrence between you and this 
 Me gettin' beat down?, that's ludacris 
 My name rang from the streets, and slang in my caddyville 
 Nigga are you gettin' it rodney dangerfield? 
 No respect, I'm a bet, you can bet that 
 I caught some cases, but it's just a minor set back 
 And if I have to do some time, I'll be right back 
 With some thighs, and some tri's and a six pack 
 We hit the door, watch all the pussy nigga get back 
 They know we can do it like the road, but you ain't with that 
 You know who make that track bump, like to keep it crunk 
 It's chopper's hit ya ass, you'll with ya got your ass stomp'd

 Now where you from? who the boss? I'm'a break him off 
 Where you from? who the boss? lemme break him off 
 Now where you from? who the boss? I'm'a break him off 
 Where you from? who the boss? lemme break him off 
 (Ludacris) 
 Mutherfucka, I'm a monster in this game, similar to the lachness 
 My rhymes is nappy rooted, sum verces gotta process 
 The truth in this booth, ain't no doubt when I'm rappin' 
 If I say it, I've eather done it, or it's 'bout to happen 
 When I pull up in the louis truck on 26's, people dumb out 
 If lifes a crack game, I'm rollin' 7's on the come out 
 These rapper's think I'm ig-nent, love sayin' my name 
 'Cause maintainin my fish tank, and they house, cost the same 
 Ask me, I'd say I made it, and it sure wasn't luck 
 'Cause hustler's relate to me, and some are younger than buck 
 You see I'm married to my music, but we got a prenupt 
 So if that bitch don't act right, I'm still gettin' my cut 
 My deals never get screwed, my contracts practice abstinence 
 I'm masterin this program, hazin' these undergraduates 
 So, pimpin' be easy, quit catchin' feelings 
 'Cause you worth a couple hundred grand, and I'm worth millions 
 Nobodies thinkin' about you, plus your beats ain't legit 
 So please stay off the t.i.p. of my dick
