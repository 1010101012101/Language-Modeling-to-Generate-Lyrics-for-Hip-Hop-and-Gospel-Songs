Our Father who are in Heaven 
 Hollowed be thy name, Thy kingdom come 
 Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven 
 Give us this day, our daily bread 
 And forgive us for our trespasses 
 As we forgive those who trespass against us 
 Lead us not into temptation 
 But deliver us from evil 
 For Thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory 
 For ever, and ever, amen 
 Man I'm prayin' for help 
 While I'm lookin' at the life I left 
 It's kind'a hard not to hate myself 
 But quiet is kept right or wrong 
 It's just the way I felt 
 I might be better of prayin' for death 
 On my knees I knelt 
 Still trying to find a way to accept 
 It ain't a way I can help nobody 
 Till I save myself technically I'm still a slave myself 
 I gotta climb out the grave myself 
 Man I played myself 
 But when I look at all the fans I touched 
 I ask how can a man that's done so much 
 Be treated so unjust 'cause I'm tryin' to inspire da folks 
 Wanna condemn 'cause they sell dope 
 Well, man show 'em the ropes 
 Be a father a football coach a role model or a symbol of hope 
 Take another approach 
 Instead of testifying against 'em in court 
 Handcuffin' 'em and closin' the door 
 So they can be worse than before 
 Can't you see they only do what they know 
 Then you wonder why they don't care no more 
 Life ain't fair I know but why I'm hated everywhere I go 
 Next time you wanna compare my flow just know 
 I'm prayin' for help, askin' somebody else to give me a hand 
 I'm tryin' hard but I'm only a man 
 Man, I'm prayin' for help 
 Hopin' somebody else can see what I see 
 It's like the hood only matter to me they got me prayin' for help 
 Hopin' somebody else can carry the torch 
 I'm all alone with no kinda support 
 While I was prayin' for help 
 Realized I don't need nobody else 
 If God with me I can do it myself 
 Tired of just prayin' for help 
 I know it's only one king 
 One thing, one being, only something I believe 
 Without seein' and with all my faith 
 I pray somehow, someway regardless of what anyone say 
 I believe one day that I'm a change my life 
 Get right, start livin' like Christ, till the end of my fight 
 I'm a be defending my strife 
 Till somebody come and shut off my lights 
 I ain't never gone quit 
 No matter how difficult is gonna get 
 And you can bet whatever on this 
 I'm forever gone spit 
 Harder than niggaz hatin' on TIP 
 You can take the weight and place it on TIP 
 I'll double my load carry it as the trouble unfolds 
 Hold yo and I bet I don't fold 
 Put that on my soul 
 If it takes till I'm 100 years old 
 Bet I'm reachin' every one of my goals 
 You know I'm prayin' for help 
 Askin' somebody else to give me a hand 
 I'm tryin' hard but I'm only a man 
 Man, I'm prayin' for help 
 Hopin' somebody else can see what I see 
 It's like the hood only matter to me they got me prayin' for help 
 Hopin' somebody else can carry the torch 
 I'm all alone with no kinda support 
 While I was prayin' for help 
 Realized I don't need nobody else 
 If God with me I can do it myself 
 Tired of just prayin' for help 
 So many times I done wish that I could change my mind 
 Change my life and leave the game behind 
 And it's been so many days 
 I done prayed I could find a way 
 Find the heart and the time to say 
 Only so many are blessed with 
 So many chances, so many checks 
 So many fans with so many arrests 
 And it's been so many deaths 
 So many prisons with niggaz in there 
 And the system keep playin' them to the left 
 Man it's so many test so many haters love seein' you stress 
 But tribulations come with being the best 
 Still there's so many reflects, singin' 'bout Tecs 
 Winnin', green and the trickz? 
 Sellin' dreams that never seen in the jex? 
 That's why I'm seen as a threat 
 So many stripes off the streets in my vest 
 So many rappers get so little respect 
 Man niggaz faith on the shelf 
 'Cause of the cards that a nigga was dealt 
 Or the hard that a nigga done dealt 
 So many niggaz that left out of the hood 
 Made a way for theyself 
 Instead of givi' back they stay for theyself 
 So many playin' theyself 
 Instead of reading educating theyselves 
 The ones who won't pray for theyself 
 They got me prayin' for help 
 Askin' somebody else to give me a hand 
 I'm tryin' hard but I'm only a man 
 Man, I'm prayin' for help 
 Hopin' somebody else can see what I see 
 It's like the hood only matter to me 
 They got me prayin' for help 
 Hopin' somebody else can carry the torch 
 I'm all alone with no kinda support 
 While I was prayin' for help 
 Realized I don't need nobody else 
 If God with me I can do it myself 
 Tired of just prayin' for help 
 Prayin' for help, prayin' for help
