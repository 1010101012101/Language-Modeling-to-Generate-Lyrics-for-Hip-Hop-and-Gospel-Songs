It's Okay 
 Tomorrow'll be a better day 
 When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight 
 But the only way to get it is to slang that weight 
 Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day 
 Came in the world with a sparkle in her eye 
 And knowing the only thing that we can promise is we die 
 But a promise is a lot can't nobody guarantee it 
 And death around the corner can't nobody damn see it 
 I can't agree that God good at all time 
 But we all know shit ain't all good at all time 
 So I tote my strap in the hood and all time 
 But respect ain't just something that's understood in our time 
 Especially by our kind man I hate it for the future 
 Police don't wanna lock ya up no more they wanna shoot ya 
 Ain't as half as bad as these hatas'll do ya 
 As soon as ya get ya loot up they wanna shoot off 
 Lord forbid to kill me I bet ya nobody knew what 
 Suckas get shot and police come straight to us 
 Imagine how they do us ever say niggas blew up 
 I know ya goin' through it know I'm goin' through it too 
 When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight 
 But the only way to get it is to slang that weight 
 Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day 
 When ya daughter like 6 and her pops ain't shit 
 You ain't wanna tell her you and momma gotta go strip 
 Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day 
 I'm doin' this for the hood for a kid with no dad 
 I was just like y'all don't feel so bad 
 Know it's hard when ya live so bad 
 They whoop ya ass and they wonder why ya still so bad 
 For long ya get whoopin's and just laugh 
 Momma washin' clothes behind lil' blue bag 
 She ask what ya what ya doin' ya tell her stuntin' like my daddy 
 You knew that I was gonna be a hustla when ya had me 
 Look around ma you sent me to the sto' to get some bread 
 And I'm passin' atleast 8 J's or mo' 
 Rent been late for 8 days or mo' 
 But slangin' blow ain't as bad habit than 8 days of snow 
 When ya speeding with the white and ya see the blue lights 
 And ya on ya 3rd strike so the judge say life 
 Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day 
 If ya son 14 and his dad is a criminal 
 Workin' to realize Baby girl goin' witcha tho 
 Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day 
 My momma girl son 14 just got killed 
 Had to help myself 
 Bout to tell her I know how ya feel 
 I'd a been a damn liar 
 See her tryin' not to cry 
 She know he in a better place 
 But she just wanna know why 
 Know somebody tellin' lie 
 If a nigga gon' die 
 It's goin' down 
 I guarantee I'm gonna calm down 
 I tried to convince her that he in God's arms now 
 She said I don't believe in this God right now 
 I know it's hard right now in ya heart right now 
 But God can help ya feelin's if ya start right now 
 You can start right now cause you report right now 
 Shit you in better shape than we are right now 
 When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight 
 But the only way to get it is to slang that weight 
 Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day 
 When ya daughter like 6 and her pops ain't shit 
 You ain't wanna tell her you and momma gotta go strip 
 Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day 
 When ya speeding with the white and ya see the blue lights 
 And ya on ya 3rd strike so the judge say life 
 Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day 
 If ya son 14 and his dad is a criminal 
 Workin' to realize Baby girl goin' witcha tho 
 Okay, tomorrow'll be a better day
