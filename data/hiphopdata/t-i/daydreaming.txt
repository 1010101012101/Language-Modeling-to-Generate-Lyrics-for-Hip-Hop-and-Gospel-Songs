Dj Drama, Akon 
 T.I. Snoop Dogg 
 Shirley temple on ice, she makes it just right 
 That extra grenadine got me feelin' so nice 
 Her body's so tight up under that light 
 I see her so clearly now 
 She's right there before my eyes 
 Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer 
 She got me wanderin' now 
 Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer, yeah 
 She got me daydreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, at night) 
 Yes, I'm daydreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, at night) 
 She got me daydreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, at night) 
 Yes, I'm daydreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, at night) 
 5 foot 8, on the late what a date 
 She fell for the hook and the bait 
 I took her to the yacht, the shrimp and steak 
 Then I took her to the gym 
 So she could get in shape, what a night 
 No more drama, just late night thrills 
 Nigga in the hood with the gangsta grillz 
 Fillin' out stacks of bills, Jaguar like Jacksonville 
 Bringing these hoes like Jacks and Jill 
 Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer 
 She got me wander'n now 
 Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer 
 She got me daydreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, at night) 
 Yes, I'm daydreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, at night) 
 She got me daydreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, at night) 
 Yes, I'm daydreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, at night) 
 I'm looking at the most beautiful thang in the world 
 Her body's so perfect and spinin' like a cinnamon swirl 
 She looks like a fairy tale but yet feels so natural 
 This one's a beast but way to wonderful 
 To be compared to an animal 
 She's like what I'm sippin' on 
 Shirley temple on ice, she makes it just right 
 That extra grenadine got me feelin' so nice 
 Her body's so tight up under that light 
 I see her so clearly now 
 She's right there before my eyes 
 Hey, I sit and gaze hazy eyed as I day dream 
 Her and her girls on the stage doin' they thing 
 Double D's full of silicon and saline 
 She thirty but look only a day over 18 
 Her booty big enough to swallow up a G-string 
 Hey, gon' put that ass on me like a bee sting 
 Hey, let the King on, beat it like a tambourine 
 And peel ya out ya jeans and eat it like a tangerine 
 Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer 
 She got me wander'n now 
 Can you believe my fantasy girl is a go-go dancer, yeah 
 She got me daydreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, at night) 
 Yes, I'm daydreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, at night) 
 She got me daydreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, at night) 
 Yes, I'm daydreamin' 
 (Left and right, watch her goin' up and down, at night)
