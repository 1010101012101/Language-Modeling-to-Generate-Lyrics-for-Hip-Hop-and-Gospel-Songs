(Feat. Rihanna) 
 What you need to do is be thankful for the life that you got. 
 You know what I'm sayin'. 
 Stop lookin' at what you ain't got 
 And start bein' thankful for what you do got. 
 Let's give it to 'em baby girl. 
 You're gonna be a shining star 
 With fancy clothes and fancy ca-ars 
 And then you'll see, you're gonna go far 
 'Cause everyone knows who you a-are 
 So live your life (ay), ay ay ay 
 Instead of chasing that paper 
 Just live your life (oh), ay ay ay 
 Ain't got no time for no haters 
 Just live your life (ay), ay ay ay 
 No telling where it'll take ya 
 Just live your life (oh), ay ay ay 
 'Cause I'm a paper chaser 
 Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh) 
 Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh) 
 Never mind what haters say, ignore 'em till they fade away 
 Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away 
 Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today 
 You'd still be wasting days away, now had I never saved the day 
 Consider them my protégé, homage I think they should pay 
 Instead of being gracious they violate in a major way 
 I never been a hater still I love them in a crazy way 
 Some say they sold yay and no they couldn't get work on Labor day 
 It ain't that they black or white, it has an area the shade of grey 
 I'm west side anyway, even if I left today and stayed away 
 Some move away to make a way, not move away 'cause they afraid 
 I brought back to the hood and all you ever did was take away 
 I pray for patience but they make me want to melt their face away 
 Like I once made them spray, now I could make 'em put the K's away 
 Been thugging all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break 
 You would rather see me catch a case and watch my future fade away 
 You're gonna be a shining star 
 With fancy clothes and fancy ca-ars 
 And then you'll see, you're gonna go far 
 'Cause everyone knows who you a-are 
 So live your life (ay), ay ay ay 
 Instead of chasing that paper 
 Just live your life (oh), ay ay ay 
 Ain't got no time for no haters 
 Just live your life (ay), ay ay ay 
 No telling where it'll take ya 
 Just live your life (oh), ay ay ay 
 'Cause I'm a paper chaser 
 Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh) 
 Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh) 
 I'm the opposite of moderate 
 Immaculately polished with the spirit of a hustler and the swagger of a college kid 
 Allergic to the counterfeit, impartial to the politics 
 Articulate but still I'll grab a nigga by the collar quick 
 Whoever having problems with their record sales just holla T.I.P. 
 If that don't work and all else fails then turn around and follow T.I.P. 
 I got love for the game but ay I'm not in love with all of it 
 Could do without the fame and rappers nowadays are comedy 
 The hooting and the hollering, back and forth with the arguing 
 Where you from, who you know, what you make and what kind of car you in 
 Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositing 
 Them checks into your bank account and you up out of poverty 
 Your values is in disarray, prioritizing horribly 
 Unhappy with the riches 'cause you piss poor morally 
 Ignoring all prior advice and fore warning 
 And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we? 
 You're gonna be a shining star 
 With fancy clothes and fancy ca-ars 
 And then you'll see, you're gonna go far 
 'Cause everyone knows who you a-are 
 So live your life (ay), ay ay ay 
 Instead of chasing that paper 
 Just live your life (oh), ay ay ay 
 Ain't got no time for no haters 
 Just live your life (ay), ay ay ay 
 No telling where it'll take ya 
 Just live your life (oh), ay ay ay 
 'Cause I'm a paper chaser 
 Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh) 
 Just living my life (ay), my life (oh), my life (ay), my life (oh) 
 Got everybody watching what I do 
 Come walk in my shoes 
 And see the way I'm living if you really want to 
 Got my mind on my money and I'm not going nowhere 
 So keep on getting your paper and keep on climbing 
 Look in the mirror and keep on shining 
 Till the game ends, till the clock stops 
 We gon' post up on the top spot 
 Living the life, the life 
 In a brand new city got my whole team with me 
 The life, my life 
 I do what I wanna do 
 I'm living my life, my life 
 I will never lose, 
 I'm living my life, my life 
 And I'm not stopping 
 So live your life!
