Don't forget 
 To Remember me (ay don't forget Shawty) 
 I'll be back - so remember me 
 Please keep me in your heart 
 If we have to ever part 
 Don't forget me, to remember me 
 The king Marley day Martin Luther Malcolm X 
 I'm officially the freshest, don't dare forget I'm gone 
 Momentarily don't bury me yet like Ali 
 Got I got the title back prepare for that 
 When the world needed Tip, ask where was he at? 
 But when he need some back - fade to black 
 Talk - behind his back, you a hater for that 
 I don't respect noneless, in the game of chess 
 You think five moves ahead, and not behind 
 Jumped up and cheered when I got my time 
 Like yeah, one more year I got to grind 
 But get me losin off your mind, Short may I remind you 
 That there ain't another who done been through 
 What I been through 
 Time after time again 
 You better get some in you 
 When you said, it was over for him and you thought it 
 Couldn't continue to floss 
 Here's to your memory loss, Sucka 
 Don't forget 
 To Remember me (ay don't forget Shawty) 
 I'll be back - so remember me 
 Please keep me in your heart 
 If we have to ever part 
 Don't forget me, to remember me 
 They say: out of sight, out of mind 
 9 times out of 10 men out of pocket - out of line 
 You do it big, everybody that you outshined 
 Y'old lady fate talk about how he got fine 
 She say she tryin' to get away, he say "About time" 
 Right now, we all thinkin' "Damn, hoping not mine." 
 But when it's lights out for you 
 And you locked down 
 Ain't no telling whether or not 
 Your lady went and got down 
 With that... town 'cause he hot now 
 Ripping up your love letters, 
 Lifting up her night gown 
 Right now somebody baby momma getting piped down 
 Kids in the next room listening "Mama, pipe down" 
 The thought hurt don't it? 
 But maybe she's strong enough 
 Or ain't get that lonely 
 'Cause you wasn't gone long enough 
 Trust, it's just a temporarily setback 
 It's on when I get back 
 Please don't remember that 
 Don't forget 
 To Remember me (ay don't forget Shawty) 
 I'll be back - so remember me 
 Please keep me in your heart 
 If we have to ever part 
 Don't forget me, to remember me 
 I don't mean to feel like this 
 Don't mean to think like this 
 My heart just has to be sure 
 That the love that I give to you 
 That's the love that I get from you 
 I need to be safe and secure 
 Don't forget 
 To Remember me (ay don't forget Shawty) 
 I'll be back - so remember me 
 Please keep me in your heart 
 If we have to ever part 
 Don't forget me, to remember me 
 Don't you forget about me
