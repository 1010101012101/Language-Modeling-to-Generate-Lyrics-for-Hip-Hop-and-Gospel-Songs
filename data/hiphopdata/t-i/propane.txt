Wow (yeah) look at all this money (I see it) 
 I bet you like how that hits your forehead huh?(it's the king partna) 
 Doe money, street money 
 I'm a boss bitch 
 I tell you what... 
 Chorus: I'm on a tour an exotic dreams (dreams) 
 From club to club I'm making it rain (rain) 
 I'm here so much that y'all know my name 
 I'm so on fire they call me Mr.Propane 
 Me and my three amigos to magic city we go 
 We know all this money 
 We throw we gone probably bruise some egos 
 And all this louie v so fly 
 Look like we moving kilos 
 Came with three chicks and 
 Left with two or three more 
 Verse: ha ha aha 
 50 large and a rubber band 
 Pick a bunch of broads and let 'em dance and let 'em stand to the side or what ever man 
 Some light some dark some cinnamon (I like you) 
 I bought a bottle from the bar like a gentlemen four door five more I can get them in 
 Man haters in the corner like whatever man can go where ever man seen me where we can rain on the weather man 
 Chorus: I'm on the tour and exotic dreams (dreams) 
 From club to club I'm making it rain (rain) 
 I'm here so much that y'all know my name 
 I'm so on fire they call me Mr.Propane 
 (It's the king bi*tch) 
 Okay ready set fall

 Why shoulda pick and choose when I can just get 'em all 
 Let them fat cats eat my big dog I be in waitin the parking lot just call in a drop top ghetto drop then fall 
 Looking hot enough to get ya lot pissed off I'm so fly I'm so raw to the point that it seens like I'm fronting and showing off remember I told y'all I'm out of control y'all

 Chorus: I'm on the tour and exotic dreams (dreams)

 Chorus: I'm on the tour and exotic dreams (dreams) 
 From club to clubs I'm making it rain (rain)
