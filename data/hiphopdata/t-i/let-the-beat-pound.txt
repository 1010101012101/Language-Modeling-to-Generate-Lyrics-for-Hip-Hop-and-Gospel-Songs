People see me in the street now 
 They wave at me and they ask me turn my beat down 
 Turn my beat down, turn my beat down 
 I tell 'em never I forever let my beat pound 
 I keep my speakers in the trunk just like that yay 
 Everybody where I'm from like that like that bass 
 Just can't wait till I get a whoopty just to ride through the hood 
 Buy theyself an amp and hook some woofers up to it 
 If your motor running good and your 808 bumpin 
 That's all that really matter you can't tell a nigga nothing 
 Nevermind what you ride when its dark outside 
 When there's broads outside, you just park outside 
 Pop your trunk and cut your music up loud 
 Now watch 'em crowd around bet they dig a nigga now 
 And my beat down low and my top laid back 
 Now cut it to the max like I never said that (hey) 
 People see me in the street now 
 They wave at me and they ask me turn my beat down 
 Turn my beat down, turn my beat down 
 I tell 'em never I forever let my beat pound (hey) 
 Police ask to turn my beat down 
 He let me go, I turn the corner let my beat pound 
 Turn my beat down, wont turn my beat down 
 I tell 'em never I forever let my beat pound 
 When my girl ride with me, gotta cover my seat 
 'Cause that thang go to skeetin, when I cut up my beat 
 Pumpin something Grand Hustle in a 96 bubble 
 Even amplify my tweeters so my music ain't muffled 
 Your ass in trouble if you pull up next to me 
 When its really up high you can't hear yourself think 
 Cause my speaker box the biggest trunk sound like a midget 
 Tryna get up out of there 15's stay hittin 
 We be coming from a distance out of everbodys vision 
 It don't matter what I'm playing, I make everybody listen 
 See I'm turning around wondering how I get so loud 
 Ears ringing all day 'cause my shit so loud 
 People see me in the street now 
 They wave at me and they ask to turn my beat down 
 Turn my beat down, turn my beat down 
 I tell 'em never I forever let my beat pound 
 Police ask me turn my beat down 
 He let me go, I turn the corner let my beat pound 
 Turn my beat down, wont turn my beat down 
 I tell 'em never I forever let my beat pound 
 When I pull up to the light and my shit so high 
 People mad I don't see them 'cause I'm sitting so high 
 Looking at me like they stupid they can't hear there own music 
 But ain't nothing they can do they just gotta listen to it 
 Jackie chan in my trunk just like young dro 
 I love that song cut the bass so low 
 It be setting off alarms 
 Sound like I drop bombs 
 Pumpin trick www . DUB . com 
 R.I.P. pimp c number 3 ridin' dirty 
 Own it first I cut it up and make sure everybody heard it 
 Chevy swerving bumping young jeezy bottom of the map 
 Best believe me when you hear me say I got it in my lap 
 In the trap bumpin old B gizzle hot boy 
 Old lady on the porch holling what is that noise 
 People asking me to cut it off 
 I roll my window down and I tell 'em it ain't nothing y'all 
 People see me in the street now 
 They wave at me and they ask me turn my beat down 
 Turn my beat down, turn my beat down 
 I tell 'em never I forever let my beat pound
