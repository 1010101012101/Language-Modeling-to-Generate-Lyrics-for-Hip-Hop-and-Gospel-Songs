Uh yeah 
 Uh oh oh 
 I hope you don't mind 
 I hope you don't mind 
 That I put down in words 
 How wonderful life like 
 Aye Trill, lemme holla atcha 
 Making yo momma proud, looking in yo daughter's eyes 
 Kickin the riches son's trippin', never realize 
 How you got him? They're so wrapped up in yo losses 
 You couldn't the profits 'cause they'll be in the projects 
 It's definitely some projects just poppin' when niggas floppin 
 Some of you went back to prison, tipic, coulda been a coffee 
 Now since we talkin' you be trippin' never since like that 
 Appreciate you listened me but G, you still alive 
 I'm lookin' down at you, and sendin smiles to you 
 I check the record now, oh tell to me get high with you 
 Told you she would get you, that's good cause shorty proud with you 
 Kids getting big, same king right into my circle 
 So meet me drive a car, see bubble triggers you 
 I see the money reppin, and he's thinkin' too 
 The days are beautiful, and major supercool 
 My life is over with y'all, your life is good to you 
 And you can tell everybody 
 This is your song 
 And you can tell everybody 
 This is your song 
 I hope you don't mind 
 I hope you don't mind 
 That I put down in words 
 How wonderful life like 
 Sit down, son 
 And listen to me son, and pay attention to me 
 Seems like I'm the only one that you would listen to 
 I never knew the time that ain't get to spare with you 
 Would ever resolve in you making yourself miserable 
 You gotta let it go, it's painful, I already know 
 Pastors to playas, just learn from the grown 
 So you got crystal with you? And your sister precious too 
 I'm proud of you, did better than I expected you to 
 Although I knew you was special when you was smaller 
 That's why I was so much harder on you, knew you were smaller 
 That much come for the offer, I wasn't much of a talker 
 Great to see you doin' better than me, even as a father 
 Take good care of yo mama, overcoming the drama 
 Your life is wonderful sir, don't let 'em take it from you 
 Keep living it to the fullest, treasure it, it's a blessing 
 Be thankful for all this beauty, when it's over with forget it 
 And you can tell everybody 
 This is your song 
 (This is your song) 
 And you can tell everybody 
 This is your song 
 (Said This is your song) 
 I hope you don't mind 
 I hope you don't mind 
 That I put down in words 
 How wonderful life like 
 Damn 
 What up, Feena? So good to hear from you, we missing you 
 Remembering all of our conversations, they be reminiscing you 
 The good the day they low, could tell they don't know who they listen to 
 Today I watch Jeanette like she was my own and that could missing you 
 I swear it's so unfair that I'm right here and you up there 
 I miss you so much and after the point I call your name but you not there 
 Now I can't rest and I can't do shit 
 Off my mind, I'm so upset 
 It wasn't your time to beat me there 
 Broke my heart to see you there 
 Shot with bullets that were meant for me, families never forgiving me 
 I knew, but all I could do was follow your memory 
 But pops I thank you so much for living, I had to grow up 
 Slinging crack on the corner ain't quite the future you wanted for me 
 Was it? And this pain I feel it never goes away 
 Does it? This load I carry get no lighter 
 I grew up all on my own with a broken heart and a broken home 
 Taught me everything I've known 
 Owe you everything I own 
 I must admit you raised a warrior, my life could be a story book 
 Hope you proud of me, didn't graduate from college but 
 Thanks for listening to me, 
 So long, I had this problem dog 
 Till we meet in person let's keep speaking through my verses for life 
 And you can tell everybody 
 This is your song 
 (This is your song) 
 And you can tell everybody 
 This is your song 
 (Said This is your song) 
 I hope you don't mind 
 I hope you don't mind 
 That I put down in words 
 How wonderful life like
