West Side, nigga 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey 
 I got my 44's, and my dro 
 And my Chevy on 24's 
 And my hoe, now where I s'posed to go 
 T.I.: 
 See me ridin' in a Chevy, 44 on the seat 
 With a quarter o' of blow gettin' loaded wit C 
 No tags, no license, the trunk loaded with D 
 Ridin' Fulton in D where we know it to be 
 They pull us over, you think I'm stoppin', you must be fuckin' wit me 
 If they don't want to die tonight, they best stop fuckin' wit me 
 I'm'a pull over in Bowen Homes, my cousin and me 
 And they gon' hide me in they home while they lookin' for me 
 Big Kuntry: 
 We the neighborhood superstars, pimp a Chevy pullin' hard 
 Thousand dollars worth of dimes in the trunk with rockstars 
 We puttin' fear in cowards hearts when they see us on the block 
 Swirvin' in the deuce and quarter, bustin' shots just because 
 The hell I care about gettin' caught? I'm makin' bail by 12 o'clock 
 Back in the spot with the same old serve and drop 
 I pull a hoe in Bangkok, drop her off at TIP's spot 
 I'm burnin' rubber, fuck the cops, another day on my block 
 I got my 44's, and my dro 
 And my Chevy on 24's 
 And my hoe, now where I s'posed to go 
 Mac Boney: 
 I'm Cadillac daddy, pulled up on some hoes from ol' Natty 
 I said I'm Pimp Squad hoe what's happenin'? 
 Westside get them panties snappin' 
 She asked me can I do the Laffy Taffy 
 I said I do to make the pussy happy 
 Let's get a room over on Virginia 
 Step inside a suite and then continue 
 You in for a lil fender bender 
 Baby just remember make it quick 
 You niggas kinda know me I'm the shit 
 C-Rod: 
 I'm the in the bubble kush Chevy 
 Well at least that's what it smells like 
 Hit the gas, poof, fire blowin' out the tailpipe 
 Tailpipe that's all these hoes wanna lick for the night 
 Treat them like Tina, beat the pussy, and ya call me Ike 
 That's right, monster ride sittin' on the 28's 
 Sounds like a stadium, you would've thought the Braves played 
 The engine runnin' like Vick, with the Falcons on the hood 
 Mr., Mr. Westside, yeah, you know they in my hood 
 I got my 44's, and my dro 
 And my Chevy on 24's 
 And my hoe, now where I s'posed to go 
 AK: 
 Ain't no tellin' where I'm goin', 'less I'm steppin' out 
 Sittin' on the high life, windows up in the clouds 
 Open up the console, that's where I got my gun 
 Right next to that, get the bag and roll another one 
 I got vitamins, make a freak fuck all night 
 Hoes know, killers on the Westside earn stripes 
 Make that money turn bright, just look at my piece and my grill 
 Swirvin' off Church St., the pimp God gave me skills 
 Young Dro: 
 I was born up in Bankhead, y'all remember me 
 Way back in 83', T.I. stayed on the street from me 
 Just 'cause I'm from Bankhead, niggas having beef wit me 
 Half never seen a G in the cab of my Beamer V 
 Ten screens fallin' in my Chevy watchin' Lean on Me 
 Ridin' down Simpson, bout to waste my purple lean on me 
 Purple linen clean on me, the whole zone 3 on me 
 Waffle House Charger, yellow-black I got a bee on me 
 I got my 44's, and my dro 
 And my Chevy on 24's 
 And my hoe, now where I s'posed to go
