Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my... 
 If I wrote you a symphony 
 Just to say how much you mean to me 
 (What would you do?) 
 If I told you you were beautiful 
 Would you date me on the regular? 
 (Tell me, would you?) 
 Well, baby, I've been around the world 
 But I ain't seen myself another girl (like you) 
 This ring here represents my heart 
 But there is just one thing I need from you 
 (Say it, I do) 
 Because I can see us holding hands 
 Walking on the beach, our clothes in the sand 
 I can see us on the country side 
 Sittin' on the grass, laying side by side 
 You can be my baby 
 Let me make you my lady 
 Girl, you amaze me 
 Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy 
 See, all I want you to do is be my love 
 So don't give away, my love 
 So don't give away, my love 
 So don't give away 
 Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love 
 So don't give away, my love 
 So don't give away, my love 
 So don't give away 
 Ain't another woman that could take your spot 
 My love, love 
 My love 
 My love 
 Now, if I wrote you a love note 
 And made you smile at every word I wrote 
 (What would you do?) 
 Would that make you wanna change your scene 
 And wanna be the one on my team? 
 (Tell me, would you?) 
 See, what's the point in waitin' anymore? 
 'Cause, girl, I never been more sure 
 (That, baby, it's you) 
 This ring here represents my heart 
 And everything that you been waiting for 
 (Just say it, I do) 
 So don't give away, my love 
 So don't give away, my love 
 So don't give away 
 Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love 
 So don't give away, my love 
 So don't give away, my love 
 So don't give away 
 Ain't another woman that could take your spot 
 My love, love 
 My love (Aight, it's time to hit it J.T.) 
 My love (I dunno why she hesitatin' for, man) 
 Eh, shorty cool as a fan 
 On the new once again 
 And he still have fans from Peru to Japan 
 Listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan 
 But if you got a man try to lose 'em if you can 
 'Cause the girls real wild throw their hands up high 
 When they wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy 
 You don't really wanna let the chance go by 
 'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly 
 Baby, friend so fly I can go fly 
 Private 'cause I handle my B.I. 
 They call me candle guy 
 Simply 'cause I am on fire 
 I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny 
 I'm patient, but I ain't gon try 
 You don't come, I ain't gon die 
 Hold up what you mean you can't go, why? 
 Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie 
 You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high 
 Well, baby, it's obvious that I ain't your guy 
 I ain't gon lie 
 I feel your space 
 But forget your face, I swear I will 
 St. Bart's, Anguilla, anywhere I chill 
 Just bring wit' me a pair, I will 
 Come on, 
 I can see us holding hands 
 Walking on the beach, our clothes in the sand 
 I can see us on the country side 
 Sitting on the grass, laying side by side 
 You can be my baby 
 Let me make you my lady 
 Girl, you amaze me 
 Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy 
 See, all I want you to do is be my love, love 
 My love, love 
 My love, love 
 Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love, love 
 My love, love 
 My love, love 
 Ain't another woman that could take your spot 
 My love, love 
 My love, my love
