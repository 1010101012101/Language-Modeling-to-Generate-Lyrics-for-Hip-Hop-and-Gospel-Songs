Follow your dreams don't give up 
 Don't ever listen when they tell you you're gonna be a failure 
 Follow your dreams don't give up 
 Remember anything is possible, believe is all you gotta do 
 Please don't give up 
 Don't ever let them tell you what you can't do just because they ain't you 
 Believe in yourself that's enough 
 The sky is the limit if you want it all you gotta do is get it homie 
 This is a message to the youth 
 Remember you can do anything you pursue 
 Look at me, I'm living proof 
 It's a piece of me in you, it's not a lot that's different 'bout us 
 Nobody ever thought I'd live to see a million dollars 
 Remember I was hustlin just to fix up my Impala 
 And now you ought to see the rides I hop up outta 
 Convertible Mercedes, look at haters like holla 
 Reclining terra cotta, I don't owe you guys notta 
 All they get is second hand as I pass by 
 I'm that fly, so they go hatin' I don't ask why 
 Hey nevermind, keep your head to the sky dog 
 Remember nothing beats a failure but a try dog 
 Don't listen to them when they say it can't happen 
 Let it go in this ear and right out that one 
 Just keep mashing on them, laughing 
 Soon you'll be passing all they broke asses 
 Better than you imagined 
 Follow your dreams don't give up 
 Don't ever listen when they tell you you're gonna be a failure 
 Follow your dreams don't give up 
 Remember anything is possible, believe is all you gotta do 
 Please don't give up 
 Don't ever let them tell you what you can't do just because they ain't you 
 Believe in yourself that's enough 
 The sky is the limit if you want it all you gotta do is get it homie 
 Same message on the second, continued from verse one 
 You let them trick you out of your dreams the worse done 
 The only purpose for some is to take your eyes off the prize 
 And to keep you from succeeding see they willing to die 
 Let's say one day you cross paths end up killing a guy 
 Never make it, go to the penn now you letting him win 
 Man now here he is with a big ass grin 
 Laughing at you from the grave cause you ain't get paid 
 The same ones that call you a sucka today 
 Laugh at you tomorrow when the feds take you away 
 Listen, once upon a time there was a guy name Jay 
 He will never make managing TI they say 
 He'd quit right then if they had they way 
 Instead he quit his job, hustled hard, night and day 
 Dropped an album on his artist although no one ever heard of him 
 Minus sales but the mixtapes murdered em 
 Got on a label, sent the hatas home inspired 
 Turned Grand Hustle into an empire 
 And poof, out the hood he blew 
 If not me Jay Jeter, that could be you 
 Remember 
 Follow your dreams don't give up 
 Don't ever listen when they tell you you're gonna be a failure 
 Follow your dreams don't give up 
 Remember anything is possible, believe is all you gotta do 
 Please don't give up 
 Don't ever let them tell you what you can't do just because they ain't you 
 Believe in yourself that's enough 
 The sky is the limit if you want it all you gotta do is get it homie
