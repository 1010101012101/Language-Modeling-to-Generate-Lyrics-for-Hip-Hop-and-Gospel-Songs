Hate the price of fame, it cost to much 
 These niggas talk to much 
 I'm ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em 
 Boy, I'm ready for whatever 
 Hey, hey, hey 
 Even though my head in the clouds, I'm planted on the pavement 
 How I'm walkin' 'round, people starin' in amazement 
 I play a lot of games, but well-being I ain't playing wit' 
 They so judgmental, man, but they don't understand 
 If ya life was in jeopardy everyday, is you tellin' me 
 You wouldn't need weaponry just because of ya felonies? 
 Consider this at least, I got everybody sweatin' me 
 On the streets is people who won't rest unless I rest in peace 
 Killed my folk a year ago, still, in my sleep they threaten me 
 Paranoia stressin' me, ain't nobody protectin' me 
 I'm dealing wit' the pressure from my partner dyin' next to me 
 Think 'cause no one's arrested, they comin' for me eventually 
 This was all the things that I was goin' through mentally 
 This could be the reason I ignored the penitentiary 
 Not mentionin' New Orleans, niggas comin' in the city 
 Killin' all summer long, ain't nobody pay attention 
 Now is it that hard to understand if ya listen? 
 Either die or go to jail, that's a hell of decision 
 But I'm wrong and I know it, my excuse is unimportant 
 I'm just tryin' to let you know that I ain't think I had a choice, for real 
 I had straps in my ride, gotta go to prison 
 You waitin' on me to die, you gon' be waitin' for a minute 
 Boy, I'm ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em 
 I be here when the smoke clear and everything settle for real 
 Can't afford the price of fame 'cause it cost too much 
 Plus these sucka niggas lame and they talk to much 
 That's why I'm ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em 
 I be here when the smoke clear and everything settle for real 
 For real, ay, for real 
 I say, when everything settle for real 
 Ay, for real, ay, for real 
 I say, when everything settle for real 
 I'm a man, I ain't perfect, I admit it, I'm guilty 
 But understand, feel me, I was ridin' filthy 
 'Cause niggas out there plottin' to rob me and kill me 
 500,000 every year spent on security 
 My future was bright, but now its gettin' blurry 
 'Cause niggas in a hurry to find me and bury me 
 But surely, God'll deliver me up out it 
 I'm a fighter to the heart, I'll forever be about it 
 I'm a father to my sons, asset to my community 
 Look all that I done done, my good outweigh the negativity 
 'Ay mentally, I was focused on not lettin' history repeat itself 
 That's why heat was kept in the vicinity 
 Yes, officially, I broke the law, but not maliciously 
 Through all of the publicity, was anyone considerin' 
 My position and the logic hid in my decision? 
 But they caught me wit 'em, now I'm off to prison, period 
 But is it that hard to understand if ya listen? 
 Either die or go to jail, that's a hell of decision 
 But I'm wrong and I know it, my excuse is unimportant 
 I'm just tryin' to let you know that I ain't think I had a choice, for real 
 I had straps in my ride, gotta go to prison 
 You waitin' on me to die, you gon' be waitin' for a minute 
 Boy, I'm ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em 
 I be here when the smoke clear and everything settle for real 
 Can't afford the price of fame 'cause it cost too much 
 Plus these sucka niggas lame and they talk to much 
 That's why I'm ready for whatever, somebody better tell 'em 
 I be here when the smoke clear and everything settle for real 
 For real, ay, for real 
 I say, when everything settle for real 
 Ay, for real, ay, for real (I be here) 
 I say, when everything settle for real 
 For real, ay, for real (Ay, I say listen, homeboy) 
 I say, when everything settle for real (You can talk all you want, man) 
 For real, ay, for real (You know what I'm sayin,' everybody talkin' to the King, you know what I'm sayin') 
 I say, when everything settle for real (They like yesterdays, everybody got one) 
 Ay, but the fact of the matter remains 
 If ye ain't walked a mile in my shoes, and ye ain't lived a day in my life 
 Ye ain't survived the shit I done survived 
 Ye ain't had to deal with the shit I done had to deal with, homeboy 
 You can't motherfuckin' judge me, partner 
 I mean, look at folk like Sean Taylor 
 You know what they said? They said had he had a strap 
 He'd have lived today, you know what I'm sayin' 
 Now true enough, I was dead wrong, I broke the law 
 I deserve to be punished, I understand that, a'ight, cool 
 But listen, man, I got a house full of kids 
 A mama and an old lady whose life is my responsibility, you dig that? 
 Now, for all of y'all who think I was just ridin' around on some dumb shit 
 Ay, you know I'm smarter than you, man 
 You know I'm smarter than you, dog 
 Ay, if you think I was just bein' stupid 
 Shorty, I got some motherfuckin' oceanfront property in Idaho for sale, homie 
 If you beleive that, I got a bridge in Brooklyn I wanna sell you, partner 
 Ay, man, real talk 
 In order to understand my train of thought, you done have to put yourself in my position 
 you cant expect me to think like you, 'cause my life ain't like yours, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 If you don't understand that, you don't understand English, homeboy 
 I'm done talking
