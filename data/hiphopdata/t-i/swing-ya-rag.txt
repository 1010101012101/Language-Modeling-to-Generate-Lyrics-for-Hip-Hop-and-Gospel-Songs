 Woo, woo 
 Swizzy, I need y'all to take y'all rags out, man! (T.I.) 
 And let it swang, swang, swang, swang 
 Let it swang, swang, swang! (ATL) 
 (Swizz Beatz) 
 All right (All right), okay (Okay) 
 I don't dance (I don't dance), no way

 Hey, swang 
 (T.I.) 
 New Akoo outfit with a Gucci rag 
 Tied to my belt loop and my Louis bag 
 Full of stacks, rubber bands 'round big cash 
 Got a sick swag, tell the haters get mad, come on 
 We in the club, homes, gettin' our thug on 
 Bottles of Patr√≥n, if you grown, get your buzz on 
 We brought the broads out and brought the cars out 
 I'm like the moon, I shine and bring the stars out 
 When it dark out, get the squad out 
 We ball hard, sucka nigga, eat your heart out 
 I'm too advanced, super swag in my Louis pants 
 Ballin' on my Louis shoes, shirt match my Louis rag 
 (Swizz Beatz) 
 All right (All right), okay (Okay)

 I just take my Louis rag out and wave it around in the air

 Hey, swang 
 (T.I.) 
 I say, "Whoa, Kemosabe!", big ballin' is my hobby 
 I'm boppin' while I'm walkin',' rag fallin' out my pocket 
 If big money ain't the topic, homie I ain't even talkin' 
 Hated on by the workers, but I'm cool with all the bosses 
 Catch me flossin at the mall (Mall), talkin' to a broad (Broad) 
 She follow me in Gucci and I taught her how to ball 
 Three pair of shoes, four shirts, six rags 
 The chick said, "Dag, that's more than my bag!" 
 Shawty, I can show you how to spend this bread real fast 
 Then get a group of chicks to give you head real fast 
 Silk scarf hangin' out of my jeans 
 Naw, homie, I ain't thinkin',' I'm just doin' my thing! 
 (Swizz Beatz) 
 All right (All right), okay (Okay)

 Hey, swang 
 (T.I.) 
 I took some time off (Okay), and now I'm back, y'all (That's right) 
 You in the line at the club, I'm in the back, dawg (Ha) 
 And when this song on, ballers peel stacks off 
 And make it rain on them broads, watch your stacks fall 
 Hey, pull your rag out (That's right), and wave it left, right 
 Let it sag wit' ya pants, get ya swag just right 
 Ridin' Bankhead, flare flyin' out the Benz 
 Once a fool with it, we 'gon bring 'em out again
