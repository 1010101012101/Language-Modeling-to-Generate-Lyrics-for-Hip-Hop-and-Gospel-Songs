 ASAP ASAP ASAP 
 You niggas better exit 
 ASAP ASAP ASAP ASAP 
 A-S-A-P A-S-A-P

 I'm on my grind, Grand Hustle, got the mind and the muscle 
 50 carats in the crown just to shine on you suckers 
 Still tote the Glock .40 for the haters and the busters 
 Fuck probation, if a nigga try to play me, I'ma bust 'im 
 I don't need no security reachin' for my jewelry 
 Get ya niggas popped quick, filled full of hot shit 
 Fresh out the box, Tip hopped in a drop 6 
 Made a quarter mil in the pen gettin' stock tips 
 Haters wanna stop Tip, mad 'cause they not Tip 
 Ball every summer so ya baby mama jock Tip 
 You don't want no drama, pimp, I promise I do not slip 
 Chrome .45th hid well if the cops trip 
 Bought my girl a Hummer with the chrome right in front of that 
 Five carat stones with the platinum all up under that 
 Rap beef, I ain't gonna participate in none of that 
 I'm aimin' at yo fitted cap and you ain't gonna want none of that 
 A nigga try to play me, I'ma blow 'im off the map ASAP 
 Ask anybody who runnin' A.G., bet they finna say me ASAP 
 Niggas hatin' on P$C get straightened ASAP 
 A nigga try to play me, I'ma blow 'im off the map ASAP 
 I know a lot of rappers don't like me, but they won't fight me 
 Feds swear I sell dope, well why they won't indict me? 
 Advances on the throne I ain't never taken lightly 
 But all that tongue wrestlin' hatin' while I'm gone don't excite me 
 How many rappers you know that can hold they own on Rice Street? 
 Any steady talkin' on the cell phone nightly? 
 In normal population, half the jail just like me 
 Polices think I'm crazy, scared a nigga gone strike me 
 Contrarily, a nigga tryin' me is unlikely 
 They barkin don't bother me, I be bombin' 'fore they bite me 
 They just shocked to see my rap's exactly how my life be 
 Shiesty with a conversation quite pricey 
 My fists so rocky and my wrist so icy 
 Might be thrown off my rocker just slightly 
 Feisty, flamin' hot temper don't ignite me 
 I'm only gonna ask you "find the exit" once politely 
 A nigga try to play me, I'ma blow 'im off the map ASAP 
 Ask anybody who runnin' A.G., bet they finna say me ASAP 
 Niggas hatin' on P$C get straightened ASAP 
 A nigga try to play me, I'ma blow 'im off the map ASAP 
 What up, say hello to the man of the people 
 My plan is to keep you at least two levels under me where I need you 
 I'ma take advantage of my chance to defeat you 
 Ya true colors done shown, now it's on when I see you 
 I'm grown, nigga, so let it be known we ain't equal 
 You're sadly mistaken if you thinkin' I cant reach you 
 Beat you to a fucking pulp if I need to 
 The very spot you standin' in then is where I'll leave you 
 Seen on the scene, white tees and Evisus 
 O.G. status, I don't beef unless I need to 
 Sissy you way outta line and you runnin' outta time 
 Hang behind closed doors when you heard I got some time 
 Yeah, I know you were thinkin' "out of sight and out of mind" 
 But I'm the wrong one for you to try if you were tryin' to shine 
 Listen, nigga, this shit here is more than just a lot of rhymes 
 I don't know what you do for your respect, but I'ma die for mine 
 A nigga try to play me, I'ma blow 'im off the map ASAP 
 Ask anybody who runnin' A.G., bet they finna say me ASAP 
 Niggas hatin' on P$C get straightened ASAP 
 A nigga try to play me, I'ma blow 'im off the map ASAP 
 ASAP ASAP ASAP 
 ASAP ASAP ASAP 
 ASAP ASAP A-S-A-P A-S-A-P 
 ASAP ASAP ASAP
