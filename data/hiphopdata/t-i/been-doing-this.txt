Say man, old nigga told me 
 There two types of nigga in life, you dig that? 
 Niggas who talk that shit 
 And niggas who do that shit 
 Let them niggas gon' hate 'cause they got to 
 What I care about you 
 Hey, you know I been doin' this for years 
 Other niggas sell weight, I ain't got to 
 Lamborghinis, cop two 
 Hey you know I been doin' this for years 
 Lotta niggas gon' hate 'cause they got to 
 Never let 'em stop you 
 Hey, you know I been doin' this for years 
 Other niggas sell weight, I ain't got to 
 You know I been not to 
 Long as I been doin' this for years 
 Hit the club, do it big, show these niggas how I live 
 100 G's for the chain, couple o' mill for the crib 
 If you had it like I had, I bet you do it like this 
 Lamborghini doors goin' up, lookin' so sick 
 I make it rain, I make it rain in any club that I go into 
 Toss a couple stacks out, ballin' yeah, that's what I do 
 And these niggas know exactly what I'm riding on 
 24 inches on the old school 
 Beat up, knockin' 
 These hoes keep jockin' 
 And these tags I'ma pop 'em 
 I'm a real show shopper 
 Sold out shows everywhere I go 
 Just to hear the young boy from the old ways flow 
 When it comes to the money I'ma get that doe 
 I'ma get that doe, nigga, that's for sho' 
 Can't nobody do it quite like this man 
 They cool but they ain't like this man 
 Got ice on my neck and my wrist man 
 Y'all niggas can't do it like this man 
 And I'm sittin' on top whether you like it or not 
 Nigga, I won't flop 
 What you think 'cause I sold a couple of million 
 I'm gon' stop? 
 Let them niggas gon' hate 'cause they got to 
 What I care about you 
 Hey, you know I been doin' this for years 
 Other niggas sell weight, I ain't got to 
 Lamborghinis, cop two 
 Hey you know I been doin' this for years 
 Lotta niggas gon' hate 'cause they got to 
 Never let 'em stop you 
 Hey, you know I been doin' this for years 
 Other niggas sell weight, I ain't got to 
 You know I been not to 
 Long as I been doin' this for years 
 These nigga can't do it like I 
 Everyday this nigga stay fly 
 26 inches be on my ride 
 Here my doors be suicide 
 Still black card spending if it's hot then I'm in it 
 When it comes to the hoes you know I'ma get 'em 
 At the mall everyday so you know that I'm fitted 
 Everything that I done hop in undid it 
 Sold 3 mill first time I drop 
 6 years later still on top 
 Makin' these hits but it ain't gon' stop 
 I'ma get this money 'til my casket drop 
 And yes, yes my nigga, I'm a baller 
 They had to nickname me Mr. Tear The Mall Up 
 Clip the bar when I hit that mall 
 Shut the whole mall down 
 Buying everything I saw 
 And these lame niggas hating on me 
 'Cause they hoes all want me 
 Hey, it ain't my fault 
 You should havin' it check homie 
 Something like a pimp, yeah, I ball from a sip 
 So much money in my pocket got me walkin' with a limp 
 And you say you got money but it ain't like this 
 And I'ma keep shinin' on you haters so sick, let's go 
 Let them niggas gon' hate 'cause they got to 
 What I care about you 
 Hey, you know I been doin' this for years 
 Other niggas sell weight, I ain't got to 
 Lamborghinis, cop two 
 Hey you know I been doin' this for years 
 Lotta niggas gon' hate 'cause they got to 
 Never let 'em stop you 
 Hey, you know I been doin' this for years
