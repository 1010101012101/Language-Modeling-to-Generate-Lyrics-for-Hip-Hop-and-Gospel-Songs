Money, hoes, cars and clothes, that's how all my niggas know 
 Blowin' dro, 24s, that's how all my niggas roll 
 Money, hoes, cars and clothes, that's how all my niggas know 
 Blowin' dro, 24s, that's how all my niggas roll 
 In a drop top chevy with the roof wide open 
 My partners looking at me to see if my eyes open 
 'Cause I've been drank, and I've been smoke 
 Flying down 285 but I'm focused 
 It's a four fifty four, where it says I raise comotion 
 White leather seats, as fresh as air forces 
 Doing 'bout a hundred but the track still bumping 
 Number 8 on nwa straight out of compton 
 Pull up at your apartment sitting on 24s 
 And the dope boys, saying the kids running in 
 The clicks start dealing and the broads start choosing 
 And the cars been parked but the rims keep moving 
 Sign pictures by the hundred, to the youngins in the hood 
 'Cause I ain't Hollywood, I come from the hood 
 I'm use to it, if your rear view shaking and your seats vibrating 
 24 inch jays got the chevrolet shaking 
 Money, hoes, cars and clothes, that's how all my niggas know 
 Blowin' dro, 24s, that's how all my niggas roll 
 Money, hoes, cars and clothes, that's how all my niggas know 
 Blowin' dro, 24s, that's how all my niggas roll 
 I'll make a mill and I'm satisfied, I'll get the rest 
 At the age of seventeen, entertaing the rides, I want the best 
 I refuse to get a 9 to 5, I'm a flip my keys 
 Been paying my dues since 89, trying to get my cheese 
 Diamonds gleam when I'm on the scene, they know it's me 
 Ain't no dream or no fantasy its T I P 
 Brought busting, like a baby do a blanket 
 5 karats on my motherfucking pinkie, half of hennessy and belevedere 
 What we dranking, pimps send for broads 
 What the hell you niggas thinkin',
