 All I've got is 5,10 20's in my pocket 
 And I'm giving 5,10,20's when she drop it 
 That nigga crazy when she tell me how she want it 
 And she says uh huh uh huh and I'm on it 
 Baby make it clap like a crowd right after my show 
 Then she spread it open and show me some more 
 Then she make it drop till her booty hit the floor 
 You can get it if you're with it let me hear you say 
 Uh huh (shake yo ass) 
 Uh huh (make it bounce) 
 Uh huh (drop it low) 
 Uh huh (stick it out) 
 Uh huh (bring it back)

 Want you to drop it want you to shake it 
 Want you to hurt somebody but don't break it 
 Baby gettin' down down dirty in the club while 
 She shake her ass that's her way of showin love? 
 She done with you she'll be leaving with a thug (that's the truth) 
 She the truth an addiction like a drug 
 Baby make it clap like a crowd right after my show 
 Then she spread it open and show me some more 
 Then she make it drop till her booty hit the floor 
 You can get it if you're with it let me hear you say 
 Uh huh (shake yo ass)

 T.i. 
 I came in the club chain hanging to my waste line 
 Lookin' for the dames who lookin' to have a great time 
 Young pimpin' play no games and I don't waste time 
 Say super clean 2 steppin to the base line 
 I'm in the v.i.p. with 50 freeks Holla A-town 
 All fat from the waiste down with their face (?) 
 Pass around shots of patrone they feelin' great now 
 They loose of a bottle of goose all I can say now 
 Is love to see you do your thang bend it over drop it low 
 Your bottoms got your booty pressin open like a (?) 
 Forget me boo for askin this but answer 'cause I gotta know 
 Whatcha doin' after this the phantom right outside the door 
 The mansion is emmaculate its worth a couple mill or more 
 The scenery is fabolous can tell me if you don't wanna go 
 Ask around shawty, every broad in the city know 
 Its real, TIP live like a TIP drill video 
 Uh huh (shake yo ass) 
 Uh huh (make it bounce) 
 Uh huh (drop it low) 
 Uh huh (stick it out)
