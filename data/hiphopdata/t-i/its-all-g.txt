It's all G, it's all G, it's all G 
 Ay ay ay ay it's all G 
 It's all G 
 Even though I'm wanted dead or alive 
 By the jackers and the robbers and paramour guys 
 I keep my head to the sky 
 Embrace the pain 
 I'm facing 25 but I can't complain 
 It's all G, I walked through the fire before 
 Hey I survived with the guys on the fire before 
 It's all G; let the haters conversate on me 
 Says he to easy to take the heat and put the weight on me 
 It's all G 
 Let me tell ya how ya measure a man 
 When you fold under pressure when the fans come and get ya 
 Can you hold it together till it's over that's special 
 When you have the same swagger when the world laughing at ya 
 I'd like the animality girl I'd like to ask ya 
 Well y'all keep cracking or will ya keep laughing 
 Be the same person even if it ain't worth it 
 I'll blow it all paper call I said the flow worth it 
 One thang you serve two thang you show it 
 I might be hurting but you won't even complain to know 
 I keep my head to the sky saying cry for the cowards 
 Keep your face dry brotha do it in the showers 
 Wipe it all with a towel no emotions 
 It's all G 
 Even though I'm wanted dead or alive 
 By the jackers and the robbers and paramour guys 
 I keep my head to the sky 
 Embrace the pain 
 I'm facing 25 but I can't complain 
 It's all G, I walked through the fire before 
 Hey I survived with the guys on the fire before 
 It's all G; let the haters conversate on me 
 Says he to easy to take the heat and put the weight on me 
 It's all G 
 Remember first God put you to sing words 
 Jenovah gotta be a purpose don't think he ain't worth it 
 Sometimes he's only searching 
 Listen hear an ounce and learn that from an old person 
 He can show you things that you done take for granted 
 Then get back again better than you had it then 
 And reveal to you your real friends then 
 You reach a hand that took the babies hand in 
 Like the way the kids grew up scared before 
 It's all G, It's like I've never been scared before 
 A long time I should've been there you know 
 It's all G 
 Even though I'm wanted dead or alive 
 By the jackers and the robbers and paramour guys 
 I keep my head to the sky 
 Embrace the pain 
 I'm facing 25 but I can't complain 
 It's all G, I walked through the fire before 
 Hey I survived with the guys on the fire before 
 It's all G; let the haters conversate on me 
 Says he's to easy to take the heat and put the weight on me 
 It's all G 
 I got wonder what got him so upset 
 Guess 'cause I'm the best that's what I get 
 Maybe 'cause when I talk more to see me suffer 
 Won't get him the ammunition ha... 
 No point to pretend I don't mean to be long with me 
 But I gotta ask this question y'all before this songs ended 
 Would you ever see you sweat and never see him fed? 
 You ready for whatever thinking never direspect 
 How about the haters who they pensive as they say 
 I was a done dollar but I just come harder 
 I went through all that just to become smarter 
 And tomorrow I can see in the headlines 
 TI not guilty wave the fine to the bad guys 
 They kinda mad today to sell the scene 
 All hail the king 
 It's all G 
 Even though I'm wanted dead or alive 
 By the jackers and the robbers and paramour guys 
 I keep my head to the sky 
 Embrace the pain 
 I'm facing 25 but I can't complain hey 
 It's all G
