 My dynamite stick known to drive chick crazy baby 
 While you laying on your back with your feet up 
 Right there in my wife beater 
 She like the way I eat her, beat her, beat her 
 Treat her like an animal somebody call PETA 
 Put a little bit of this inside a margarita 
 Then put your thing in her have her running like a meter 
 On a cab in the city where the girls are pretty 
 Find me in the club where the girls get busy 
 With a flask on a fat booty, nice shaped titties 
 My wrist so froze you could ice skate with it 
 Give it to you till you curlin' your toes 
 Get your ass out your clothes, sit back and behold the explosion
