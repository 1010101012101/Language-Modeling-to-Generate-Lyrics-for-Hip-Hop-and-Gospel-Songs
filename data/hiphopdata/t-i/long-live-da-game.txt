YEA... 
 Dis for all my niggaz who think dey hard... 
 (Laughing) 
 You wanna know what's hard (what's hard pimp?) 
 Goin' about yo day nigga losin yo life at the end of it 
 Now dats what's hard...(MINDING MY MUTHAFUCKING BUSINESS) 
 Let me tell y'all 'bout the last day I lived nigga 
 I'm in the 96 Impala with the gat in my lap 
 Annihilating any nigga tryin' to work in my trap 
 Now see the feds got me tap'd 
 So to keep 'em off of my bac 
 I got a crib in the trap and a crib to relax 
 Now my indictment was a secret and that's the way that they keep it 
 If I ain't have a hoe givin' head to the feds 
 Comin' bac tellin' me exactly what they said 
 I'm a dead man walkin'... 
 Waitin on time in jail 
 But I'll die before I let 'em stop my mail 
 Long as I got another ounce to sell 
 What the hell I'ma bail? a grap my scale 
 Get another key and I'ma slang my yayo 
 Niggaz on the westside can't re-up becuz it's a drought 
 So I check the crack house... 
 DAMN it sold out 
 So back to the crib so I can check this stash 
 Ain't sure about how much dope I had 
 Got a couple keyz in the safe right now 
 Weigh it up cook it up then chop it down 
 Now I'm ready to go and pick up my fetti 
 But before I leave the house I can't dip without grabbin my G'z 
 And my keyz to my brand new V put 'em in pocket with the gat to see 
 Niggaz pleeze nigga you holla bout freeze 
 Put this red dot to ya ass and squeeze 
 Now I'm dippin bac to the swats 
 With the 4-4 and a plastic glock 
 Turned around and I had to stop 
 Couldn't trap swarn it wuz cops 
 Standin there and I still ain't scared 
 Mac Boney nem must have fled 
 Only cops is I fear is the feds 
 On my car flashin blue and red 
 Damn there dey go now its time to dip 
 Got the 4-4 right my hip 
 9 millimeter wit a extra clip 
 Dats what y'all niggaz get fuckin' round wit TIP 
 Bustin' at 'em 
 N cussin at 'em but ain't no shakin 'em 
 Them bullets dat they wuz bustin' at me my vest wuz takin' 'em 
 Makin' dem pigs fall in pain 
 Turned around 'cause one call my name 
 Took a hot one to the brain 
 Yeah I died but LONG LIVE THA GAME...
