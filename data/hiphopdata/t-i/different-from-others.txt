Now don't try to point fingers or laugh at a man who popped a million pills 
 Because I can come right back and make you frown since I got a stack of bills 
 I've been clean for 2 years and no thoughts of turning back 
 To the time period where I looked like a smoked crack 
 My girls are the only ones that matter 
 So haters just quit the fuckin' chatter 
 Adrenaline rushing at another level 
 So cut the shit and stop competing with these pussy devils 
 Writers block took the most outta me 
 So I'm gunna release hell on this game undoubtedly 
 My ex turned lesbian so she no longer wants to fuck me 
 Approach her abruptly so eat a motherfuckin pussy till you reach the point of gluttony 
 It ain't about the chains or the fame I never would of came in this game if it wasn't for the lifestyle 
 That I had wanted to hold a knife while havin' anything I could 
 No one is the same so I would never change if I could
