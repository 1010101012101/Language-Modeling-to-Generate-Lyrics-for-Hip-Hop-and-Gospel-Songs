Ay I'm working here, know what I'm saying 
 Try to put yourself in my shoes for a second 
 It's not personal I'm just sayin' though 
 Ay look 
 From when the moon came out till the sun came up 
 I was supplyin the days when where they flame up 
 Our mamas passing, by trying to explain us 
 Pissing in the bushes like they never house trained us 
 But, try to understand that's how we came up 
 You get to know us, you'll love us but you can't change us (naw) 
 Really we rather be rich and famous 
 But in the mean time were forced to slang dust 
 'Dro or crack cocaine, Penicillin to Rogaine 
 Ecstacy, Viagra, whatever'll get the dough mayne 
 I'm tired of people mis-representing my dough mayne 
 Oh you think we out here killing for nothing, hustling 
 For no gain (picture that) 
 Hey man I'm just doing my job 
 Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job 
 I don't want to make your life more harder, I'm just doin' my job 
 You live here, I work here I'm doing my job 
 I don't know if you don't know, don't care or can't see 
 Every time something up in the hood, it ain't me 
 And I ain't always up to no good and know the crease 
 And we ain't always gotta pass through the hood without speaking (how you doing) 
 We ain't out here threatening your lives, raping your children 
 We just out here staying alive, making a million (you know) 
 Working hard, trying to survive chasing a mill-ion 
 You hear us talking loud, just think of this is chameleon 
 React to the situations, but accusations is still 
 ? And rise in your house, I mean you just hurting my feelings (man) 
 We got lives, we want to live nice too 
 We got moms, dads, wise kids just like you 
 But I ? a few, its hell in high school 
 When your helping with the rent lights and the gas bill too 
 So before you go judging us loving us won't hurt 
 Yeah under 25, staying alive is hard work 
 Hey man I'm just doing my job 
 Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job 
 I don't want to make your life more harder, I'm just doin' my job 
 You live here, I work here I'm doing my job 
 And for you to see what I'm saying, open eyes will help 
 If you could think about somebody besides yourself 
 Why you pointing fingers at me, analyze yourself 
 Quit all that chastising and try to provide some help 
 Instead of calling the law, you busting my balls 
 With all due respect, we don't even need to be fucking with y'all (man) 
 And we can't help it cause it is like this 
 We don't like it no more than you that we live like this 
 Hallway, stuck in the grass summertime to wintertime 
 Cutting school to sell fifty dimes by dinner time 
 See everything we know we learned from the streets 
 Since thirteen I've been hustling and earning my keep 
 Hey man I'm just doing my job 
 Hey lady, don't mind me I'm just doing my job 
 I don't want to make your life more harder, I'm just doin' my job 
 You live here, I work here I'm doing my job
