 (Mannie Fresh:) 
 Ladies and gentlemen... Fre-fre-fre-fresh! 
 (T.I. talkin':) 
 T.I.P. aye! 
 I know alot of y'all niggas out there, man who ain't up on this down south shit 
 Probably wonderin' what the fuck you listenin' to right now, ahah! 
 King amongst kings! It's an absolute honor & a pleasure y'know I'm sayin' 
 To bring you... some gangsta shit of catastrophic proportions 
 All the UGK alumni like myself know what this is man. 
 Hey Bun! Pimp C nigga! 
 (T.I.:) 
 I gotta '66 Impala so fresh 
 White top, burnt drop wit' the choppers on deck 
 It was off, Panda motor on a '94 'Vette 
 Fish bowl, televisions pimpin' I ain't done yet 
 I got the checker red leather & I'm sittin' on chrome 
 On 26 inches just to get my roll on 
 One of Jeezy's songs on, make them bitches get low 
 I get that ass raised up, like Dr. Dre 6'4 
 Hey, come up in my hood, bet them bitches know Tip 
 If you tell 'em you wit' him, all them bitches gon' strip 
 If I show up in yo' hood, I bet you niggas won't trip 
 Once I empty out this clip, I bet you niggas gon' dip 
 Or get hit up in yo'...

 And we never let hoe ass niggas ride! 
 (Bun B:) 
 It's the Gulf Way Boulevard gangsta 
 Swangin' on T.I. essence of fo's 
 Pirellis and blazin' 'em crews of hoe 
 I'm A Player, you can tell by how I choose my hoes 
 When it gets to swangin' on the curb, you might lose your toes 
 Dedicated to the slab, the dunks, the drops 
 The candy painted cars wit' the chopped off tops 
 Now put your diamonds up against the wood wheel 
 Lean back or throw your leather, chunk a deuce and show your grill 
 Keep it trill, this the south baby, Texas and GA 
 T.I. reppin' for Bankhead, I'm reppin' for P.A. (for P.A.) 
 Now pop your trunk, get it crunk, it's time to ride 
 Show them boys you got that Front Back and side to side baby. 
 "Back, Front Back, Fr-Front Back, Fr-Front Back, side to side" 
 "Back, Front Back, Fr-Front Back, Fr-Front Back, side to side" 
 Never let hoe ass niggas ride! 
 "Back, Front Back, Fr-Front Back, Fr-Front Back, side to side" 
 "Back, Front Back, Fr-Front Back, Fr-Front Back, side to side" 
 And we never let hoe ass niggas ride! 
 (Pimp C:) 
 I'm switchin' lane to lane, leanin' on the switch 
 Sippin' on the barre, smokin' green and hittin' licks 
 Bumpin' Too $hort baby, in the candy red whips 
 Drop the top and pimp the lot and watch the trunk do tricks 
 Pimp C, I keep my money on my mind 
 Keep a hooker on the track and keep a swisher full of pine 
 If you'know like I know, you wouldn't try it 
 Wanna jack me for my candy car, you must wanna die 
 But I don't really wanna hit you wit' this hot thing 
 I just wanna get some brain in the turnin' lane 
 Comin' down creepin' slow, sippin' on a poor fo' 
 Bangin' on the screw and keep the pistol right here in the do' (echoes)
