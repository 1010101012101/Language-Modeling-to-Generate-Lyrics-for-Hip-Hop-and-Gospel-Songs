Old habit die hard huh 
 Disrespect will not be disregarded partna 
 You cross dat line I'm goin' off bout mine 
 Man woman and child, no exception homeboy 
 No disrespect will be tolerated man come hell or high water 
 You understand that? You bitch! 
 Bankroll mafia, hustle gang ova everythang nigga 
 I got fake bitches on my timeline, ay 
 Sucka niggas in my rearview 
 Wonder why I'm even wasting my time 
 Even replying to let you know I don't feel you, fuck 'em! 
 Dodging nothin' but a Fed case 
 Betta know it, tired of holdin' on to dead weight 
 Goin' let it go, ain't no turnin' round lookin' back 
 I swear to God I'ma drop a gem like cookin' crack 
 And sell it hard, I'ma 
 Bankhead nigga to the heart, with 
 Tote tools on the boulevard 
 It's young niggas in a stolen car 
 With expensive ambition and exquisite pistols we showin' off 
 Caught that line and we goin' off 
 And let his mom give a damn, who you goin' call? 
 You violatin, we ain't lettin' nothin' go at all 
 We demonstrate and leave your brains on the fuckin' wall 
 Pussy, you disrespectful nigga, got that 
 I ain't never been shot at, and I ain't shot back 
 Bossed up in a cool whip with a hot gat 
 And still got stacks from back from "What you know about that?" 
 I'm just a project nigga on the front steps 
 And gettin' money is the concept 
 By any means, and the belt where the gun kept 
 I let that whole clip ride, till ain't one left in it 
 Try me, I'ma handle my business 
 Handle my business 
 Try me 
 I'ma handle my business 
 Try me I'ma handle my business, try me 
 I got fake bitches on my timeline and 
 Hatin' niggas in my rearview 
 I got naked bitches in the high rise 
 On the balcony so they could get a clear view 
 Of the city with my dick up in it 
 But in the morning won't remember which bitch is it, shit 
 Ay I'm too rich for this shit but I'm too real to be tried nigga 
 Going against me just like goin' against God 
 And I ain't gotta make excuses, why 
 I don't fuck whoever, whatchu wanna do about it 
 Thought not, fuck around get crossed out 
 You caught slippin' roll down on your ass, .45 start spittin' 
 Goin' be a long day nigga I start trippin' 
 Don't be stickin' to the script, drive-by audition, what's up? 
 Whatchu do for dough, guess you do it too slow 
 And by the looks of your stuff, you ain't doin' enough 
 I'm poppin' witnesses in the front, leave you in the dust 
 Kick in your door masked up like, "Who in the fuck?" 
 Boy you is a ho ho, not just a little piece of pussy 
 Betta watch your ass talkin', you don't me nigga holdup 
 I'm just a project nigga on the front steps 
 And gettin' money is the concept 
 By any means, and the belt where the gun kept 
 I let that whole clip ride, till ain't one left in it 
 Try me, I'ma handle my business 
 Handle my business 
 Try me 
 I'ma handle my business 
 Try me I'ma handle my business 
 Try me 
 All I wanna do is go and chill 
 Take my mind off the ones I wanna go and kill 
 Yeah, I'm a daddy, love my little girls 
 But I'll still check a bitch like 'Pac did Lauryn Hill 
 Hey, hey I ain't grow into it, I was born with it 
 Used to sell crack to the children of the corn 
 I'm the reason why your mama warned you 
 Pray you don't die before you make it to the street corner 
 Nigga back! Who am I 
 I'm just a project nigga on the front steps 
 And gettin' money is the concept 
 By any means, and the belt where the gun kept 
 I let that whole clip ride, till ain't one left in it 
 Try me, I'ma handle my business 
 Handle my business 
 Try me 
 I'ma handle my business 
 Try me I'ma handle my business 
 Try me
