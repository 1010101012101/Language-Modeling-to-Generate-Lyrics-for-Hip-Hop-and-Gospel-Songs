 Respect this hustle, respect this hustle 
 Wont accept nothin' less, so respect this hustle 
 I ain't in it for the fame I ain't in it for the glory 
 I'm down to die for it absolutely mandatory 
 Respect this hustle, respect this hustle 
 Wont accept nothin' less, so respect this hustle 
 (T.I.) 
 These niggas bitch made I'm gettin' paid six ways 
 My shits laid and shits sprayed with lemonade with blades, 
 Keep your mouth closed you don't want to get sprayed 
 Shoot you down your body make you sun bathe six days, 
 Kamikazee renegade, now we never been afraid 
 Kept the trap hot enough to fry egg in the shade, 
 I ball till the day lying dead in the grave 
 Leave the feds behind the wall 'cause I ain't get away, 
 Chopper round the corner in a bush with a brick of yay, 
 A bust can happen any day, we out here trapping anyway, 
 Gettin' money to them Haitians damn what a nigga say, 
 I got a real bad condition if I ain't gettin' paid, 
 Hand over fist what I'm missing got to get busy, 
 I know you see this car I'm driving and see the house that I live in 
 And figure this is enough, 
 But nigga I want way more really this is play doe, you set your sites way low. 
 I had enough of the game I don't know whether to stay or go. 
 Different groups of lames and suckers I don't know which way I go, 
 Well nigga you know you king why you always got to say it for? 
 'Cause they said I couldn't say it before, 
 And I remember all it did was fuck my temper up more Doug and "J" know, 
 I say I wear the crown, not a halo sorry, 
 Niggas think they seeing me but they so sorry, 
 They fast but they ain't no ferrai, NRROWM.

 You think you been pulling gats cussing fussing enough 
 Here bragging bout these niggas you been busting enough, 
 Man look around ain't nobody suffering but her, 
 You could beat a hundred cases catch one and you fucked. 
 (I get probation) 
 Is you crazy pull your gun in the club, 
 See how many folks and polices put you down in the club. 
 If we got to come with a slug why we come to the club 
 How much more of this shit you think we can put under the rug 
 Look we already told them I Told You So, 
 But all these niggas speaking out whoever spoke before, 
 Don't take it personal people want to be close to folk, 
 What you think the television and the posters for? 
 (I'm claustrophobic though) 
 Well then you need to see a doctor for it, 
 Man I ain't joking you close t.i.p. and bout to blow it, 
 Did you forget about them nights in the cells was you honesty 
 When we was having talks with God and you promise, 
 If he could make away for you to be large and you done it. 
 Out the gate Urban Legend went on to do numbers, 
 Sold a mill made ATL king first week, 
 Five hundred with the Grammy (but not the one that I wanted), 
 What about them eight figure deals and that other new money, 
 But ask yourself something where the 
 Gun you got from me? Keep it real... 
 You need to think of someone other than yourself some time, did you keep your promise... 
 Keep it real.
