I'm smoking dope, I'm on my cell phone 
 I'm selling dope, straight off the iPhone 
 He wanna quote, he talking 9 zones 
 He bought four, I front him 5 more 
 9 piece, straight 8 balls 
 MJG bitch I got 8 balls 
 9 piece, straight 8 balls 
 MJG bitch I got 8 balls 
 (Rick Ross - Verse 1) 
 Suave house, stil lindependant 
 Distribution Mexican 
 He still sending 
 No contract, take my word 
 Send a hundred packs bitch 
 Them my birds 
 Shoe box, no shoes in 'em 
 In the two seater, me and two women 
 No Def Jam, went solo 
 Took the custy's price so low 
 (Rick Ross - Chorus) 
 I'm smoking dope, I'm on my cell phone 
 I'm selling dope, straight off the iPhone 
 He wanna quote, he talking 9 zones 
 He bought four, I front him 5 more 
 9 piece, straight 8 balls 
 MJG bitch I got 8 balls 
 9 piece, straight 8 balls 
 MJG bitch I got 8 balls 
 (T.I - Verse 2) 
 It's the king young gunna 
 Hotter thana suana in the summer 
 N-gga think I'm playing round if you wanna 
 Bring the thunder and the lightening 
 Like a sighting if you try me 
 On that Wrren Buffet sh-t 
 That monkey sh-t behind me 
 You want me square n-gga you know where to find me 
 Don't call me on my cell 
 Yopu tryna send a pimp to jail 
 If you buying 25 you can get it for the twelve 
 Uncut, rocked up, got hand and pale yeah 
 Hey let me send a little message to my enemies 
 You n-gga get to telling have 'em buried ?fore they sentence me 
 Come to ATL, hit any trap they remember me 
 Billionniare swag witha dope boys energy 
 (Rick Chorus)

 Soft white, I got that G-mix

 I'm on the road, lets buy some new whips 
 Trick a hundred hoes

 Bullet proof, n-gga teflon
