(Trey Songz - Chorus) 
 Call me Mr Kodak 
 Smile, I'm picture perfect 
 Got my jewelery shining 
 That's a Kodak moment 
 Call me Mr. Kodak you know I'm stayin' focused 
 Life is like a photograph 
 Get money is my slogan 
 (T.I - Verse 1) 
 You must be camera shy, I'm paparazzi prone 
 They flashin' I'm the main attraction, need no microphone 
 Wide screen me, get your High Definition on 
 Everytime you see me my neck and wrist glisten homes 
 Sittin' on, big bank 
 I'm sober dawg, but your b-tch ain't 
 Yellow watch yellow chain drippin', piss stains 
 Tipple lane know that Kodak couldn't picture this 
 (Trey Songz - Chorus) 
 Call me Mr Kodak 
 Smile, I'm picture perfect 
 Got my jewelery shining 
 That's a Kodak moment 
 Call me Mr. Kodak you know I'm stayin' focused 
 Life is like a photograph 
 Get money is my slogan 
 High definition and when I come around 
 See the cameras flick up when I'm in your town 
 Cal me Mr Kodak 
 Smile, I'm picture perfect 
 Got my jewelry shinnin' it's a Kodak moment 
 (T.I. Verse 2) 
 Ay the King here, see me clear, megapixels 
 For real n-gga, try me, get erased like a pencil 
 And until a n-gga kill me I'ma shine on (shine on) 
 You can have whatever light, just give me mine homes 
 I get my grind on like I'm dead broke 
 I swear man I'm so money hungry till my head hurt 
 Respect my evolution, check your resolution 
 Leave the apartment, red carpet ready, get camera shootin' 
 (Trey Songz - Chorus) 
 (T.I. - Verse 3) 
 On your Q's and your P, boy, you better be 
 Gon need a dark room to develop me 
 My pedigree (pedigree) is hella G (is hella g) 
 20 Mill, b-tch ain't nothin' you could tell a G 
 God damn cauliflower, celery 
 All about my Brussels sprouts, you better tell them C 
 Overseas I go Brazil, Monaco, Belize 
 Camera notice like you won't believe 
 (T.I) 
 Yeah, Mr TMZ himself, haha, yeah 
 Access Hollywood, n-gga I access your Hollywood 
 You understand that? ah huh 
 Look at me man, front page man, you know what I'm sayin' 
 You can check me standin' tall holmes 
 Get your wide screen on 
 You know what I'm sayin', upgrade your resolution man 
 High definition required, you dig that? yeah 
 You need 3d glasses to see me n-gga!
