 Plus you no I keep the thick things 
 Sittin' stuff wid more stuffin 
 In da turkey on thanksgivin'

 Eh yo wots poppin' poppin' 
 Crackin' crackin' he yappin yappin 
 Nuttin happened happened 
 Got ya raches so cock it back 
 Der known as hammer tone 
 He ain't lettin his hammer off 
 Dey was on dat side of the street deep 
 I ran across like who handle floss 
 Man dem niggaz was scared to talk 
 Five boroughs of death in the flesh 
 I am new york 
 Gotta brand new hammer 
 Ask me how much that hammer cost 
 Imma tell u I done it man of course 
 Its summin like I put my raches to the statue of liberty head 
 'Cause I killed the city 
 Then I resurrected the dead 
 Dis da ressurextion 
 Met wid a better preference instead 
 Havin' sex wid weapons 
 Slept wid mr smith and west ina bed 
 'Cause all dem lil niggaz no 
 My blueprint works 
 Dat y dey follow it 
 Listen lil two cent jerks 
 U wanna borrow it 
 Here, u can use this turn 
 If you dnt bring it back when you blow 
 Ull get merked 
 So many pussys in da industry 
 Man I'm gettin' hornier 
 I'm gettin' nicer 
 These niggaz gettin' cornier 
 When da time right 
 Imma back down all of ya 
 He ain't a gangsta 
 He a weekend warrior 
 I got dem sick to they stomach 
 Slumped wid nazier 
 Show money wid all of ya 
 I ain't a hater but I'm startin to hate u 
 Y u tellin' me wot dey do 
 U makin' me think you wanna be rollin' wid they crew 
 When niggaz ask them who get busy they dnt say u 
 When they break bread together they ain't gon pay u 
 Get out of this game fool 
 U shoulda been a teacher 
 'Cause you be promotin more niggaz in grade school 
 F dat all dem niggaz need to be left back 
 If it ain't dumma dumma dumma 
 I dnt respect that 
 What you No About Pap?

 Hey Man In Dem
