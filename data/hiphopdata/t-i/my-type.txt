Lets go... Y'all gon wish for a nigga like me 
 When I ain't here you know what I'm sayin' (You think I'm lyin') 
 (Say goodbye to the bad guy) 
 (You don't appreciate a nigga my type, 
 Once I die there ain't no more niggas my type, 
 So just remember me right) 
 Bet you don't appreciate a nigga my type, 
 But when I die there ain't no more niggas my type, 
 So just remember me right, 
 Bet if I let them suckers kill me tonight, 
 All them haters gon' be filled with delight, 
 God forgive me aight, 
 I sacrifice so they can live my life, 
 If necessary I'll give my life, 
 What you hear is my life, 
 Reputation decorated with stripes, 
 No need crying at the end of my life, 
 Just remember me right 
 When your back was against the wall remember where could you go, 
 Remember who helped you again like he helped you before, 
 Went out the way to let you know that you ain't never alone, 
 They disrespect, you come get who? they left you alone, 
 They taught you how to be weak, he taught you how to be strong, 
 Taught you not to accept defeat, you go all out or be gone, 
 But it ain't the same in the streets now that he's gone, 
 He now in heaven on the throne exactly where he belong, 
 He left millions devastated and his family mourned, 
 Sons turn to grown men since their daddy been gone, 
 Daughters grew, like him or not he left his family on, 
 Even prepaid the funeral service that he had in the dome, 
 And then they came to represent for a stand up gent, 
 Who walked it like he talked it, always said what he meant, 
 Impossible to stop him, had a head like cement, 
 Maybe now you'll appreciate the nigga like this... 
 Bet you don't appreciate a nigga my type, 
 But when I die there ain't no more niggas my type, 
 So just remember me right, 
 Bet if I let them suckers kill me tonight, 
 All them haters gon' be filled with delight, 
 God forgive me aight, 
 I sacrifice so they can live my life, 
 If necessary I'll give my life, 
 What you hear is my life, 
 Reputation decorated with stripes, 
 No need crying at the end of my life, 
 Just remember me right 
 If they only knew the man outside of the hype, 
 No matter what the situation was, he alway try to do right, 
 Still they gossip and told lies, used to take him for granted, 
 Often found it hard to relate, somehow they couldn't understand it, 
 'Cause that respect he gon' demand it, there's a problem he handle it, 
 Looked adversity in the eye, he never ran from a challenge, 
 They try to knock him off balance when the FEDS came and got him, 
 Did the time on their head, came home, they ain't stop him, 
 While them niggas used to hate him, but they girl use to jock him, 
 Swear he had the type swagger that made the world stop and watch him, 
 Plus he possessed so much hustle, made it impossible to top him, 
 Got better every album, haters hated to see him drop em', 
 They just talk shit from a distance, when he around they playin' possum, 
 He use to scare the suckers shitless, probably why them niggas shot him, 
 Guess that's what it took, nothing else than what they could've ever did about him, 
 So go on talk shit about him, at least you ain't forgot about him... I see 
 Bet you don't appreciate a nigga my type, 
 But when I die there ain't no more niggas my type, 
 So just remember me right, 
 Bet if I let them suckers kill me tonight, 
 All them haters gon' be filled with delight, 
 God forgive me aight, 
 I sacrifice so they can live my life, 
 If necessary I'll give my life, 
 What you hear is my life, 
 Reputation decorated with stripes, 
 No need crying at the end of my life, 
 Just remember me right 
 Wanna say sorry to my Momma, 
 King and Lil Mama, 
 See me go through so much drama, 
 You could stand a little thunder, 
 Never let em' see you sweat, stay cool as a cucumber, 
 Stay ready for whatever, make note I'ma do wonder, 
 How he died? On his feet, like a man with honor, 
 Showed you the sky was the limit, you can do whatever you wanna, 
 Dats for bubba and demani, deja, and neek neek, 
 Don't worry 'bout me, Uncle Phil and little Le is with me, 
 See me with your granddaddy, 
 I know you gon' miss daddy, 
 But life ain't always a dream, and horrible shit happens, 
 Hate I let them niggas kill me before I could quit rapping, 
 Wish I could've spent more time with ya, I know you woulda been happy, 
 But I had to take the chances, you would have been trappin', 
 Long as I could keep that from happening, ya Papi could die happy, 
 So keep the wind at your back and the sun at your face, 
 Remember winnin' in your blood you were born with what it take (okay).. 
 Bet you don't appreciate a nigga my type, 
 But when I die there ain't no more niggas my type, 
 So just remember me right, 
 Bet if I let them suckers kill me tonight, 
 All them haters gon' be filled with delight, 
 God forgive me aight, 
 I sacrifice so they can live my life, 
 If necessary I'll give my life, 
 What you hear is my life, 
 Reputation decorated with stripes, 
 No need crying at the end of my life, 
 Just remember me right
