 You know you don't want these problems 
 Nigga, you know you don't want these problems 
 I got a snub nose, for you fuck hoes 
 Steady talkin' tough I bet you ain't gon bust though 
 I'm a gangsta bitch, we ain't alike there ain't a night 
 I ain't ridin' with that 5, Shawty show you're right 
 Me slip like pow 
 On the low between us, I'm strapped right now 
 Yeah, fed case, ain't nothing to me 
 I'm a head K, know that when you run into me 
 Get money, every G you make it like 100 to me 
 I'm fresh out for some these niggas, they big dummies to me 
 Okay? Now get some paper if you wanna play 
 Have yo head in my hallway for 100K 
 If you knew it as you don't 
 Nigga, this ain't what you want 
 Keep on playin' with me hatin' and you ain't gon' make it home 
 If you knew it as you don't 
 Nigga, this ain't what you want 
 Think 'cause I went to prison I won't put the pistol to yo dome

 Nigga, you know you don't want these problems 
 It's funny how niggas get hype when they get on stage with a mic 
 You know I see 'em bitin' the style cool, they still can't deliver it right 
 I've been killin' this shit for so long, I don't remember the hype 
 What's that like? They ain't really bout that life, They ain't really bout that life 
 No lie on this mic, chillin' with habitual whores 
 Hit 'er with the hammer like Thor 
 This ain't no boy, this a G4 ho, act like you been here before 
 Open up the suicide doors, like I jumped out the window of the 25th floor 
 Ready for war, I came out the womb with a sword, cut my umbilical chord 
 See I'm headin' where you ain't never been 
 We are not the same and that's evident 
 I make flexin' just look so effortless 
 Hit that celary till I'm hella baked 
 See these hoes, these hoes ain't celibate 
 And they ain't hesitant, not at all 
 For a nigga with a proper draw, she give me that box like a post office dropped it off, that's real 
 If you knew it as you don't 
 Nigga, this ain't what you want 
 Keep on playin' with me hatin' and you ain't gon' make it home 
 If you knew it as you don't 
 Nigga, this ain't what you want 
 Think 'cause I went to prison I won't put the pistol to yo dome 
 Don't get it fucked up 
 Don't get it fucked up 
 You know you don't want these problems 
 Nigga, you know you don't want these problems 
 Nigga, don't get it fucked up 
 Don't get it fucked up 
 You know you don't want these problems 
 Nigga, you know you don't want these problems 
 NO tip, I got these hoes 
 Live it way, got a sake pose 
 Covered it like wear ladies flows 
 New York bitch, real lady clothes 
 Put 'em all now, real nigga act 
 Better put it now 
 You better go for the Oscars 
 'Cause impostors will get whack niggas that's mobsters 
 That ain't playing that 
 Niggas wanna sleep, I lay 'em down 
 Shine it, you see the way around, no recess in this circle 
 We don't play around 
 With my zig-zags I J down this motherfucker real quick 
 'Cause life be her bitch 
 Will I'm gon' serve hers big dick 
 Boy this Compton, driving lane 
 Me and y'all, it's 'bout the same 
 Same nigga without the game 
 Keep shit, it ain't potty trained 
 Big bucks like a Shawty bang, bad boy with that naughty chain 
 Big stripes like referees but home boy this is not a game 
 So, break bread with the real bruh 
 Make sure you live life till it kill ya 
 Drop another molly in my tequila 
 To my life in my dreams, La Familia 
 Don't get it fucked up 
 Don't get it fucked up 
 You know you don't want these problems 
 Nigga, you know you don't want these problems 
 Nigga, don't get it fucked up 
 Don't get it fucked up 
 You know you don't want these problems 
 Nigga, you know you don't want these problems 
 Off the drama and I'm back nigga 
 Still a king and that's a fact nigga 
 Fuck talkin', I'm that nigga 
 That's one deep, no pact nigga 
 Bad boy, no act nigga 
 No internet, but I'm at niggas 
 New McLaren, all black nigga 
 That's front and Center like Shaq nigga 
 In the game but don't play round 
 Try this shit with me - you get laid down 
 I stick and move, I don't stay round 
 Make the hardest nigga turn greyhound 
 I don't talk the talk, I just run shit 
 How you think you're me but ain't the shit 
 Could go bananas on some shit 
 I keep a team on that dumb shit 
 I keep a strap that just might clap 
 Money low and I might trap 
 Yeah I'm on it, fuck my opponent 
 He run up on me, I might snap 
 Got me feelin' like fuck em 
 I'm face to face, I don't duck em 
 My heat in hand, I don't tuck em 
 I don't body bag em, I stuff em 
 With hot shit, hot shit 
 Yeah I'm talkin' bout hot shit 
 With heavy metals I rock shit 
 Till showin' 'bove but you not shit 
 I go for real, just ask T.I.P 
 I green light my get trip 
 Six niggas hoppin' out one whip 
 Go there re-constructin your whole whip 
 Don't get it fucked up 
 Don't get it fucked up 
 You know you don't want these problems 
 Nigga, you know you don't want these problems 
 Nigga, don't get it fucked up 
 Don't get it fucked up

 Nigga, you know you don't want these problems
