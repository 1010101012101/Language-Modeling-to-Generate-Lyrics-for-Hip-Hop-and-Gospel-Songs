... You might have seen me on the tube 
 With your little son or daughter eyes glued to the screen 
 But ain't it as bad as it seem 
 Now could you imagine in your wildest dreams 
 Comin' from nothin' making somethin' out your wildest dreams 
 Been hustlin since a pre-teen it must be in my genes 
 Knot in my starter coat 'bout a g in my jeans 
 It's the reason why the streets crowned me as the king 
 And why robber crews don't mind seein me bling 
 Man I'm a seven time felon how you bein with me? 
 From running through house? and the caine fifty thousand? 
 Scream my name and sing the same song that I spit flames on 
 Broad shoulder body part they tattoo my name on 
 Hey I think you muthafuckas got the game wrong 
 I came to bring game to the game and turn the lame off 
 Sucka niggas keep hatin' I'm a flame on 
 Wherever there's a fire sire? sut to place the flame on? 
 Okay first things first 
 Fuck what you think you know 'bout me 
 You crack-pushin petty thief man that's so not me 
 You heard the album read a magazine, oh I see 
 Well I'll admit I've got a past I don't care to repeat 
 But I ain't half as bad as niggas you comparin with me 
 Rich or poor you still a nigga that's apparent to me 
 But transition from the streets I know you'll rarely be seen 
 That's duely noted, still your profilers embarassin me 
 Got me under investigation because of my association 
 With niggas I barely know by they faces ain't know relation 
 I mean for pete sake, how much pressure from the police in each state can a young g take? 
 I'm dyin' to eat steak with a mil in each safe 
 Got a crib with a gate so my kids can be safe 
 Tryin' to fly straight, these chances I take 
 Could end a good night and ruin a nice day 
 Hey you watchin? you goin' see, you barkin up the wrong tree 
 Just 'cause I'm a seven time felon ho-mie 
 In addition to the lies snitches tellin' on me 
 I don't mean you can put the dope they were sellin on me
