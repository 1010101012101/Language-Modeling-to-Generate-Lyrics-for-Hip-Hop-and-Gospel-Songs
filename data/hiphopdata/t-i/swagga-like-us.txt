 Kanye West 
 Mr. West is in the building 
 Swagger on a hundred thousand trillion 
 Ay yo, I know I got it first 
 I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the pilgrims 
 Thanksgiving, do we even gotta question? 
 Hermes Pastelle, I pass the dressing 
 My attitude is tattooed, that mean it's permanent 
 So I guess I should address it, huh? 
 My swagger is Mick Jagger 
 Every time I breathe on the track, I asthma attack it 
 Why he's so mad for, why he got a habit? 
 'Cause I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master 
 Na na Nn, how it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine? 
 Na na na (Na na) Tryin' to get that Kobe number, one over Jordan

 Jay-Z 
 Yeah, gotta bop like this 
 Can't wear skinny jeans 'cause my knots don't fit 
 No one on the corner got a pocket like this 
 So I rock Roc jeans cuz my knot's so thick 
 You can learn how to dress just by checkin' my fresh 
 Checkin' checkin' my fresh, checkin' checkin' my fresh 
 Follow my steps, it's the road to success 
 Where the niggas know you thorough and the girls say yes (Yes) 
 But I can't teach you my swag 
 You can pay for school but you can't buy class 
 School of Hard Knocks, I'm a grad 
 And that all-blue yankee is my graduation cap (It's Hova) 
 Dipping different rovers, whippin' with the soda (Hova) 
 Could you even have any doubt after Doubt it was over? 
 No one on the corner have swagger like us

 Lil Wayne 
 No one on the corner has swagger like moi, 
 Church, but I'm too clean for the choir 
 I require what I desire 
 I got stripes, Adidas 
 Mami scream, "Papi, no más" 
 Run up in your shit, just me, no más 
 Runnin' this shit like I got four thighs 
 No one has swagger like these four guys 
 And when it comes to styles, I got several 
 Sharper than a swagger, dagger all metal 
 And my jewels, blue and yellow 
 The type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo 
 Rules as follows: stay true to the ghetto 
 Write your name on the bullet, make you feel special 
 Ha, what the fuck you boys talkin' 'bout? 
 I know it's us 'cause we the only thing you talk about 
 No one on the corner have swagger like us 
 Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us (And I'm done) 
 No one on the corner have swagger like us 
 Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us (Bye) 
 No one on the corner have swagger like us 
 Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us (Yeah) 
 No one on the corner have swagger like us (Ha, you think?) 
 Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us (That's right) 
 T.I. 
 Ay, you go see Weezy for the wordplay, Jeezy for the bird play 
 Kan-yeezy for diversity and me for controversy 
 On my verses, picture perfect; on that spittin,' serve a purpose 
 Ye ain't livin' what you kickin,' then you worthless 
 Looking from the surface, it may seem like I got reason to be nervous 
 Then observe my work and see that my adversity was worth it 
 Verses autobiographical, absolutely classical 
 Last thing I'm worried 'bout is what another rapper do 
 Ain't nobody hot as me, even if they rap they ass off 
 Blast off and have outstanding qualities 
 Sell a lot of records, I respect it and salute that 
 But spittin' real life on hot beats, I'm the truth at 
 You kick it like me, no exaggeration necessary 
 Livin' revolutionary, nothin' less than legendary 
 Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad 
 Flow colder than February with extraordinary swag 
 No one on the corner have swagger like us (Ok) 
 Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us (Yeah, that's right) 
 No one on the corner have swagger like us (Ok) 
 Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us (Yeah, so you noticed, huh?) 
 No one on the corner have swagger like us (Ha, yeah) 
 Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us (Ok, tell 'em for me, shawty) 
 No one on the corner have swagger like us (Yeah, that's right) 
 Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us (Yeah) 
 No one on the corner have swagger like us 
 Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us 
 No one on the corner have swagger like us 
 Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us 
 No one on the corner have swagger like us 
 Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us 
 No one on the corner have swagger like us 
 Swagger like us, swagger swagger like us 
 Like us, like us, like us, like us, like us...
