(Ludacris (T.I.)) 
 (Here we go!) 
 Surprise nigga 
 It was bound to happen sooner or later 
 (They ain't ready for this) 
 History has been made 
 ATL, yeah 
 'Cause I got it 
 All these haters wanna grill me 
 (But fuck that I'm about my money if it kills me) 
 (Yeah baby) 
 (And I'm up to no good) 
 Hey I wish a motherfucker would 
 This the a-town, come into my hood 
 Hey I wish a motherfucker would 
 Houston, Dallas come into they hood 
 Hey I wish a motherfucker would 
 (Ludacris) 
 I keep a fresh pair of one's on my feet 
 And double deuces on the Chevy 
 3's company the double 4's on my belly 
 5 hot amps speakers shake like jelly 
 So many wires in my trunk look like a bowl of spaghetti 
 Assault and batteries, but my trunk stay "ever ready" 
 Assault and battery if you scared you never ready 
 And yeah I went green, and 26's on the hybrid 
 Smoked so much green that I can't open up my eyelids 
 Wake up in London, go to sleep on Atlanta time 
 Still my paint got more candy then your valentine 
 For 5 mill I bought a lake front crib 
 Bentley car cover looking like a laced front wig 
 Of course they hating 'cause they still riding the martor train 
 Re-name the yacht but put the plane in my daughters name 
 Now that's karma so call me daddy war bucks 
 If you got money, I got more bucks 
 New york and jersey come into they hood 
 Hey I wish a motherfucker would 
 L.a. and the bay come into they hood 
 Hey I wish a motherfucker would 
 (Ludacris) 
 Luda! 
 I'm a freak like a scorpio 
 Custom hood scoops make the coupe look like pinocchio 
 I'm rich bitch, I should drop cash 
 The inside of the lac' look like a wood shop class 
 And these women gimme "love" like it's tennis time 
 So many shoes that my closet look like finish line 
 So many acres that my crib look like Bermuda 
 So many diamonds the safe look like Kay jewelers 
 That spider about to drop my team said Luda get it 
 Now 50 thou says that I'm the first nigga with it 
 First round draft pick, later for you imbeciles 
 The car is all black like it got traded to the timberwolves 
 And I keep a little bit of that green up in the lining 
 But as the weather change my weed adjust to different climates (ok) 
 Green in the summer time, orange in the spring 
 Now it's black with that purp I call my whip the "sac king" 
 Chi-town and Detroit, come into they hood 
 Hey I wish a motherfucker would 
 D.c and b-more, come into they hood 
 Hey I wish a motherfucker would 
 (T.i.) 
 I'm fly enough to fly away 
 Trouble I don't shy away 
 From it I annihilate suckers in they driveway 
 In church on Sunday morning praying about what happened Friday 
 But them the consequences for coming at pimping sideways 
 Now a days guess it pays to change 
 In cahoots with corporations making major change 
 With magnificent watches and amazing chains 
 Plush pad in Atlanta and l.a.'s the same 
 I'm balling till I'm bored with selections and assortments 
 Of automotives worth a small fortune 
 Of course it's the '72 Chevelle hardtop, '69 drop 
 60 carat piece you can barely pay your lease 
 Dude wanna talk new school tell him go ahead 
 Drop head double r-Maybachs and corner sales 
 Swag got the ass, stack cash to the hair line 
 Fuck another car it's time to try an buy a airline 
 Miami to Alabama, come into they hood 
 Hey I wish a motherfucker would 
 Philly and Boston, come into they hood 
 Hey I wish a motherfucker would 
 St. Louis to Tennessee, come into they hood 
 Phoenix to v.a, come into they hood 
 Ohio and Indiana, come into they hood 
 Mississippi to Carolinas, come into they hood 
 And little rock, come into they hood 
 Oklahoma to Louisiana, come into they hood 
 Kansas city to Seattle, come into they hood 
 Minneapolis to Milwaukee, come into they hood
