(B.o.B) 
 We don't get down like y'all 
 We don't get down like y'all 
 Sucka nigga, we don't get down like y'all! 
 (T.I.) 
 It's been a lot of back and forth over this and that 
 So I don't pick the bobo no more, I just get it, fact! 
 Listen, pimpin', let me tell you what the business here 
 Y'all know some so imma tell you what the difference here 
 See, we're old school, you're just old news 
 We used to move blow, and you just blow dude 
 See we the talk of the town, me and my whole crew 
 You run around town gossip, like the hoe do 
 See you name drop when nobody knows you 
 We get the lames out our sector, like we 'posed to 
 My crew, we cop the Bentley, Brooklyn, and the Rolls too 
 You give her roses, I'm the one she bring the rose to 
 So you say you're shining, well I guess I'm shining more 
 So high up, I'm soaring thirty, I'm like a dinosaur, carnivore 
 (Meat) Me year, G they respect, 
 Me to you like a comparing a vet to a cadet, nigga 
 (B.o.B) 
 We don't get down like y'all 
 I ball, I do, you talk 
 I'm real, you flaw 
 'Cause nigga, we don't get down like you! 
 Sucka nigga, we don't get down like you! 
 (T.I.) 
 Don't call it a comeback 
 Getting right, being from the fed pen 
 Pull up on them suckers, pop the trunk and tell 'em get in! 
 I thought I lost well guess again 
 Back to balling, getting bread, bring the checks in 
 Yeah, like we did on my last case 
 I show you how to make a blessing out of bad breaks 
 Hey, let me set you niggas ass straight 
 Hoe want their clothes back, loosen up fag bait! 
 Them hot pants bad for your prostate 
 Lime green high, pink up drag queen, hot date 
 At stores asking for the same size the bitches buy 
 They say it's hip, but where I'm from we call it sissified 
 (B.o.B) 
 We don't get down like y'all 
 I ball, I do, you talk 
 I'm real, you flaw 
 'Cause nigga, we don't get down like you! 
 Sucka nigga, we don't get down like you! 
 (T.I.) 
 Before us, there was none, after us, no more than ever be 
 This is the greatest show on Earth you ever seen 
 I still do it for my nigga in the streets, getting into 
 Blowing money like my nigga, Big Meach just to do it 
 Say we're blowing money fast, big old money bag 
 Three, four hundred cash just to make them suckers mad 
 Back in the saddle, the winner of every battle 
 Been the best since I was rapping in the rattle, world travel 
 As you comment on the rumors of what have, you beware dude 
 Prayer can't prepare you, how dare you 
 Disrespect my presence peasants, I will tear you, 
 A new one, I poop on, your egos and move on 
 Rolls Royce back seat, no great coupon 
 A true don, three piece cashmere suit on 
 Peon, see it ain't no neon on my new ones 
 Hear the truth on every song I spew on, Bloaw 
 (B.o.B) 
 We don't get down like y'all 
 I ball, I do, you talk 
 I'm real, you flaw 
 'Cause nigga, we don't get down like you! 
 Sucka nigga, we don't get down like you!
