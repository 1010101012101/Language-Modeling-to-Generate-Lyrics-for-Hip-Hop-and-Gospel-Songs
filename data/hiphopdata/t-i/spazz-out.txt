You better fall back, nigga gon wit all that

 You better fall back, nigga gon wit all that 
 Imma big dawg, got no time for small cats 
 And I been known, most of you guys is all rap 
 Hide behind rhymes discised in all black 
 I'm in the end zone, moving the chain winning the game 
 Not a ten clone saying my name to get in the game 
 Wait a minute homes, first of all let it known I'm bout that business homes 
 So all the flexing and the lying you can kill it homes 
 You just a cub imma lion (Don't forgot it homes) 
 Listen I'm out yo division homes 
 My name written in stones on the throne that I'm sitting on 
 Long term like a great Britten homes 
 Spitting strong in a zone on the microphone I'm the sickest known 
 Everybody's ego I be pissing on 
 Getting blown riding through the city on big chrome 
 Sitting under something that you thought I cudnt fit 'em on 
 Anyway say we cut to the chase and get to straight nitty gritty homes 
 Way you bitch and moan, like a broad you need titty's on 
 And I'm straight don't get me wrong, shawty I ain't in to dudes 
 Talk about your music not about me in your interviews 
 Seem like every time I'm rapping, imma offending dudes 
 And I ain't thought about you, let alone mention you... 
 Outro : (T.I. talking) 
 Mlk DJ drama 
 I just wanna let these niggas know I don't need no goddamn mixtape homes 
 I got 150 songs, I mean I got 150 songs on deck my nigga 
 I mean on some real shit, I'll give this shit to you, if you want it nigga 
 Really... all you gotta say is "Tip we miss you dawg", Tip "we wanna hear ya dawg" 
 Then I'll goddamn throw some shit out there homes 
 But don't goddamn go comparing me to a nigga who done dropped 3 mixtapes 
 When I done dropped 7 ALbums my nigga 
 I don't wanna hear this shit nigga... 
 Fuck you saying? 
 Nigga my son got better songs then you nigga 
 Ay digg on some real shit 
 Next time I hear another muthafucka comparing my album to a muthafucking mixtape... 
 Imma walk up to ya my nigga, AND IMMA SLAP YA WIT A STACK OF 50s NIGGA SAY IM LYING 
 Thank it's a muthafuckin game, fuck a mixtape nigga!
