I used to dream (I used to dream), oh whoa 
 About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls) 
 But now I sing (now I sing), oh whoa 
 Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world) 
 And now I sing, sing, sing, sing, 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world 
 And now I sing, sing, sing, sing, 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world 
 T.I.: 
 Man I remember, before I say that, wait, let me issue this statement 
 No way should reflection be mistaken for glorification 
 Now, I remember so vivid, me and my niggas was living 
 Sub-standard condition, still handling business 
 Still laughing and tripping, still having the bitches 
 I'm rapping now, reminiscing, and God damn it, we did it 
 From trapping, standing, and pitching with rich, we stand in the kitchen 
 Splitting it eight ways, flipping it eight days 
 Thought that while in a room it was just the way to behave 
 Kept the weight and the yey for most the paper we made in all dimes 
 I ain't lying, the pleasure was all mine 
 Have big work to move, but we served the small time 
 I always outshined the niggas with small minds 
 Who would have thought we would be arguably the greatest of all time? 
 Around here, we developed such a sound down here 
 But duplicate it off the steel, it can only be found here 
 Only listen to G's, that other shit I don't hear 
 Shit, they so far in the rear, why would I even care 
 I'm too busy being a player, staring at niggas careers 
 But talk about it for years and now we finally here 
 I used to dream (I used to dream), oh whoa 
 About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls) 
 But now I sing (now I sing), oh whoa 
 Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world) 
 And now I sing, sing, sing, sing, 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world 
 And now I sing, sing, sing, sing, 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world 
 Ludacris: 
 They say what goes up must come down, but I ain't reached my cruising altitude 
 Take a look at what I did, but can you imagine what I'm about to do? 
 The places I'm bout to go, and the money I'm bout to see 
 Gave Bill Gates some binoculars and said "look out for me!" 
 Exceeded expectations, even at Def Jam 
 'Cause I married the streets and Atlanta has been my best man 
 My momma quit her job and now she works with six figures 
 'Cause I'm a self-made, nappy-headed, rich nigga 
 Private planes help me travel in peace 
 To four cities in one day and four countries in one week 
 'Cause I work for myself and no one else 'cause I'm too smart to 
 Put one of my partners right through culinary art school 
 Now he my personal chef, so that bread he get it 
 Put them all in houses, cleaned up all of my friends credit 
 And now they witness all the glitz and the glamor 
 Catch us eating at straits Atlanta with women with table manners 
 Order in Singapore and lobster 
 Celebrating coming from nothing to winning Grammys and rappers winning Oscars 
 And they say rappers shouldn't act nah suckers 
 We see Samuel Jackson like what's up mother fucker?! 
 I used to dream (I used to dream), oh whoa 
 About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls) 
 But now I sing (now I sing), oh whoa 
 Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world) 
 And now I sing, sing, sing, sing, 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world 
 And now I sing, sing, sing, sing, 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world 
 T.I.: 
 I know them haters don't stop plotting and wish you would fall 
 'Cause I'm standing on top looking down at it all 
 I see you down there to y'all, it seems like I got it all 
 Homie I ain't get enough, I'm still trying to triple up 
 It's why we got StreetCred and a cool building up 
 Say I'm doing too much, shit, I say I ain't did enough 
 Remember saying "Damn, if I could just get to a million plus" 
 And now I'm like "Shit, what the fuck is a million bucks?" 
 Triple that on my bun thanks to bigs and run 
 But nevermind what I've been through, just look at what I become 
 All the shit I've avoided, what I done for my sons 
 And daughters, and momma, just call her 
 I sold dope and dropped out of school seems it's all they can see 
 They don't notice none of my family did that since me 
 I broke that cycle, now my family live a life of 
 Mandatory minimals, but not when the judge sentence them 
 Cousins in college, where you think they get tuition from? 
 Jeffrey standing around wishing huh 
 And while you standing around looking dumb 
 I make it happen, taking action over time, got damn good at it 
 I used to dream (I used to dream), oh whoa 
 About the money and the cars and girls (and the girls) 
 But now I sing (now I sing), oh whoa 
 Because I'm sitting on top of the world (the whole world) 
 And now I sing, sing, sing, sing, 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world 
 And now I sing, sing, sing, sing, 'cause I'm sitting on top of the world
