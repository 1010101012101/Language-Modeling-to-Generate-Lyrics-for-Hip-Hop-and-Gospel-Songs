I know it can get kinda tough sometimes you know 
 I know you can kinda get carried away with yourself 
 But err, why don't you be real with me and be real with you at the same time 
 You can't get what you get here nowhere else ma 
 Keep it real now 
 You know, You know (you know you love this) 
 You know you love this life 
 Don't nobody do you like me 
 You know, you love 
 You-you know you love this life 
 Don't nobody do you like me 
 You know 
 Cavalli dress and high heels 
 And drop tops on hot wheels 
 We live how we wanna live 'cause we got mills 
 Them other barely barely buy a hot meal 
 In VIP dem bottle poppin' do it B.I.G. 
 Come get with T.I.P. be ballin' till you D-I-E 
 Invisible set bracelet, see clearly 
 Take away your stress mean that sincerely 
 Problem solve 'em, nevermind that 
 Girlfriend see your bag, be like "Where you find that?" 
 Plus, what's a what's a pre-nup you ain't got to sign that 
 You up take half, imma make it right back 
 I'm a hustla hustla to the heart 
 What's the sense in leaving me and be back with them with-them busters 
 Bentley for your birthday, Goyard Purse day 
 Deal with them stacks know you gotta love that 
 Man of Respect on a big jet 
 With a big big and a big check 
 I pop big shit, how good does it get 
 Ya leave me, where else you think you could get this? 
 Yeah, you could get another guy to beat that beat that for ya 
 Them busters cowards though, and I'll take a bullet for you 
 Mansions, jewelry all I need is for you and me to have some understanding 
 Have a couple candid conversations 
 Your frustrations I take in consideration 
 I'm rough around the edges, don't bat with me and be patient 
 And you're sadly mistaken if you think I'm into chasing 
 My heart is RSVP I've extended an invitation 
 And don't go wasting your time with what they saying online 
 Your positions divine, don't believe look around 
 I got a strong mind and kind heart 
 With a soft kiss but I love hard 
 Don't you love this life like I love you 
 Anything you could ask, do it for you 
 Drop Jags, Berkin bags, Louboutin heels 
 Summer homes in Miami, Hollywood hills 
 Vacation in Monaco, Ibiza 
 On the French Riviera with our feet up 
 Our lifestyles so rare, you know you ain't going nowhere
