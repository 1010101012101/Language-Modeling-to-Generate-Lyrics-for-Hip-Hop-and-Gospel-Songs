(Chorus: x2 (T.I.)) 
 Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean 
 Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean 
 Ay, get it right, two step and let your shoulder lean, let your shoulder lean 
 Just let your shoulder lean 
 Dro... I'm clean in this bitch 
 Now I'm finna shoulder lean in this bitch 
 Dro... carbon 15 in this bitch 
 This Grand Hustle team of kings is gettin' rich 
 I lean and get lit, lima bean 6 
 I take breath, the opposite of Primatine Mist 
 I ride 26 and let my 9 scream "flip" 
 Dro be watchin' Oprah, Mac, 9 up in a clip 
 Triple black Phantom nigga nah it ain't Tip 
 With Lucky Charms down and man but nah it ain't Flip 
 K bounce... ok then I let my shoulder lean 
 And I bet my car charge, and I bet my motor clean 
 Suicide doors, Brown Rover look like pok 'n' bean 
 Erybody know me in the club 'cause they smokin' me... Dro 
 Hoes scopin' me, ice come from Bo Bareeton 
 Hundred carats have 'em froze for an eon 
 Red, black, and white Chevy now I'm ridin' Deion 
 Put them lights off in my rims, now I'm ridin' neon 
 Our cars look like cra-yon, hoes know I'm the man though 
 I can shoulder lean... ionno how to dance thooooo 
 First I let my wheels spin, then I let my screen fall 
 Then I let my trunk beat at Greenbriar Mall, tall 
 And then I pimp a hoe, take a bitch to Berlin 
 Bitch break niggaz, after that we fuck they girlfriend 
 My girl got a girlfriend, Chevy blue like whirlwind 
 Nigga it's a drought on that boy, so I got that girl in 
 Pearl Bent', cockin' hammer, Arm and Hammer propaganda 
 Bitches think I'm pimpin' and leanin' in salamander sandels 
 Dirty South hot 'cause Atlanta... show niggaz with ammo 
 We ride Phantom, holla shawty for grammar 
 Yep, now I be on TV, BET, out the channel 
 Hood nigga from Bankhead, I stay by Grandma Nana 
 I lay by my banana, dumpin' and punkin' monkeys 
 Don't nobody live with my mama but a bunch of junkies 
 Throw me the donkey, bitch I ride glaze on the haze 
 Gator green Chevy, gator gut, alligator J's 
 Lean, lean [Repeat: x 8] 
 Get ya shoulder shawty
