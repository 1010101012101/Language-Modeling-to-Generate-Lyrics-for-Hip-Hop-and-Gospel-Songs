Black jeans, white tee 
 Black rims, white B 
 Eight figure nigga, small digits don't excite me 
 Iced out brightly, shine like lightning 
 Everything bad bout my bitches but they hygiene 
 Turned up hyphy, every time you see me on 
 Matter fact, you can't see me 
 'Less you turn your TV on 
 Ay, we beyond that peon shit 
 That he be on 
 I stunt, ball daily 
 Fuck y'all, pay me 
 Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it 
 My life like a movie 
 Call me Martin Scorsese 
 On five blazin', burnin' hot cajun 
 Ay dude, fuck it 
 Every time you see me out 
 Just take yo' ho' and 
 We be out 
 We throwin' 'bands and goin' HAM, no doubt 
 You know what we be 'bout 
 Ballin' out the frame 
 Stuntin' like a fool 
 (x4) 
 Ay you know how we do 
 Stuntin' like a fool
