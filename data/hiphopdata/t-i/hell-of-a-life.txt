It's the king representing once more, you understand? 
 When people see me on Bankhead man on four star point, yelling screaming and waving 
 I don't wanna roll over no toes in my Rolls 
 You just back up and let a pimp pass through you dig? 
 Beamers, Bentleys, double R's, Ferraris 
 Every time I see a shorty 
 Where you headed tonight? 
 (Hey, where you headed shorty?) 
 Sellin' out arenas, chicks with asses like Serena 
 Man, shorty live a hell of a life 
 Hell of a life 
 (I'm tryin' to tell you shorty) 
 Man, shorty live a hell of a live 
 (This is how I live, real talk, true story) 
 I ain't tellin' no lies 
 Man, shorty live a hell of a life 
 (I'm tryin' to tell you shorty, this is how I live, real talk, true story) 
 You know shorty goin' extra hard when they release his passport 
 Why I need a credit card? What you think this cash for? 
 Hit the dealership and give them every dime he ask for 
 Just so I can see 260 on the dashboard 
 If shinin' against the law, somebody better get the task force 
 Fuuny, hoes love me, let me fuck 'em till they ass hoarse 
 Pimpin' 101, just come and see me, take a crash course 
 You wanna count my money? Go to college, need a math course 
 On a mad dash for 100 milli runnin' 
 Breakneck speed till I see a billi comin' 
 I'm built to reach a hundred, feel the grumblin' in my stomach 
 I'm still stunting off the chain, chasing nothin' for my money 
 With a couple pair of queens, like I'm playing gin rummy 
 No cards, just broads when a nigga dick hard 
 Flooded offshore, automall lookin' like a car star 
 Put it in a wristwatch 
 Ballin' like a big shot 
 Beamers, Bentleys, double R's, Ferraris 
 Every time I see a shorty 
 Where you headed tonight? 
 (Hey, where you headed shorty?) 
 Sellin' out arenas, chicks with asses like Serena 
 Man, shorty live a hell of a life 
 Hell of a life

 Swag on fully, no semi ho, hemi 
 Bankrolls, no gimmicks, drop Rolls, no Emmys 
 Street cred, no blemish, credit card, no limit 
 You want Bankhead a spot to drop heads, I'm in it 
 Been it, a couple of corners hoppin' on 20 
 With 3 or 4 women givin' love like tennis 
 All my boxes with the Chinese, givin' me the business 
 While I'mma through the city, gag, swallow, no spitting 
 Livin' life like I just got out of prison Wednesday night 
 If your chick is in my sight, then that chick is getting right 
 Hey, I know niggas now with bitches think I'm hittin' and they right 
 They keep my name out they mouth and mind they business, it's aight 
 They aight if you see me say aight, okay, aight 
 'Cause you know I got the goons with me and I pay aight 
 If hey would like to see me go back to prison, see me go 
 But instead they see me ballin', stuntin' everywhere we go, go

 Mind your own phone, pockets so swoll' 
 Rubber band keep poppin' off my bankroll 
 I ain't tellin' no lies 
 Man shorty live a hell of a life 
 (This is how I live, real talk, true story) 
 Brand new cars for my brand new chicks 
 A hundred bands right fixing to see a man 
 I ain't tellin' no lies 
 Man, shorty live a hell of a life 
 (This is how I live, real talk, true story)
