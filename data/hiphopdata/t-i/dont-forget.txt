(Mary j. blige chorus) 
 Don't forget to remember me 
 Don't forget (get get) to remember me (x2) 
 Please keep me in your heart 
 If we ever have to part 
 Don't forget (get get) to remember me 
 (T.i. verse 1) 
 I'm the modern day Martin luther, malcom x 
 I'm officially the freshest don't dare forget 
 I'm gone, momentarily don't bear me yet 
 Like ali got I got title back compare me to dat 
 When the world needed tip 
 Ask where he was at 
 But where he need something back 
 Nigga fade to black 
 Talking shit behind his back 
 You a hater for that 
 I don't expect nothing less 
 In a game of chess you think 5 moves ahead and not behind 
 Niggas jumped up cheered when I got my time 
 Like yeah, one whole year I got to grind 
 But get me losing off your mind 
 Shorty may I remind you 
 That there ain't another nigga who done been through what I been through 
 Time aftter time again you better get some ? in you 
 When you said it was over for him and you thought he couldn't continue to floss 
 Heres to your memory loss 
 Suckkka 
 (Mary j. blige chorus) 
 Don't forget (get get) to remember me (x3) 
 Please keep me in your heart 
 If we ever have to part 
 Don't forget forget to remember me 
 (T.i. verse 2) 
 They say out of sight is out of mind 
 And 9 times out of 10 me and (out of pocket out of line) ? 
 You do it big everybody that you out shined 
 In yo ole lady face talm about how she got fine 
 She say she trying to get away 
 He say about time 
 Right now we all thinking damn hope it's not mine 
 But when its lights out for you and you locked down 
 Ain't not telling whether or not your lady when and got down 
 With that nigga cross town 'cause he hot now 
 Ripping up your love letters, lifting up her night gown 
 Right now somebody baby moma gettin' piped down 
 Kids in the next room listening, mama pipe down 
 The thought hurt don't it 
 But maybe she strong enough or ain't get that lonely cause you wasn't gone long enough 
 Trust 
 Its just a temporarily setback 
 Its on when I get back 
 Please don't forget dat 
 (Mary j. blige chorus) 
 Don't forget to remember me 
 Don't forget (please don't) to remember me 
 Please keep me in your heart 
 If we ever have to part 
 Don't forget (get get) to remember me 
 (Mary j. blige verse 1) 
 I don't mean to feel like this 
 Don't mean to think like this 
 My heart just has to be shown 
 That the love that I give to you 
 That's the love that I get from you 
 I need to be safe and secure 
 Don't forget don't forget to remember me 
 Please remember me 
 Everything I bring to this love love 
 Please keep me in your heart 
 If we ever have to part 
 Don't forget (get) to remember me 
 Don't you ... forget about me
