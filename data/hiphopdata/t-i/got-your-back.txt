(Chorus: Keri Hilson & T.I.) 
 I got your back boy 
 We were high 
 We were low 
 But I promise I will never let you go 
 Said I got I got I got I got your back boy 
 I got I got I got I got your back boy 
 (I know you got my back right) 
 Keep my swagger 
 Keep it looking good for ya 
 Keep it looking hood for ya 
 Shawty if you don't know 
 I got I got I got I got your back boy 
 (T.I. Verse 1) 
 Hey it's whatever shawty 
 You ain't gotta ask 
 Yes Valentino blouses, summer houses, cash, check! 
 You can get it you deserve it, flawless diamonds, Louie purses, 
 My mission's to purchase Earth for her 
 Present the gifts without the curse 
 Her pleasure is my purpose 
 Pleasure to be at your service 
 Front row at fashion shows as well as Sunday morning service 
 But better days or for worse 
 If I'm paid I'm hurting in my pocket 
 She still got a nigga back that's for sure 
 No matter what may occur in life 
 Everyday with her is like a plus 
 I'mma love her till she be like that's enough 
 Pop a bottle get a couple wine glasses fill 'em up and lift 'em up 
 Let us toast to the future here's to us 
 No, here's to her 
 (Keri Hilson - Bridge) 
 THey wonder how we do what we do 
 Panamera Porsches me and you 
 Stuck to your side like, like, like glue 
 Be by your side whatever your gonna do 
 (Chorus: Keri Hilson & T.I.) 
 I got your back boy 
 We were high 
 We were low 
 But I promise I will never let you go 
 Said I got I got I got I got your back boy 
 I got I got I got I got your back boy 
 (I know you got my back right) 
 Keep my swagger 
 Keep it looking good for ya 
 Keep it looking hood for ya 
 Shawty if you don't know 
 I got I got I got I got your back boy 
 (T.I. Verse 2) 
 This is for the women who man caught a sentence 
 Who gon be there for a minute but they didn't keep their distance 
 They stayed home waiting on the phone 
 And on visit day show up looking good smelling better, playing kissy face 
 Just wanna let you know we appreciate 
 Everything you do for us on a day to day 
 And I know we don't show you all the time but we lucky that you ours 
 No bouquet of flowers could ever show how much we know we need you 
 We do all that's in our power just to please you 
 See boo, fuck them girls I would leave the World before I leave you 
 May God say even eve and adam ain't got shit on these two 
 (Keri Hilson - Bridge) 
 THey wonder how we do what we do 
 Panamera Porsches me and you 
 Stuck to your side like, like, like glue 
 Be by your side whatever your gonna do 
 (Chorus: Keri Hilson & T.I.)

 We were high 
 We were low 
 But I promise I will never let you go

 Keep my swagger 
 Keep it looking good for ya 
 Keep it looking hood for ya 
 Shawty if you don't know 
 I got I got I got I got your back boy 
 (T.I. Verse 3) 
 Show love 
 Even though them chicks be hating on us 
 Still I'm gonna keep her by my side 
 In whatever situation we gon ride 
 Make all my fantasie's come alive 
 That's no lie now 
 I'll be all right as long as your gon be beside me 
 10 million dollar mansions won't suffice 
 If you ain't gon be in there with me at night 
 The pieces to my puzzle's in my life 
 With all of my good days and all of my bad 
 You stood by your man and you know you got my back 
 Worth every car every bag with me they wanna be that 
 I know what I got at home 
 I ain't never gon leave that 
 Them bitches best believe that 
 (Chorus: Keri Hilson & T.I.) 
 I got your back boy 
 We were high 
 We were low 
 But I promise I will never let you go 
 Said I got I got I got I got your back boy 
 I got I got I got I got your back boy 
 (I know you got my back right) 
 Keep my swagger 
 Keep it looking good for ya 
 Keep it looking hood for ya 
 Shawty if you don't know 
 I got I got I got I got your back boy
