(Feat. Akon) 
 Konvict music 
 Grand hustle movement 
 You know what this is partner 
 Yeah 
 (Chorus: Akon) 
 We get it poppin' on site 
 I'm sure you already know my steno 
 See I've never been a buster just a true hustler 
 My squad is lethal 
 Come with the right price 
 I can make you look bigger than neno 
 Just put a gun in your hand and let you ride with the man 'cause I'm a muther fucking hero 
 T.I.: 
 Just to make sure he don't get it clear like pallegreeno from acseno to a kilo I'm a neighborhood hero 
 They be talking love but they never seen a key though 
 Never chop them 63's down to triple 0 
 Hate on me so much but I'm what you wanna be though 
 Might of went tiple platinum you ain't never been a g though 
 I keep the 50 with me tote it round like it legal 
 Fly like a segal, ride around with 3 girls 
 Keep it pimpin' with me you don't want to see those 
 So what we can meet up, you get your ass beat up 
 The reason people honor me the reason why you under me 
 You don't believe we run the street well come and see nigga 
 (Chorus: Akon) 
 We get it poppin' on site 
 I'm sure you already know my steno 
 See I've never been a buster just a true hustler 
 My squad is lethal 
 Come with the right price 
 I can make you look bigger than neno 
 Just put a gun in your hand and let you ride with the man 'cause I'm a muther fucking hero 
 T.I.: 
 I'm the man that's apparent even when I'm ruuning errands 
 Gotta beat a mcClaren on what I'm wearing got 'em staring 
 Bitches I share 'em if they in my hair em 
 They ain't getting high well I don't go near em 
 Nigga wanna die tell 'em buck I dare em 
 I ain't gonna spare 'em homie I'm gonna tear em 
 Apart from his heart to his ass swear to god 
 Give a fuck about his partner give a damn about a charge 
 I take it to far, pull up where ever you are 
 Empty clips in your new car 
 Picture you dead and zoom off 
 Admit it you lost, probly cause shawty to raw 
 You flaw ay tell 'em how we do dawg 
 (Chorus: Akon) 
 We get it poppin' on site 
 I'm sure you already know my steno 
 See I've never been a buster just a true hustler 
 My squad is lethal 
 Come with the right price 
 I can make you look bigger than neno 
 Just put a gun in your hand and let you ride with the man 'cause I'm a muther fucking hero 
 Akon: 
 Got a box of ammo that I rarely use 
 9 millimeter that shine like shoes 
 Hope the day never come when a nigga have to 
 Let it go ont he bust and hope it ain't you 
 'Cause I be on deck, on the grind like sex 
 Taking over local city street like feds 
 Breaking down every nickel, every dime, every brick 
 Down to the last dollar I mean every bit 
 (Chorus x2: Akon) 
 We get it poppin' on site 
 I'm sure you already know my steno 
 See I've never been a buster just a true hustler 
 My squad is lethal 
 Come with the right price 
 I can make you look bigger than neno 
 Just put a gun in your hand and let you ride with the man 'cause I'm a muther fucking hero
