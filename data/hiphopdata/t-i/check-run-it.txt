Ignant motherfucker please 
 You know exactly what a motherfucker need 
 I need a bag 'bout a hundred fifty Gs 
 You don't want us to make a motherfucking scene 
 Check, run it, all hundreds 4X 
 Check, run it 
 No broke shit in my life 
 'Cause I'm scared that shit could rub off on me 
 I'm superstitious, no lie 
 Check, run it 
 No broke shit in my life 2X 
 (1) 
 I tell you no lie 
 I be everywhere you go, guy 
 Over here every hoe who go by 
 Say that ni**a right there be so fly 
 Aye doubling up is all I'm about 
 Man one or two million kept all in the house 
 I'm calling them shot 
 Get all of them shots 
 Hate me till your stomach is all in or not 
 Boy I'm already hot I'm already rich 
 You better be gone, you lil bitty bi**h 
 You petty as shit, I'm real as it get 
 My ni**a Cap hear me say hit 'em with dick 
 Keep the fuck out your lingo 
 They be still inviting 'em and calling it swag 
 None of them ni**as you know 
 Fucking with me, you know it's all in the bag 
 Check 
 (Repeat) 
 (2) 
 I got a big cheque coming with the commas all on it 
 Audemar shine like some Armor All don't it 
 Fresh out of fucks giving in to my opponent 
 Tell him you can keep your baby mama I don't want it 
 I'mma go motherfucker man, better watch what you say 
 I ain't taking shit from no motherfucker man 
 Fuck a piece I want the whole motherfucking thing 
 Can you hear me? 
 Go tell the promoter hundred racks for an appearance 
 Go play in another city rap before I'm here 
 You a fuck ni**a 
 I know you ain't one of us, ni**a 
 She s**king everybody dick and you all in the club with her 
 Like you all in love with her 
 Everybody know what's up with her 
 Ay, run a hatchet like a flat pole 
 I've been getting it since Kermit the Frog was a tadpole 
 (Repeat)
