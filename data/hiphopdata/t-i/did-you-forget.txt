Say buddy you in my lane 
 You backin up the game 
 You lame 
 You want fame? 
 I can give it to yah daddy 
 I ain't took my meds for weeks 
 And I ain't feelin' fuckin' batty 
 So if I put the tip of this fifth 
 To your dick suckin lips 
 And I give yah the whole clip 
 Then we both get what we want 
 You get on the front page 
 And I get one less chump 
 I encourage all frauds to jump 
 I heard they taste like chicken 
 And my bitch is in the kitchen 
 With a pot of hot grease 
 And a couple side dishes 
 Go figure no meat 
 Slice this nigga up so we can eat 
 Kill the reeses on the raps 
 Trouble makers on the beat 
 You dudes be talkin' so street 
 And that talk be soundin tough 
 Until you gotta talk to me 
 The authentic is off limits 
 You don't talk to the truth 
 If you talkin' about gimics 
 I am the game I'm not in it 
 That means fifteen years not fifteen minutes nigga 
 Lets hear it for the bad guy 
 Clap when he get away 
 Live to kill another day 
 Heres a toast to the gun throats 
 Niggas who ain't the list that don't mind gun smoke 
 To my life time criminals 
 Remind 'em what fear is we tired of that whip shit 
 And if you feelin' how I'm feelin' 
 Put your drinks in the air for the law start killen 
 The call me reese they uno the sumo 
 Used to push D like kumo 
 You know I'm the realest nigga that do this 
 Got a crew of real spitters 
 That'll murder this new shit 
 I encourage the ladies stay away 
 From the techno papa today 
 That shit is gay 
 The good old years I talk about 
 Is when a loud mouth nigga still got stomped out 
 Now everybodys so passive aggressive 
 You'll get locked up teachin niggas a lesson 
 But its only so much testin 
 I can take before I break 
 And I expose my weapon 
 I might hit L.A rappin' 
 Last of the heat and start cars still beatin' 
 I'm on the west side geekin 
 This is the turf that I stick my cleats in 
 Lets hear it for the bad guy 
 Clap when he get away 
 Live to kill another day 
 Heres a toast to the gun throats 
 Niggas who ain't the list that don't mind gun smoke 
 To my life time criminals 
 Remind 'em what fear is we tired of that whip shit 
 And if you feelin' how I'm feelin' 
 Put your drinks in the air for the law start killen
