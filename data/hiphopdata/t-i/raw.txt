Ey, You niggas ain't raw 
 I don't buy none of that bullshit you tellin' me 
 King you'll never be 
 I can see you niggas ain't raw 
 Hell naw, give a damn who you go and get 
 Real niggas know it 
 We can notice that you niggas ain't raw 
 Even though that you suppose to be down wit so and so 
 You still the same lame from a year ago 
 I know you ain't raw 
 You ain't graduated with the gladiators 
 You're just practice for the young assassinators 
 Ey, you know you ain't raw. 
 Fuck The shit you tellin' them, I know he ain't shit as us 
 He ain't now competitor, That shit there ain't scarin' us 
 You bought yourself a slaughterin, a coffins what you headed for. 
 You didn't wanna die, well nigga what'd you pull a weapon for? 
 Just 'cause we the niggas all y'all ho bitches checkin' for 
 And ain't nobody real niggas would rather hear instead of us 
 Yeen out shinin us and yeen out selli us 
 Lot of niggas do it, don't nobody do as well as us 
 Hater wanna fuck wit us, let him get to vestin up 
 Hit 'em wit the chopper, chest and up, bet I wet ya up 
 Let ya partna get ya up, ain't nobody catchin up 
 But this some shit I'm down to receive a lethal injection for 
 King of the whole thing, Fuck whoever stepping up 
 Give a damn who is behind em, or care about who catchin up 
 Long as I'm alive, the second best you'll have to settle for 
 Come on now, you really think you better bro? 
 I got both friends blowin', on a boat just goin' 
 This bitch, his bitch, and yo bitch blowin' 
 Young pimpin' get dough in, like his last name Cohen 
 My fan base spread, and the shit kept growin' 
 And wat got me getting head in the vessel of the G4 again 
 Hook a hustle up wit investors and there he go again 
 20 million later and I'm guessin its finally soakin in 
 At best you just a hater who mad at me 'cause he broke again 
 Sellin all ya jewelry, considerin sellin dope again 
 'Cause he whos ballin outta control is suppose to be focusin 
 Wana be the king by default, they hopin for openings 
 Pray they see the day they hear me say I'll never flow again 
 But oh contrary I guarantee in one year 
 After another they'll suffer as long as I'm here 
 Fear no man alive, I don't care 
 You don't run shit nigga, be clear... 
 Ey, ey, you niggas ain't raw 
 I can see you niggas ain't raw 
 We can notice that you niggas ain't raw 
 I know you ain't raw.
