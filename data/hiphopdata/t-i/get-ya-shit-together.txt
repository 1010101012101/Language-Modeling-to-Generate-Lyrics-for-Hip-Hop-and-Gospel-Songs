(Talking) 
 As you can see the O.G.'s from Grand Hustle 
 Done laid it down again (T.I.P. shawty) 
 A man, this for all my homegirls that like to see a baller do his thing 
 (Get Ya shit Together... come on) 
 All the 8's, 9's, and dimes... I like to welcome y'all to the best time of ya life... ya understand that 
 All the stones are real and its chrome on all the wheels... ya know 
 Anything less is uncivilized 
 (T.I) 
 Aye, I pull up to the club, lift both doors up 
 Hopped out clean and ya hoes choose us 
 Walked in the door make the show hold up 
 Cause my neck and my bracelet was so froze up 
 The kind of stones bitches wanna see close up 
 So we don't approach them, they comin' and approach us (yeah) 
 Roll the dro up then go post up 
 Look down cause that's where it's gonna go, sho nuff 
 In the V.I.P. and all eyes on us 
 Hoes chill, poppin' pills, blowing dro no duff 
 Whatcha say you got a man, so what 
 I don'y know him, and baby he don't know her 
 I got a new phatom and my own chaffeur 
 Ya think ya finna be thinking 'bout him, no sir (haha) 
 Probably prefer to tell ya man goodnight 
 And she don't wanna know what the good life look like 
 (Chorus: Lil Kim) 
 If you ain't getting money goodnight 
 I know what a broke nigga look like 
 When you riding in your wheels, get ya shit together 
 Boy, then diamonds ain't real, get ya shit together 
 (T.I) 
 Now we can ball seven days, six nights 
 If that head and that pussy get right 
 And match ya panties with ya bras, get ya shit together 
 Come get your hair and nails done, get ya shit together 
 (T.I) 
 Hey, I'm off the scene with Louis the 13th 
 Chains swing to my jeans, and my T-shirt clean 
 In caee you been reasearching, I'm the King 
 With a style as mean as the earth seems 
 Chest on ice, and my wrist on gleam 
 30 karats in the ring, money ain't no thing 
 You think I'm playin', but I ain't joking 
 The dro king, if it ain't purple, I ain't smoking 
 Rubberband bank rolls, 50 thousand dollar cheddar knots 
 Try to shine, is you out your mind, boy you better not 
 I walk around with more money than you ever got 
 Shrewd attitude like I never had to sell a rock 
 Shawty I can get you in whatever spot 
 Backstage, front row, what I got to front for 
 I'm getting bored, don't even know what I stunt for 
 Got a lotta rides, what it hurts to cope one more 
 (T.I) 
 To all my hot girls, if you wanna come chill 
 Lets roll on chrome wheels, let me tell you what it is 
 We finna throw a little party at the crib 
 Where the floors tricked out and the rooms like iiillllll 
 The basements cool, but the pools unreal 
 Where that millionaire lives, shit remains concealled 
 So pop a pill, put on your blindfold 
 I'm hitting the dance floor, and grab eighty-nine more 
 Let'em know we on the way, where they been trying to go 
 I knew I had'em when they asked me "What kind of diamonds are those" 
 Headed to the spot, pouring double shots of XO 
 Play the "Love Below", ane watch'em undress slow 
 Flicks on the flat screen, make'em want to "get low" 
 And spit shine this dick of mine until it gets swole 
 When they kick it with the king, they don't wanna let go 
 So whatcha gonna tell a nigga, when he tells ya "Let's Go"
