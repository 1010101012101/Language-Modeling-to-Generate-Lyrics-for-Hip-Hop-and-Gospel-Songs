Verse 1 (T.I.) 
 Hey, when I think about all my time and all my struggles 
 Through all my grindin' and all my troubles 
 Man I came up from nothin', all I had was a hustle 
 With a blindfold tryin' to find pieces to the puzzle, no muzzle 
 I tell it like it is, that's that, right or wrong, I'mma call it how I see it 
 Don't forget that impossible is nothin', your environment's irrelevant 
 Just don't let your emotions overpower your intelligence 
 Refuse to give up, your mistakes don't define you 
 They don't dictate where you headin', they remind you 
 That time keeps tickin', let your mind keep clickin' 
 Never stop thinkin', be aware of your decisions 
 And beware of the collisions 
 And the potholes hidden in the road that you travel on your lifelong mission 
 Just listen everyday like a snap shot is taken, if you live you could learn to be great, be patient 
 Chorus (John Legend) 
 'Cause life is like a slide show 
 All the places I go 
 And all the things that I know 
 Through all the highs and lows 
 'Cause life is like a slide show 
 And all the things that I've seen 
 And all the things that I dream 
 You can't take away from me 
 'Cause life is like a slide show 
 Verse 2 (T.I.) 
 'Cause when I look back at a fly young cat 
 Who could rap with a dream, look where I took that 
 Beginning on bankhead, then I spread out 
 Vision in my head, all I had to do is get it out 
 When I walked out of my house, and look at my street 
 All I see is the opportunity that led me to truancy 
 I ain't really have a role model to enforce me 
 Uncle (someone?) they said next its gunna be you in it 
 As a juvenile count cases so fluently look at my life and learn from it, don't do it 
 If I only knew back then what I know now, how much better life it would have been if I had slowed down 
 Maybe I'd have been Kanye, instead of seeing gunplay 
 But god got a plan, I'll understand one day, 
 One day of life like a snap shot is taken, 
 If you believe you could make it, have faith, be patient 
 Chorus (John Legend) 
 'Cause life is like a slide show 
 And all the places I go 
 And all the things that I know 
 Through all the highs and lows 
 'Cause life is like a slide show 
 And all the things that I've seen 
 And all the things that I dream 
 You can't take away from me 
 'Cause life is like a slide show 
 Bridge (John Legend) 
 Looking back on my life time 
 See the slides go by, trying to wonder why 
 Looking back on where I've been 
 I remember when, you remember 
 Chorus (John Legend) 
 'Cause life is like a slide show 
 All the places I go 
 And all the things that I know 
 Through all the highs and lows 
 'Cause life is like a slide show 
 And all the things that I've seen 
 And all the things that I dream 
 You can't take away from me 
 'Cause life is like a slide show (3x) 
 I see, I dream, life is like a slide show
