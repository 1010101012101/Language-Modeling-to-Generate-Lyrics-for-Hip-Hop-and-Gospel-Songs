I got my hand on my damn cock 
 And I coped a gun so big it could probubly kill handcock 
 I ain't a rat, me talkin' to the damn cops 
 Is like lewis Fericon eatin hamhocks 
 Imma gorilla but I'm slicker than a damn fox 
 Been cool since pre-school playin' in the sand box 
 Imma hustla I used to hand tha gram na' 
 I can stand on the corner sellin gram after gram ha' 
 And no I'm not from Japan ha' 
 It just look like its asian in me/ 'cause I keep the hasian in me 
 I been in jail, I got a couple 100 dayz ^ n me 
 But I still keep the ak and the razor wit me 
 I ball hard so other ballers is afraid to stick me 
 'Cause if I get fouled ill probubly shoot the teck 
 And you can be the next nigga ill shoot to def 
 I wild-out, But if I foul out ill shoot the ref 
 I'm happy when I'm in the coupe' but the roof depressed 
 'Cause I always put them down the trunk is where I put them now 
 I got doe, ever since 0 put a pound in my hand 
 I been the man, you should put the crown on my dome 
 I'm on the phone havin' conference callz/ wit millionare "yeah" looked what I accomplished y'all 
 And I ain't tryna take a life I got a contience y'all 
 Plus the cops send you ^ north like the compass y'all 
 I was 17 living out in yanker y'all 
 Signed to RuffRiders wit a flow that was bonkers y'all 
 I can even lie, you can BMY, you can ask swiss too, SB and kiss too 
 You can ask DMX, the female Pitt 2/ and they'll let you know all the battles I had to get threw 
 You can ask dragon sheek about how I had to eat 
 Thousands of muff**kaz, YUP, man I had the streets 
 But ain't no money in battlin' 
 And I had to eat 
 I can spit reckless but I had to make a hit record 
 And now I make hit record after hit record/ And I make chicks get naked like this check it 
 I juss lick my lips on some LL shit 
 And make em' laugh on some david chappelle shit 
 And they be on some lets go to the hotel shit 
 And I give em' hard dick on some just got out of jail shit 
 The innocent man, been in the Can 
 And I neva made a statement never been on the stand 
 And it's all about the benjamins man... real talk 
 And you dude can't walk in my timbalands man 
 And m y sneaks don't fit you/ the streets don't fuck wit you 
 And I sip champain 
 And I throw back shots 
 And smoke pot the color of a Apple Jacks box 
 I rap but I sold crack rocks 
 And had the block jumpin' like the frogs on the honey smacks box 
 You digg em"...body bags!
