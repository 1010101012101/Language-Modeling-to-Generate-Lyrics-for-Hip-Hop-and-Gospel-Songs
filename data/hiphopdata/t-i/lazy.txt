[Hook: London Jae] (T.I.) 
 Know why you broke because you niggas is lazy 
 (Hold up tell em) 
 Don't wanna be a monster but this what they made me 
 (I am what I am, so?) 
 Start getting this money they thought I was crazy 
 (I'm out of my mind tell em) 
 I know why you broke you niggas is lazy 
 (Fuck nigga look) 
 Ain't got that problem damn that's fucked up problem 
 Going out bout these dollars hustle up stack these dollars 
 Waking up early going to go get it coming home go to sleep with it pray to God everyday let a young nigga ball 
 (But you niggas is lazy) 
 [Verse 1] (T.I.) 
 Tell me why every time I see you niggas you be all on instagram showing money off 
 Poppin' bottles at the strip club still living at yo momma house Nigga what the fuck you celebrating for? If you ain't got it what the fuck you on vacation for? 
 Make it seem like you ain't rushing tryna take it slow, you 29 nigga what the fuck you waiting for? Remain focused on yo grind keep it on yo mind 
 Universe can't deny you when you bonafide hey why you niggas taking pictures in your whip just acquire me some land it's a gold mine 
 Ain't no more waiting on niggas to put you on better get your hustle on get it going on your own boy and don't nobody give ah damn about your homeboy 
 Ain't no excuses for a broke boy no more 
 [Verse 2] (Tokyo Jetz) 
 Show me another bitch you know that grind like me on some new new 
 And old shit don't excite me 
 Don't wanna hear about no ems you flip birds cause niggas go get around a bitch and try to flip words 
 Give a fuck about what yo shoulda coulda woulda did 
 In the league ain't wit all that talking say that shit again 
 Catching plays serving jays just to go buy michael jays 
 Michael played you ain't gotta ride where michael play 
 Fucked up niggas loved to flex for the gram ain't got shit for a bitch and no I wouldn't give ah damn 
 You's ah butler at the trap you's ah doughman the type to flex with another nigga doughman, Bad like a bitch tell ah nigga no man 
 And take yo ass back to the 5th floor man 
 Fuck what you had at the moment you ah broke man you shouldn't have to tell ah nigga go man

 [Verse 3] (RaRa and London Jae) 
 Motherfuck the world and everything in it 
 Handle my business my business from start till I finish

 Freedom for it going over board catch ah charge if it's necessary 
 Hard on the legendary that's why you can't see me on TV 
 Hustle in 3D 
 Bitch I'm on point with it I pull up like the point with it one shot from the cannon leave these pussy niggas dead smoking like ah 
 Been had what it take to be these momma told me keep my grass cut cause you know these niggas shady go and get 'em baby 
 Staying ya lastest and stay in ya lane stay on the top stay out the business and roll with niggas and know the thing 
 Keep these niggas out your business they like hoes and shit keep God first keep on pushing and keep on rolling with it
