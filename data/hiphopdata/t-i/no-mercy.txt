The Dream: 
 There's No Mercy for me. 
 No crying myself to sleep. 
 No Mercy for me. 
 Nightmares have become my dreams. 
 No Mercy for me. 
 Good morning reality. 
 Will I wake? We'll never know. 
 I'm late for my date with destiny. 
 Let me go. 
 Let me go. 
 You've got to let me go. 
 Right or wrong. 
 Let me go. 
 I'm on my path. 
 Let me go. 
 (Verse 1: T.I.) 
 My mama loved me more than I do. 
 She said you pap was just like you. 
 Trapped in a vicious cycle. 
 Jesus youngest disciple. 
 Tell the judge if he throwed the book at me make it the bible. 
 Start callin' myself the king for lack of a better title. 
 Loyal beyond belief to my detriment. 
 It's so vital I change or blow opportunities like a choir recital. 
 Now while I do not care who tellin' meanwhile sellin' powder puts food in the bellies. 
 Well it's unfortunate. 
 The orphanage couldn't keep up the mortgages. 
 Kid go to school stupid they teachers ignorin' it. 
 Sort of just doomed, forced into bein' a goon, sell the kush in a jar. 
 Mix a guitar in a balloon. 
 Consumed with the same way of life I left. 
 Everything I know now learned by myself. 
 All you see are the whips. 
 The Maserati's Ferrari's. 
 So they don't sympathize. 
 Don't nobody feel sorry. 
 No Mercy.

 (Verse 2: T.I.) 
 Everybody's standin' and waitin' ?? they're hatin'. 
 Gospels say they should forgive me. 
 They'd rather hand me to Satan. 
 Blatant displays the day of hypocrisy. 
 Boy you got to be kiddin'. 
 Could it be possibly second comin' to Pac is me? 
 Remember that when he was here? 
 And when he died you realized you need him here. 
 God with me partner. 
 Ain't no one for me to fear. 
 Hindsight 20/20. 
 Future not as clear. 
 But I'm a rider till I die. 
 Put bullets 'tween my eye. 
 I just ask that I can make my peace with God and say goodbye. 
 Fuck up the world like lady Di hone the day he died. 
 His wife and sons and daughters know that every day he tried to be a person nah they wanted better verses. 
 They could market to the merchants. 
 But when they closed curtains, hey, you could be for certain ain't nobody perfect. 
 But when your rich, nobody gives a shit. 
 No Mercy.
