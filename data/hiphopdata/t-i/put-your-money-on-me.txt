This is not the time for hesitation 
 Leave it up to me and we will come for celebration 
 Ain't no need to fear 'cause I got this here 
 Victory my fan 
 I'm about to take you to the top now 
 Raises your glasses up you know this bottle is about to pop now 
 See I am no beginner, so if you're looking for a winner 
 Put your money on me, put it on me, put your money on me 
 Put your money on me, cause you gonna win [x2] 
 What you want me to roll? Seven? Eleven? 
 In a time started in a game, I'm gonna win it all 
 Give me the ball the game is on the line we, to have 
 Shake it baby, and watch it 
 Put your money on me, put it on me, put your money on me 
 Put your money on me, cause you gonna win [x2] 
 It's a bit weird you can bet the whole house 
 Pippin I will stay down, never sold out 
 Saying way I came in is the way I'm going out 
 All my own two, doing numbers in the 
 Shouting what you know about five [?] 
 A thousand say I better, drop my money 
 If you trust me with your, I make it better never worse 
 Let's be clear, listen girl, I'm here to help not hurt 
 Calibrate your shoes Gucci Louie, Jimmy Chius 
 Step your bag game up, 
 Out at Giuseppe Mall take a Valentino 
 Get the keys do your thangs 
 Say goodbye to the pain and say hello to the game 
 Yeah, thangs you used to hate about your life are about to change 
 I ain't a genie but I can your dreams come true 
 Tell the truth, and I can't 
 Put your money on me, put it on me, put your money on me 
 If you wanna win, if you wanna win 
 Put your money on me, cause you gonna win 
 Put your money on me, put it on me, put your money on me 
 I can win this, I can win this 
 Put your money on me, put it on me, put your money on me 
 Cause you gonna win, cause you gonna win.
