Gotta get your swagger together nigga 
 Get ya suits right, starch on the inside, ya dig? 
 You don't love yourself, you can't love nobody 
 Keep up nigga 
 You gon' need a travel agent to make these reservations 
 Ya man from Atlanta, way out in Cali 
 Catch me in New York, I'm on my way to Miami 
 I be in Hawaii, catch me in Pari 
 I be at home barely, I'll sleep when I'm buried 
 What I need some sleep fa?  this dough got me eager 
 I went to Japan, made a mil in a week, bra' 
 I visit king people when they see me in London or out in Ibiza 
 I didn't sleep for about three days 
 Maybe, see me in Haiti 
 With Wyclef Jean and a selection of ladies 
 My folk got that workin', like back in the 80's 
 See the money what move me, conversation don't phase me 
 Tell em why 
 'Cause I been around the world 
 Traveled the seven seas 
 I be poppin' bottles with celebrities 
 Find me flyin' high, smokin' better trees 
 Girls around the world 
 They keep calling me 
 (they call me) 
 Paparazzi they be following me 
 (They all be) 
 Hoping they can get a shot of me 
 It's my swag 
 They wonder what's so special about him? 
 Why I ain't selling records like him 
 (Tell 'em) 
 It's my swag 
 How he always looks so cool 
 When everyone do what he do? 
 (Tell 'em) 
 It's gotta be my swag 
 They wonder why he gotta were his hat like that 
 When girls see him why they act like that, hey 
 It's my swag 
 So what's the real reason niggas love him 
 Even though they girlfriends wanna fuck him? 
 (I guess) 
 It's gotta be my swag 
 Out in the snow, wearing my raincoat 
 See I'm getting wet and this bitch in the same boat 
 Came in the game slow, they act like they ain't know 
 I wasn't gonna leave, til I got what I came for 
 I still can't complain though, as long as I aim bro 
 Came a long way, but shawty ain't nothing change though 
 I still a in two though, don't get it confused, bro 
 Run up on me wrong, what you think I'm gon do, bro 
 Send you to ya maker, and go to Jamaica 
 Either to Cabo, I chill in my condo 
 My swagger is perfect, you know it ain't worth it 
 Guarantee ya boy the earth my turf if it hurts tell 'em why 
 'Cause I been around the world 
 Traveled the seven seas 
 I be poppin' bottles with celebrities 
 Find me flyin' high, smokin' better trees 
 Girls around the world 
 They keep calling me 
 (they call me)

 It's gotta be my swag 
 Regardless what the haters say, I'm as real as they come 
 I'm chasing that paper, baby, however it come 
 From singin' a song to moving ya by the ton 
 You never seen a nigga getting money so young 
 I been to the pin, all the way to Berlin 
 I've been to Switzerland skiing, pimp I'm goin again 
 Ain't nothing to catch me in the south of France 
 Caught a show smoking dro in Amsterdam 
 Ain't nothing to fly, all the way to Dubai 
 Same boy, St. Lucia everyday we can try 
 G5 to Moscow, now say I'm a lie 
 I'ma ball like a dog til the day that I die 
 Tell 'em why 
 'Cause I been around the world 
 Traveled the seven seas 
 I be poppin' bottles with celebrities 
 Find me flyin' high, smokin' better trees

 This is impeccable pimpin' 
 You couldn't duplicate this shit if I told you how to 
 Y'all niggas keep up 
 By the time you get to Puerto Rico my nigga, I'll be in Cuba 
 By the time you get to Cuba, I'll be in Haiti 
 By the time you get to Haiti, I'll be way over in Africa man 
 You know what I'm sayin' 
 South of France is my land, the earth is my turf
