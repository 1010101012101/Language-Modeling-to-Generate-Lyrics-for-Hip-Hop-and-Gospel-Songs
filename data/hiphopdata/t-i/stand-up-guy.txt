Ay, I know you done kicked it with a lot of niggas before 
 But ye ain't never kicked it with a nigga like me, though 
 (Hey, Hey) 
 I see ya baby, throw ya hands up high 
 If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy 
 Because the rocks gon' glisten and the drop's on 20's 
 Bend it over, let it drop if you wanna roll wit me 
 I say all my sexy ladies throw ya hands up high 
 If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy 
 Because it don't get better, niggas don't gett cheddar 
 Like that fella in the yellow Purple Label silk sweater 
 Bitch, stones keep glowin' on my wrist like whoa 
 And she can't stop lookin,' I know ya bitch like those 
 And she chose, ain't no question if the bitch might blow 
 Just get her to the crib, get her whole back sore 
 I'ma blow my dro, I'ma pop my pill 
 Ask anybody, "Wanna take a shot? I will" 
 Might see me in a different color drop hot wheel 
 With the top down low and the Glock concealed 
 I got mine high up, boostin,' racin' up the block, one mil 
 If the police try to chase me, you know they a done deal 
 I got skills, anybody wanna come test 
 Bet what's in this .45 be up in your chest 
 Yeah, I know ladies wanna kick it with a nigga so fresh 
 Who could spend 100k any day, no stress 
 The watch's insane, the chains is grotesque 
 Stay still if you wanna, like he ain't earn cash 
 I see ya baby, throw ya hands up high 
 If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy 
 Because the rocks gon' glisten and the drop's on 20's 
 Bend it over, let it drop if you wanna roll wit me 
 I say all my sexy ladies throw ya hands up high 
 If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy 
 Because it don't get better, niggas don't get cheddar 
 Like that fella in the yellow Purple Label silk sweater 
 If you got a man and you're tired of being there 
 And done gave him too many chances and tired of being fair 
 I offer you the opportunity to ride with a playa 
 You, me and a couple of freaks in the ride with a playa 
 Nevermind those outside when they stare 
 'Cause the chrome 24's on the ride give a glare 
 Because it's one guy and you decided to share 
 As long as you having the time of your life, who cares? 
 Man, we all sinners, what matters is in the center 
 I know God see my heart and I'm a stand up nigga 
 You can't beat me 'cause ye ain't man enough nigga 
 I look him in the eye and tell him, "Man up, nigga!" 
 You really getting money? Throw a grand up, nigga 
 Wanna fight? You should've hit me when you ran up, nigga 
 This Smith & Wesson hammer 'bout to slam, fuck niggas 
 Go and kick it with the hoes, throw ya hands up with 'em 
 I see ya baby, throw ya hands up high 
 If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy 
 Because the rocks gon' glisten and the drop's on 20's 
 Bend it over, let it drop if you wanna roll wit me 
 I say all my sexy ladies throw ya hands up high 
 If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy 
 Because it don't get better, niggas don't get cheddar 
 Like that fella in the yellow Purple Label silk sweater 
 Niggas ain't know me 'cause I live so special 
 Try to stay low key but I'm still so special 
 Flat screen's in the floor, quarter mil' in the dresser 
 Jewelry box glowing like a long lost treasure 
 I'm chillin' with Vanessa, met a girl named Heather 
 Told her "Hi, how ya doin'? Buy a drink? My pleasure" 
 Told her if she got a homegirl, go tell her 
 That I got a hard rug, I could go for whatever 
 She said that if Vanessa wanna touch it, just let her 
 She laughed out loud, shocked 'cause just met her 
 Bought the dro', get low, and its only one-fifth 
 And it's four pills left, do you wanna come with? 
 I see ya baby, throw ya hands up high 
 If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy 
 Because the rocks gon' glisten and the drop's on 20's 
 Bend it over, let it drop if you wanna roll wit me 
 I say all my sexy ladies throw ya hands up high 
 If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy 
 Because it don't get better, niggas don't get cheddar 
 Like that fella in the yellow Purple Label silk sweater
