What's happenin', man 
 It's T.I.P., you know 
 I'd like to dedicate this song to anyone who done ever lost somebody 
 To the grave, to the streets, or to the jail cell 
 I done been in situations when I had to cope with all three, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 I feel like the only thing I ain't done yet is die, you know 
 But it ain't how I live while I'm here 
 It's how I live when I leave, you dig? 
 Jamie Foxx: 
 Life's ups and downs, they come and go 
 T.I.: 
 But when I die, I hope I live in the sky 
 All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky 
 Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky 
 Jamie Foxx: 
 It's true, what goes around comes back, you know 
 T.I.: 
 So when I die, I hope I live in the sky 
 All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky 
 Tell God I wanna fly, let me live in the sky 
 My cousin Toot ain't have to die, right in front of his son 
 And his wife, he lost his life strugglin' over a gun 
 Give a damn what he done, it's my motherfuckin' fault 
 And I loved that nigga to death, no motherfuckin' joke 
 I can fell my eyes fillin', the Lord is my witness 
 If I catch 'im, I'ma kill 'im, I made it my business 
 Back in the day, you stayed in my business 
 Taught me I ain't have to incorporate yay in my business 
 Coincidentally, that's why today you're not with me 
 My cousin died over some yay and I miss him 
 Plus he had his family out, let's say she the eyewitness 
 But her boyfriend did the shootin', judge gave a light sentence 
 I heard that, now I'm dressed up in all black 
 Shot up the whole 'partments, and still ain't brought back 
 The best friend I had in Tremell, I lost that 
 Guess your death was a lesson in life, it taught me that 
 Jamie Foxx: 
 Life's ups and downs, they come and go 
 T.I.: 
 But when I die, I hope I live in the sky 
 All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky 
 Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky 
 Jamie Foxx: 
 It's true, what goes around comes back, you know 
 T.I.: 
 So when I die, I hope I live in the sky 
 All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky 
 Tell God I wanna fly, let me live in the sky 
 You ain't never seen a nigga ago to jail and sleep till day 2? 
 Well, that's how sick I was when J-Rue 
 Found out the hard way that was powder that they were tootin' 
 Overdosed on herion, died at 22 
 If ya ain't heard about your daughter, she smiles just like you 
 So cute, even resorts to violence like you 
 You know your baby mama loose, but ha, what can you do? 
 And I got for myself, yep, it's been a few 
 Now everything I do is for King, Messiah, Deyjah, Domani 
 Tell the Lord, they all I got, so please don't take them from me 
 From me standin' in the trap with Curran and Sir Cap 
 Laughin' at the niggas who serve with no strap 
 Tell 'em niggas, man, y'all trippin' with no maps 
 Get robbed and that's the part where my pistol ain't no help 
 Me, you, the crew just fell out over dough and a li'l crack 
 Never could apologize 'cause you died, that's why they say that 
 Jamie Foxx: 
 Life's ups and downs, they come and go 
 T.I.: 
 But when I die, I hope I live in the sky 
 All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky 
 Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky 
 Jamie Foxx: 
 It's true, what goes around comes back, you know 
 T.I.: 
 So when I die, I hope I live in the sky 
 All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky 
 Tell God I wanna fly, let me live in the sky 
 I bet you niggas think I'm livin' it up 
 Till you see polices laughin' as they pickin' me up 
 Went from seein' how many bitches I could fit in the truck 
 To three hots and a cot, is you kiddin' or what? 
 Fuck how many millions I got, nigga, so what if I'm hot 
 When I got prices on my head, feds rushin' my spot? 
 A million haters want me dead, forced to carry a gat 
 "But you is a seven time felon, what you doin' with that?" 
 It's a catch-22, either you lose or you lose 
 That's the way the game's structured, for real niggas to suffer 
 And I ain't never been a buster, always stood on my feet 
 Like a man, prepared to take whatever comin' for me 
 A pussy nigga or polices with a warrant for me 
 I'm a G prepared to die for what's important to me 
 Look anybody in the eye who say he want it from me 
 Put up the house and bet the odds if it's coming from me 
 O.G.'s say I need to learn to be patient 
 You tellin' me with these seven years of probation? 
 Pistol charges and a host of other open cases 
 If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facin' 
 I try to keep it to myself, but sometimes I couldn't it 
 Got four kids, the smiles on they faces 
 Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet 
 Take that away from me and my life is butt naked 
 Jamie Foxx: 
 Life's ups and downs, they come and go 
 T.I.: 
 But when I die, I hope I live in the sky 
 All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky 
 Pray to God when I die that I live in the sky 
 Jamie Foxx: 
 It's true, what goes around comes back, you know 
 T.I.: 
 So when I die, I hope I live in the sky 
 All my folk who ain't survive, may they live in the sky 
 Tell God I wanna fly, let me live in the sky 
 Ay, man, I'd like to dedicate this song to my cousin Toot 
 Alejandro Tremell Morgan, man, I miss the shit out you, my nigga 
 I'd also like to dedicate this to my homeboy J-Rue 
 Jamal Hendrix, what's happenin' 
 Also my partner Bankhead, (??), what it is, nigga 
 P$C for life and death 
 And my li'l homeboy Poncho, and my li'l homeboy Rico 
 I shed tears writin' this song, homeboy, that was real talk, man 
 Ay, I wanna live in the sky 
 Hey, let me live in the sky 
 Pray to God that I live in the sky
