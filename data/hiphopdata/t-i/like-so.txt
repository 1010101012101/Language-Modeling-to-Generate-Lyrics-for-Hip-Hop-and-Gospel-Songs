Ay suckas hate to see me get it like so, so 
 Bitches say they dig the way I kick it like so, so 
 Filthy rich and still I keep it pimping like so 
 Still the realest nigga in it with a image like so, so 
 Shawty just might pull up in a ride like so, so 
 With a bad bitch with him inside like so, like so 
 Super fly like so, niggas lying like "So?" 
 Still spit it how I live it on the Hill, here I go, go 
 Hey all I do is go and go by this and that to so-and-so 
 Lil' PeeWee say "They hate to see ya ballin' bro," you know I know 
 So what though? They can't stop it, they just watch it as this dough I blow 
 With millions in my pocket, shut it down in every store I go 
 Atlanta on my shoulders, oh I tow it like a soldier though 
 Suckers I expose or minimize in exposure so 
 They trying to make me kill 'em, I'm controlling my emotions though 
 Why you niggas lookin' so surprised? They not supposed to blow? 
 From trapping to the club scene, rapping to the big screen 
 Fashion, television, listen shawty doin' big things 
 Get team money, fuck a bitch if she ain't coming 
 So conceited ain't funny, if she ain't fly well she ain't for me 
 Pretty face, fat booty with a magazine stomach 
 Catch me somewhere where it's sunny, it ain't us if we ain't stunting 
 Say we running we ain't fronting, they be tripping, ain't nothing 
 If they kick it we be putting in, man I'm tryna teach you something man

 Is there a message from the greatest? Yeah, go get yourself some paper playa' 
 Try to do as I do, God but I anticipate you'd fail 
 It could be that my greasy yellow deuces make them hate me where 
 They try me bruh, they get tore up just like Drake did his ACL 
 Respected foreign and domestic in the A as well 
 Feel like 'Pac did when he said y'all act like y'all want me to stay in jail 
 I'm raisin hell today cause yeah I heard about you suckas 
 Use my absence as a present, so fuckin' ass time to suffer 
 Rappers keep on tryin' to catch-up (ketchup) but they just can't cut the mustard, huh? 
 I'm way ahead, gone stay ahead, so fuck if they say such-and-such 
 You keep the credit, what I need a trophy and a statue for? 
 Millions stackin' up and I don't give a fuck what awards show pass me up 
 My movie agent Brian always ask me what I'm rapping for 
 It's passion, I wouldn't trade it for all the diamonds out in Africa 
 Sahara hot, everything you dropping coming after us 
 My character is rare and for that reason they be starin', huh?
