(Feat. Hurricane G & Melanie Rutherford) 
 (Intro: Redman (Hurricane G)) 
 One, two, three, yoo! (yoo!) 
 (Verse 1: Redman (Hurricane G)) 
 Kick in the door, then I yell, "DON'T MOVE!" 
 C.O.'s is like, "yo, who the fuck is this dude?" 
 I give ya a little hint, it's the Soopamanluva 
 Took the shotgun from him, then I shot that fucker 
 Threw it to Hurricane, she like ("Yeah, let's do it!") 
 Snatched up a reporter that was here to interview her 
 Raised up one of his hands, put a bullet through it 
 Took off his Franck Muller, so Daily News know the time it took to rescue her 
 We goin' out the front door 
 Hurricane shotgun, hand lettin' the pump off 
 Bitches see it, and started wylin' in the mess hall 
 ("Fuck the Warden! We gon' get you muhfucka!") 
 Ayyo, told you I was comin' 
 (Verse 2: Hurricane G (Redman)) 
 Nigga, I ain't never scared 
 I ain't givin' no state time for shit I didn't did (WOO!) 
 Give me some more ammo, the front door's near 
 We two barrels smoke (with a hostage in here) 
 (Verse 3: Redman (Hurricane G)) 
 Yo G, you lock and LOAD? (Lock and load!) 
 Plan came together like the Eleven and Bellagio 
 We out the front door, Warden, shotty blow 
 I mash the gas till me and G is "adiós!" ("Adiós!") 
 That's how that Soopamanluva get down 
 (Yeah, that's how that bitch Hurricane get down) Get down 
 [Outro: Melanie Rutherford] + (Redman) 
 Oh, oh oh oh oh oh (Gilla House niggas) 
 Oh oh, (Yo Hurricane G! Glad to have you back girl!) 
 Oh (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah) 
 Oh, oh (Gilla Gilla Gilla Gilla)
