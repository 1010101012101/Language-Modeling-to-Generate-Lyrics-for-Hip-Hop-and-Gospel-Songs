 And you can brown those meat to the album, and 
 You was hot when your style was in 
 Now you're looking at killa 
 I wish I was down with them 
 No time to turn back 
 I keep my eyes focused 
 Slow like I'm on the i95 smoking 
 Like ocean, 12 when I'm posting, 
 Smell my zip lock when my red line open 
 Fat girls like yo that's my hero 
 Enough of them to pull a 5 5 0 
 Hand cocked Negro after the cream 
 I make your hood like watch time magazine 
 I mean, for bullshit my nose keen 
 And It only take one hit to get in those jeans 
 It's not yo ass, girl its yo green 
 And when I hit it, I keep the chicken lil man 
 Back on the train like, who the hell are you,

 Brick city niggas, yeah damn rider 
 Lalala, don't steal ma damn lighter 
 See I'm on point, never catch me slipping 
 Storch on the track watch how reggie rip it 
 Sniff it, you don't know it's on again

 On one wheel throwing it up like man MOVE

 Met her outside of the Copacabana 
 Far from a sucka, pull out the llama 
 And tell on myself like, yo well your honor
