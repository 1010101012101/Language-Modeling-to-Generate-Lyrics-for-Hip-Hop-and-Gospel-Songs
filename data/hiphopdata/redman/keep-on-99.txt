Intro: Dave Rockin' Reel 
 It's about 40 degrees out there 
 I know all you out there listenin to these sounds 
 Humpin and a bumpin out in your Jeeps 
 Well, ah... you tell 'em Moe (*fart sound*) 
 That's right, and right now, we're gonna hit you off 
 With one from Redman, and uh, it's about uh 
 Well... Ooh Ooh Ah Ah, he's gon', LET THE MONKEY OUT 
 (Redman) 
 Ha, Chi-Town in it 
 Yo, yo-y-yo-yo 
 Now first of all I be the Doc smokin' blocks of hash 
 Alert your fag ass commissioner when I harass because 
 Hood regulation is, no infiltration 
 If it's hot to your crew, then it's hot to the next patient 
 I'm in The Bricks like backspins on the mix 
 I'm not a playa, but y'all hatin' me like I'm a pimp 
 These cars y'all talk about, the Doc already whipped 
 You bout to go downtown bitch, like Tha Shiznit 
 Overseas bangin' cot in the parkin lot 
 I'm overdosin in a Amsterdam coffee shop 
 And when you lust for hardcore music to bust 
 Trust that nigga who bubble mo' than Alka-Seltzer Cold Plus 
 Static, niggaz actin' all dramatic 
 I'd rather smoke cabbage, in the chair gettin' tatted 
 My P.O. tried to violate me for the habit 
 Because I walked in the office rockin' straight karats
