Eminem: 
 No matter what people say 
 I'm gon' keep rappin' this way 
 No matter what you may think 
 I'm gon' keep doin' my thing 
 Eminem: 
 I'm almost as famous as fat bald men 
 Decided to write songs to teach Mouseketeers to sing 
 I stick 
 Britney Spears 
 in a room full of mirrors 
 So she gets fifty years of bad luck (crash) 
 Causing terror to 
 Christina Aguilera 
 When I grab her by the hair and drag her across the Sahara 
 Beware of this rap terrorist with a therapist 
 With a hair up his ass, like a rabbit crawled in his pants 
 Got a habit of holding Tylenol in his hands 
 Till it melts in his fuckin' palms and dissolves in his glands 
 (So who is it?) The fool who visit the playground 
 Wit' two biscuits to lay down the school district 
 Get pistol whipped wit a Mauseburg 
 Wit' a pistol grip and fed pitbull's shit 
 Sniff glue sticks, like I give two shits 
 If I get too rich, I just get sued 
 Redman: 
 Yo, I leave wit' no injure, after I blow four in ya 
 One handstand on top of yo' ninja 
 Crash it, (ERRRR) Doc stir the madness 
 Till y'all outta work like Tony Atlas 
 Walkin', cans in the laundry basket 
 America's most with the army after us 
 Fuck flossin', we take what's yours 
 A low fifteen like a ace in four 
 I'm outta work, but Doc laid them off 
 (Shit, the power's out) The tape is off 
 Yo, you targeted from arsonists 
 Papermate pens filled wit' arsenic 
 I got hoes that don't know what Prada is 
 Doc could shape up, touch your barber miss 
 Betty you wit a bloody blade 
 I turn rap camps into Crystal Lake 
 Fuck bitches face is what I'ma do 
 'Cause that what white boy Tano do 
 Eminem: 
 So how is everybody doin' tonight? 
 Hope you're in the mood to get drunk and scream in a fight 
 'Cause, uh, we gettin' down for the fuck of it 
 So suck my dick if y'all don't wanna bump to this 
 Off the wall 
 Redman: 
 Yo, so how is everybody feelin' tonight? 
 Hope you're in the mood to get rude and ill in a fight 
 'Cause, uh, we gettin' down for the fuck of it 
 So suck my dick if you don't wanna bump 
 Off the wall 
 Eminem: 
 No matter what people say 
 I'm gon' keep rappin' this way 
 No matter what you may think 
 I'm gon' keep doin' my thing 
 Redman: 
 Yo, you could buy Jaz spittin', hospital, son, admit it 
 Rip your lips off, kiss my ass wit' it 
 Slap bitches, got Marshall Mathers (printin') 
 Weed, X, and the acid tabs did it 
 I was happenin' wit' no rerun 
 Like Rob DeNiro when the heat come 
 My barrel hang out the Camaro 
 Aimed at the nose of them hoes it's hard to breathe from 
 Flash the gat, your town, bogardin' 
 Yo' wallet, your chain the main target 
 Beef is like cold engine, don't start it 
 Bust in the air and hit a airplane pilot 
 We clowned you, rap surround sounds around you 
 From 
 Tenspeed and Brown Shoe 
 Doc and Eminem, cock the M & M 
 Blood flows with 2Pacalypse and them 
 Eminem: 
 It's like, Funk Doctor meets the punk rocker 
 Got the drugs stopped inside the lunch box (uh) 
 Pop junk, like I just got jumped 
 Popped the trunk and pulled out the shotgun pump 
 Knock wood, it's all good, thank God for Vodka 
 'Cause wit' my luck, I'll probably get shot by a stalker 
 Probably got a fanatic waitin' upstairs in the attic 
 Wit' a automatic callin' me up there 
 My man Stan wit' a gat in his hand 
 Stakin' my house out in a tan tinted sedan 
 He pull your mouth out till you can't finish a damn 
 Ham sandwich, or your can spinach and Spam 
 Till you gotta sip through a straw, shoplift through the mall 
 Pictures of me on my mom's living room wall 
 Hey, ma, maybe I'll give you a call 
 Psych, you fuckin' bitch, suck a dick and two balls 
 I'm givin' you all my job descrip' 
 Which is, to piss bitches and priests off with this 
 Pop more pills than police officers 
 Arrive at the scene and pull me off of Kim 
 Teeth off my dick, hands off my balls 
 But y'all can kiss my ass, pants off and all 
 'Cause I'm so goddamn off the wall 
 I might as well as be a painting smashed on the floor 
 Redman: 
 So how is everybody feelin' tonight? 
 Hope you're in the mood to get rude and ill in a fight 
 'Cause, uh, we gettin' down for the fuck of it 
 So suck my dick if you don't wanna bump to this 
 Off the wall 
 Eminem: 
 So how's everybody doin' tonight? 
 Hope you're in the mood to get drunk and scream in a fight 
 'Casue, uh, we gettin' down for the fuck of it 
 So suck my dick if y'all don't wanna bump to this 
 Off the wall 
 Eminem: 
 No matter what people say 
 I'm gon' keep rappin' this way 
 No matter what you may think 
 I'm gon' keep doin' my thing 
 No matter what people say 
 I'm gon' keep doin' my thing 
 No matter, oh
