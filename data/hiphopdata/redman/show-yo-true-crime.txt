Yeah... You know what it is! 
 Ow! Killahouse! Uh! 
 Yo, the whole city's on my motherfuckin' back, y'all 
 I'ma snap, y'all 
 When I rack, y'all 
 The whole city's on my motherfuckin' back, y'all 
 From the Southside got to get to the North, y'all 
 Jump out with my shotgun, make you dead niggas drop (drop) 
 Niggas rock (rock), show yo true crime 
 (Sirens) 
 Yo, I pull up on the block 
 Cool it out, move it out 
 Chop it up, chew it out 
 Leftovers, threw it out 
 My CD in the streets, smell like a sewer out 
 Bricks put my music out 
 Shotgun, do it now! 
 Jump out with my shotgun, make you dead niggas drop (drop) 
 Niggas rock (rock), show yo true crime 
 (Sirens) 
 The new Redman CD is out 
 And not only bitches goin' wild; Niggas goin' wild too! 
 ...Bitches... Niggas... 
 ...Bitches... Niggas... 
 ...Bitches... Niggas... 
 ...Bitches... Niggas... 
 ...Bitches... Niggas... 
 Yeah... WKYA, Gillahouse Radio 
 We be kickin' yo' motherfuckin' ass 
 It's about 45Â° outside, but it's hot as a motherfucker in my car 
 'Cause I'm smokin' weed 
 Brick City is up in this bitch, and we smokin' weed 
 True Crime is definitely smokin' weed up in this motherfucker 
 And I'm out (And I'm out)
