So what I rock the tracks 
 That be weird like that 
 Even to this you couldn't catch 
 Me with photomat 
 My mack will leave you more cheeky 
 Than the japs D.O.A. 
 I'll make up like a big cat 
 Fill the raft 
 Of the shaft brother 
 Gettin' DAP like a little 
 From Brooklyn hangin' with 
 Nut crack like that 
 Tight nigger that a light ciggers 
 Blow sniffers * 
 Flow spitters 
 * You 
 Make sure you bring your phone witcha 
 Twist the situation 
 And make you hole hit ya 
 (Red man) 
 Rock rock on 
 Open you with the fumes of smoke 
 I left in the vocal booth 
 Disablin' plugs and microphone cablin' 
 Smoke filled automobiles I rode daily in 
 I * hooked the track till they blow 
 Shit for 30 G's 
 I ride blindfold 
 With bongos 
 Ha ha ha 
 Uh ah uh ah uh ah 
 So hit the road Jack 
 And don't you come back 
 Shit I wanna make the cheddar 
 Till I make bass collapse 
 Hit more holes than Minnesota Fats 
 You're brains been tapped 
 My superior aristocrat 
 Murder 16 bars 
 Drunk off o snaps 
 Pumped so many tracks 
 You might think I do crack 
 Rip the microphone like a hair wrestlin match 
 Lick your lips bitch 
 Cause your shit might eat chap 
 You know Nikki D. 
 These fake bitches be 
 Awsome bullshit *ing with the triple P 
 Demolish wax polish 
 This dick I got 
 Will make the baddest bitch topless 
 Jobless 
 * Around with it 
 Red litty 
 Shitty 
 Got niggers in Germany blitty 
 Now I'm the new president 
 And sellin spinach 
 50 cents and up 
 Can't handle get there * 
 Hu ha check check it out 
 Friggy, diggy, jiggy diggy 
 Check it out 
 Doctors in the house 
 Don't like what I'm sayin' 
 Got the nigger 
 * 
 Shit is bad, bad, bad, bad 
 The year 2000
