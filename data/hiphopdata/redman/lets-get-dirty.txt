Attention, all you niggaz, all you bitches 
 Time to put down the Cristal 
 Time to take off the ice for a minute 
 Time to throw a little mud in this motherfucker 
 Turn me up some, yo 
 Oh shit, who those motherfuckers comin' in here? 
 No, it can't be 
 Yo yo, gimme some room I'm throwin' elbows 
 Timberland boots, Air Force and shell-toes, who the fuck is them? 
 If I gotta pay to get in the club 
 I'ma go pop the trunk and turn the street volume up to ten 
 I ain't on the guest list, I ain't V.I.P. 
 I snuck in the exit, learned to D I P 
 My dress code is all black when I'm makin' the moves 
 Similar to the new Playstation 2 
 I can't help it if the club only packin' a G 
 And the fire marshal wanna shut it down in 3 
 And you ballin' ass niggaz, who's dressed to kill 
 For the hoes showin' the toes with extra heels 
 I gotta get in, I drove here 
 With a carload of bitches charged on Belvedere 
 My niggaz hit the cells if the line is thick 
 So I drive the 500, through the door of the bitch 
 Yo Red, wassup man? 
 Aiy they ain't tryin' to let you in the club 
 Yo, DJ Kool to the rescue 
 We gon' break this joint down 
 If you pumpin' this one in your truck, let's get dirty 
 Say let's get dirty, let's get dirty 
 If you really don't give a what? Let's get dirty 
 Say let's get dirty, let's get dirty 
 Everybody get your hands up, let's get dirty 
 Say let's get dirty, let's get dirty 
 If you ain't come to party shut up, let's get dirty 
 Say let's get dirty 
 Yo, security pattin' my legs and waist 
 But if I vacate the place, it'll be 
 All my niggaz in the huddle, on the count of three 
 We gonna bumrush The Tunnel, with a pound of weed 
 Cut the light on, you see it's Brick City in here 
 Blazin' like Biggie passed us a semi in here 
 Don't sleep, stay wide awoke 
 You dialed Doc, not dial-a-joke, crawl or you'll die in smoke 
 I keep it heated when the hawk is out 
 Seated low Tahoe, beat it when the dark is out 
 I'm outside of the line and I'm actin' a fool 
 Like a three o'clock bully, waitin' after school 
 Punk, I've been in this line for hours 
 I even killed the time by helpin' my man pass out fliers 
 Now all I wanna do is get in where I fit in 
 Shake my ass with the baddest pigeon with her wig in 
 Jump, move, crash, smoke, drink 
 Shake that ass stank, the fuck you think? 
 Poppa Bear at the table, and the porridge is pourin' 
 Since Def is the label, I belong in a morgue! 
 I'm walkin' half-dead, actin' senile 
 With bigga niggaz from jail than the one on "Green Mile" 
 I'll huff and puff, blow the club down 
 I'll snuff a duck, I'm headed Uptown 
 Yeah, that's right, we up in this joint now 
 Aiyyo, we gettin' ready to take over 
 Freddie, you grab the mic, I'ma grab the turntables 
 We gon' rock this joint baby 
 If you got up in the club free, let's get dirty 
 Say, let's get dirty, let's get dirty 
 And you drunk up in the V.I.P., let's get dirty 
 Say, let's get dirty, let's get dirty 
 If you swingin' from them club lights, let's get dirty 
 Say, let's get dirty, let's get dirty 
 And you like to start them club fights, let's get dirty 
 Say, let's get dirty 
 Everybody wave your hands now, let's get dirty 
 Say, let's get dirty, let's get dirty 
 Everybody jump up and down, let's get dirty 
 Say, let's get dirty, let's get dirty 
 Everybody come to wild out, let's get dirty 
 Say, let's get dirty, let's get dirty 
 If you a big dog no doubt, let's get dirty 
 Say, let's get dirty 
 Everybody wave your hands now, let's get dirty 
 Say, let's get dirty, let's get dirty 
 Everybody jump up and down, let's get dirty 
 Say, let's get dirty, let's get dirty 
 Everybody keep it goin' now, let's get dirty 
 Say, let's get dirty, let's get dirty 
 Just a little bit louder now, let's get dirty 
 Say, let's get dirty, c'mon, c'mon 
 Let's get dirty 
 Let's get dirty 
 Keep it goin' now 
 Let's get dirty 
 This is DJ, say what 
 On this motherfucker
