(Redman) 
 What you know about it? (4X) 
 A-what you know about it? 
 Yo... get it right from jump 
 Doc tapin on debate for months 
 I got zits on your face that can't wait to bump 
 Boogie Down to the point I barricade the Bronx 
 Papi spins the rhymes through your opti-lens, check it 
 It's five below, my brain is cold 
 Runny nose evey time Doc exchange a blow 
 My street team snipe the block up like Rob Lowe 
 Bodega liquor store, I'm dead in the window 
 PPP symbol got FBI on lookout 
 Strip the dirty clothes, hit a 118 cookout 
 I woof out, son you better buckle in 
 I write the madness, got ink foamin at the pen 
 I tear a ligament when I spit it in the wind 
 I got so much game I can Con Edison 
 Yeah chicken stand by for exposure 
 Shut your house down foreclosure ya in cold blood 
 (Yo 'cause) Shut the power out in your house 
 Cut the phone put a sock in your mouth, let da monkey out 
 Yo let da monkeys out 
 Show them fools what it's all about 
 Holla out, hear me out 
 Say, ooh ooh ah ah ah, yo yo (2X) 
 Yo let da monkeys out 
 Show them fools what it's all about 
 Holla out, hear me out 
 Say, ooh ooh ah ah ah, yo yo (2X)
