It's the Diggy Diggy Doc y'all, pumpin it yes y'all 
 D.O.C on the system, and we kickin it fresh y'all 
 Lettin the bass thump on and strong and hard for PPP 
 Engineerin the cut is E double E 
 Yo, it's the Diggy Diggy Doc y'all... 
 Yo, yo, yo when I hera a BASS! 
 This goes out to my niggaz and y'all bitches 
 The Benzes, Range Rovers, and sixty four switches 
 The C.I.A., Feds and even dogs sniffin 
 I plant a bomb right by the bar when it starts kickin 
 Doc stompin ground, Brick city hound WHAT? 
 Guerillas out the jungle get gritty now WHAT? 
 I'm walkin' barefooted over the loads of hot coal 
 Cuts from the snot nose keep your barbershop closed 
 When it goes, Flex don't have to drop the bomb on it 
 I keep my speech, bleek, and my right mind on it 
 So when it's my time, I'm heard in the streets 
 My mammal animal skin, excitin all the birds in your Jeep 
 I'm crazy nigga, when I was young 
 I spread and shaved both legs to my babysitter 
 Ran into BeBe's kids in a baby pickup 
 Shot up Toys R us and robbed Kay-Bee nigga 
 This is Def poetry far beyond my control 
 Fuck your teflon, be body armed like the toll 
 Unload from my Girbauds and make it hot for Homie 
 I puff so much of that green I Bleed guacomole 
 It's like Shaq and Kobe, I be for four quarters 
 Callin Veternarians to get the dogs off ya 
 "Animals Attack-Part four, people starin' 
 I'm not the type of fucker that'll go and meet your parents 
 I'm outside trick or treatin, fuck if my chick is cheatin' 
 I'm hungry as fuck, and I hope you niggaz sick of eatin 
 It's like the fourth letter, tenth letter, third letter 
 Chickenhawk bird getter, holla if you heard better 
 I got a chick with no ass a'tall 
 I fuck her for the love of that money, not basketball 
 And when my man comes home, and the Def Squad is back 
 Yo, gimme that rap game, we'll take charge of that
