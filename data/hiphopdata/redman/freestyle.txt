(From the end of the last track) 
 This is Funk Doctor Spot, K-Solo, comin' to ya' live 
 1996 to 97', Funkmaster Flex 
 (Redman talking) 
 I got tic tacs in my mouth with a big dick 
 But it don't matter, we representin, on some 
 Real shit, Def Squad, coming to ya live 
 Splittin these peas from a pod 
 Yo, K-Solo, drop 1 one time 
 (K-Solo) 
 A breaka breaka, one-nine, site 
 Get off the dappa-vine, guess who's back to shine? 
 (Redman) 
 I wish I won the lotterry 
 So I could tell niggas to suck dick out of animosity 
 And freeze em' like pottery, and give labotomies 
 To all you rap colonies, and shut your million dollar investment to economy 
 Impossibly, might be the one in black leather 
 Nametag sayin'
