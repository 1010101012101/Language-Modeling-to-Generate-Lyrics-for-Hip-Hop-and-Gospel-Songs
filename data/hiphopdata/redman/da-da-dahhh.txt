Yo, I gotta back ache, stomach ache, diahrea, vomiting 
 Cold feet, runny nose, head ache, insomnia 
 Cranky, moody, burpin' while I'm cursin' 
 Baby chair tied in a suburban drinkin' burban 
 I'm only 3, and gotta chip motorola 
 A hoochie babysitter with snitches by the stroller 
 Lyin', cryin, whinin', teasin' 
 Suckin' tities like I had years of breast feedin' 
 In the beginning I was sinning 
 Kept my mama back and forth 
 To the hospital for the constant kickin' 
 Kept them ass whippin', I'm gettin' them all 
 Show off like Fodolo so fuck all y'all 
 Do you get your ass whipped with your mom's bad luck 
 Like AHUH YEU YEU get hit by a truck 
 Playin' catch a girl, fuck a girl 
 Throw her in a sandwich 
 Just a young boy doing grown man shit 
 I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit 
 I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit 
 Like kickin' your ass 
 I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit 
 Smokin' weed 
 I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit 
 All day check it out 
 I'm only 13 puttin' in work 
 Rockin' Chinese shoes with high top converse but first 
 We was all gas watchin' game of def with Bruce 
 Walkin' home from the movies (* Red makes karate movie noises *) 
 I thought about the sex often 
 I even kept a heartland for them white girls on magic garden 
 Light skin, chubby and shit 
 Ran my mama's phone bill for callin' Biggs Biggs Biggs 
 The old hands used to make them little niggaz fight 
 The lead patch was the shit if you snatch it right 
 And everybody knew the pattern of pac man 
 Rams was 15 and that then was happenin' 
 Niggaz used to get robbed at twin city 
 I was cuttin' on SL's glue with a penny 
 When EPMD dropped It's My Thing 
 I said damn I gotta get up in this rap game 
 I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit 
 I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit 
 Like touchin' your tities 
 I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit 
 I'm just a young boy doing grown man shit 
 Like Stealin' my mama's car 
 I used to tell my Sis I'm gonna make it bitch 
 So close to gettin' on I could taste the shit 
 In a hot ass room cuttin' smooth operator 
 In my last year at West Side High I barley made it 
 Flippin eightballs, going to Montclair State 
 I passed one class and still owe their ass cake 
 For quick cash, Doc hit up 13th ave 
 Sell white boys oregano dash then we laughed 
 That was the days now the times switched up 
 Son either walk them dogs, sunff it or get snuffed 
 Them ho's got triflin' but much thicker 
 My weed got better so easily I fucked shit up 
 I test y'all with my def squad cam 
 And I don't stage show dive unless y'all amp 
 To all my fans, arivaderchi to ya 
 And any ho that didn't blow Doc, I NEVER KNEW YA! 
 Now I'm a grown man doing grown man's shit 
 Now I'm a grown man doing grown man's shit 
 Like still sqeezin' your titties 
 I'm just a grown man doing grown man shit 
 With a big ass car 
 Now I'm a grown man doing grown man's shit 
 Rollin' better credit 
 Now I'm a grown man doing grown man's shit 
 Yo yo shit is crazy 
 Now I'm a grown man doing grown man's shit 
 Like smackin' your ass 
 Now I'm a grown man doing grown man's shit 
 Like shaving my beard 
 Now I'm a grown man doing grown man's shit 
 I got hair on my chest!
