Yo, yo, yo, nigga 
 Swinging through the forests of the jungles 
 Yo, c'mon, c'mon, yo yo, yo 
 Yo, look around your seats 
 Do you see anybody weirder than me? Me 
 When you find him then I try him, fry him like the gorilla 
 Billy Hanas to Hebrew, how to be an MC 
 Shit, take two tokes, I'm dope riding over notes 
 Overload your periscope, Doc da most 
 Lock and load with the rock 'n' roll star, dozed off 
 I had him bruised and closed off with one phone call 
 Chickens, mida mida the heater, believe-a I'm a dog 
 Straight Labrador chedda retriever 
 Let the gorillas out, 'til the blood is spilling out 
 Put a slug up in his mouth, then the thug is chicken out 
 Darkrooms get ignited, bright lights on the mic 
 So when we battle they can via satellite it 
 PPP draft pick is massive, athlete Tenactin' flow 
 Doc captain up battin', Brick City Mashin' 
 Turn it up, smoke that shit up 
 Take money money, Brick City Mashin' 
 Stolen cars, counterfeit bills 
 Freak that shit out, Brick City Mashin' 
 Two for fives, push that shit out 
 Let the monkey out nigga, Brick City Mashin' 
 Freak that bitch out, smoke that weed out 
 Freak that hoe out, Brick City Mashin' 
 Say I am, I am, somebody, somebody 
 Say I am, I am, somebody, somebody 
 I'm from Da Bricks where the weed go 
 For two for five dick, you try this 
 I promise I'll be at your video, smackin' the shit out of you 
 From crew to hairstylists 
 Guerrilla maneuver on an intruder 
 I pack like Sindbad pack the house in Aruba 
 Blow your brains, yeah, leave the murder scene 
 Lookin' for me is like lookin' for Herb at Burger King 
 'I Get Around' like 2Pac and Shock G 
 Fuckin' hotties, block the block like Monopoly 
 I rock with an eighty-watt spitter, block lit up 
 Snatch profit up, get your Benz lock it up 
 So which nigga got a dope enough spot? 
 Call X to shut 'em down and I'll open up shop 
 PPP draft pick is massive, athlete Tenactin' flow 
 Doc captain up battin', Brick City Mashin' 
 Turn it up, smoke that shit up 
 Take money money, Brick City Mashin' 
 Stolen cars, counterfeit bills 
 Freak that shit out, Brick City Mashin' 
 Two for fives, push that shit out 
 Let the monkey out nigga, Brick City Mashin' 
 Freak that bitch out, turn that bitch out 
 Turn it up, Brick City Mashin'
