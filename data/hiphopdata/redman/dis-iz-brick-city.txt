This is WKYA Radio, you motherfuckers 
 We got our next caller on the air, bitch, you on the line 
 Yo, this is Big Tracy and I don't give a fuck, nigga 
 Give me some of that shit straight out of The Brick City 
 (Brick City) 
 For my nigga, Guts 
 We was thinkin' about you on this one, Guts 
 Hold your head up, baby 
 We got you on this one 
 For everybody from the block 
 Everybody from the crews 
 You know who you are, no newcomers 
 (Let 'em know, son, let 'em know, son) 
 This is how we do it, baby, open up on 'em, go ahead 
 (Let 'em know) 
 Yo, when I DIP, I'm VIP 
 I'm Doctor, I rush niggas to emergency 
 Open heart, filled with darts, 99 Agents 
 Know they Get Smart when I throw it in park 
 Pop the trunk, sellin' CD's $15's for chumps 
 'Cause I'm like Noah's Ark from the slums 
 Holla' at cha frog, I'm getting them Bud 
 Like them frogs on the log, I'm balls to the wall 
 When I do anything, nothing's hard 
 I make it easy and talk greasy to broads 
 Gilla, say my name 5 times in the mirror 
 I'm jumpin' out, whoa 
 You can hear the 
 Sounds of the motherfuckin' men 
 Tryin' to get your chain, tryin' to get your chain 
 Flush this down the drain 
 I'm the new raw on the streets 
 You can get 10 years per each song 
 Catch a contact, what I write from the arm 
 Now little white kids bring pipes to the prom 
 I was supposed to quit 
 Be an influence 
 But, the weed is like Nike 
 I just do it 
 I'm ET zooted, way out there 
 You got weed? Then roll with the Sonny and Cher 
 Suffering succotash, I leave you suckers sufferin' 
 Huffin', puffin', at last 
 This is Brick City, hear the gunshots 
 Where they hate cops, on every block there's a weed spot 
 This is Brick City, hear the gun jam 
 If you don't run family with a suntan 
 This is Brick City, hear the gun spit 
 Niggas jump ship when we spit, 'cause we run shit 
 Play pussy wit' us and get fucked quick 
 Who got the duchess? 
 Yo, I keep the ghetto in me, I love the sweet taste of revenge 
 I'm focused, my soul's been cleansed 
 Now I know who the enemy and who the friend 
 But still, with my eyes closed they both blend 
 I'm not a follower, I start the trend 
 Y'all can follow that dummy, I'mma follow this money 
 Now I'm at the age, where I need to get paid 
 If a nickel bag gets sold in the park, hey 
 Did I stutter? I got the guns and butter 
 My craftwork be movin' the numbers 
 I keep a Roscoe like Kurupt brother 
 Hang out my window, blaow, what up, fucker? 
 Violence sells, but I ain't a violent male 
 But if you violate, I'll play the violin well 
 From Bricks to Park Hill 
 Don't be like Zoolander waitin' for that Blue Steel 
 To be shown on your grill 
 This is Brick City, hear the gunshots 
 Where they hate cops, on every block there's a weed spot 
 This is Brick City, hear the gun jam 
 If you don't run family with a suntan 
 This is Brick City, hear the gun spit 
 Niggas jump ship when we spit, 'cause we run shit 
 Play pussy wit' us and get fucked quick 
 Who got the duchess? 
 Yo, right here, yeah 
 The Gilla House niggas in the motherfuckin buildin?, mayne 
 Goddamn, nigga, big nuts uptown, 512 what it is mayne? 
 WKYA, Gilla House radio
