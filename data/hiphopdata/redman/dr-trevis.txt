 (Dr. Trevis) 
 OK Redman, on the count of three I want you to 
 Completely forget how you did the first album 
 Erase data number four exhibit C-Y protanium 
 Now... what I want you to do is concentrate 
 Concentrate on how you will do the second album 
 No funk element too nucleus to the ninth power 
 Exhibit four-L-W 
 Now... when I count to three 
 I want you to fall into a deep mind of emotion 
 But before you do Redman, I want you to 
 Light this shit up high! 
 (Redman) 
 *Somebody whimpers* 
 Tired of burning, ah! 
 *Whispered* Kill that motherfucker 
 Yeah, help me get out of here 
 *Whispered voice cackles* Die nigga die! 
 I don't wanna die 
 *Whispered voice* Die! Hehehehehe 
 (Dr. Trevis) 
 I want you to concentrate very hard on how you will do the second album 
 I want you to take the funk where it has never gone 
 I want you to take this LP to where no other LP has risen 
 You son of a bitch! 
 Dr. Trevis signing off 
 (Redman) *beginning of Bobyahed2dis music* 
 Ah... 
 You are now about to enter the psychotic mind of Redman 
 Let's take a journey on a funk cosmic adventure 
 To where no other nigga or bitch has ever entered 
 Let me lick your funky emotions with my cosmic lyrics 
 From a place we call hell, and beyond...
