(Redman) 
 I'm rollin' in my ride, my eyes real chinky 
 Hit 145, bout like 12 twinkies 
 Today a good day, I know don't jinx it 
 I will keep a smith, just like J Pinkett 
 Baby without blinking, I do it my way 
 I shit on folks, the opposite of arcade 
 I'm rude pardon me, I'm too hood doc 
 On your mind all the time, like? 
 Who am I 
 That nigga to fly 
 My mama gave birth on Continental Airlines 
 I ain't lyin' 
 I'm back boy, you hit the backboard 
 I'm all swish make a memo on your blackboard 
 This class here nigga is for the underground 
 UGK, Doc and Meth locking the summer down 
 And I ain't playin' games homie, so get it right 
 'Cause I get Toed up under city lights, I I get Toed up under city lights 
 (Method Man) 
 Yo, I dropped in 95, now I'm on 95 
 South in the dirty been ridin' dirty since dirty died 
 I guess you dirty my nigga, heard me I'm certified 
 And when I ride I'm wit Reggie Noble, New Jersey drive 
 I make it happen homie, I take you back when I was wearing Pony's 
 And the older niggas be snapping on me 
 How many rapper know me? I know a cash on 
 Face is the game I take it, and Holy matrimony 
 And now can't nothing hold me, I foss with UGK 
 Some dudes are more like Kobe, I'm more like? 
 You either in it pimpin'or you just in the way 
 I love this life that I'm livin', your shit can end today 
 Two things to know about me, I guess I never change 
 And keep this money like Southern Cali, it never rain 
 See, I ain't playin' games wit ya, so get it right 
 And I get Toed up under city lights, I I get Toed up up on the city lights 
 (Bun B) 
 Yeah, UGK 4 Life 
 R.I.P. to da Pimp 
 For the king of the trill is up in this bitch 
 Drop the top and I hit the switch 
 You see my leather seats tuck and stitch 
 Texas niggas, we getting rich 
 Fuck a hater man, fuck a snitch 
 G code nigga we don't love the po po 
 No more swag man, pass the do do 
 We keep it super tight like? 
 I'm bout my Doe hoe so don't play wit my bread man 
 I been tryin' to stop the violence nowadays so instead 
 I'm popin' a truck and grabbing that chopper wit an AK to your head 
 I'd rather be laying up in the bed wit you baby and making head 
 Yeah, my Cadillac cold candy painted dripping like burning dick 
 Mt steerlin' wheel is wood grain I grip it and turn it quick 
 I'm riding 4s both black and yellow stripes like a Steeler 
 And as far as rims go, I'm a 84 wheeler 
 A slab peller when I mash out in the cadi lean 
 And back up on leather man I'm smoking on a fatty 
 It's UGK 4 Life if you ain't know you'd better get it right 
 (Why?) I get Toed up under city lights, I I get ? up on the city lights
