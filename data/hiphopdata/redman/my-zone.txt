 Yo yo yo 
 Funk Doc is on a world tear jumpin' 15,000 feet 
 Out of plane in the air like where 
 The next ghetto I'm gonna run 
 I'm gonna shut them ear drums until you talkin' sign language 
 There go son! 
 Walls start to bleedin when my jaws is leakin' 
 Doc do 200 first week your label call a meeting 
 Yeah I'm gonna let the gorillas up in your building 
 Kick your door, shoot up the ceiling 
 Snatch the coke, kidnap the children 
 Don't start lying about your tire being flat 
 Or catching a allergy attack 
 I'll axe the battle and the bat 
 Saddling them ho's like yeehaw! 
 Bitch enjoy the tour when you're fuckin' 
 The Doc 5 O'clock free ride 
 Ambulance too late for them 
 These paper thin niggas robbin' at the ATM with a staple gun 
 Aqua Boogie scuba diver, holla 
 You rap scholars do the knowledge 
 You wont make it through to college 
 B the R I-C-K 
 Never wore those, My lyrics to the mic 
 Is like my hormones to pornos 
 Bitches keep the door closed 
 Mothafuckers be tryin' to step in my zone 
 I grab my chrome 
 And I'm like yo its on (4x) 
 (Verse Two] [Shooga Bear) 
 Ayo who fuckin' with us? 
 We bustin' yo gut with lyrics 
 You either feel it or fear it 
 And smash the hardest artist regardless his steez 
 I'm heartless with these (you ready) cock it and squeeze 
 With precise precision you better listen 
 Guaranteed to blow your vision if we engage in collision 
 Talk slick and be laid out in chalk 
 I still stay out in Newark 
 And blaze my way out the court 
 So nigga fuck what you thought
