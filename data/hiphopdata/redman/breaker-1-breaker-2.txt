(Intro/hook) 
 A breaker 1, a breaker 2 
 (Repeat x 7) 
 (Erick sermon) 
 I be the don up in this motherfuckin (ha ha) 
 I puts it down, I rock 'scapes 
 I roll bounce to the ounce (die-I!) 
 I bring dat physical front (aha) 
 Believe it I function the paraplegic 
 So teach it like if he was playin' backgammon 
 A new sheriff in town and not reggie hammond 
 I pack a cannon .38 snuff nose 
 Not for shootin use it for executin 
 Lames out there callin my name 
 For fame, change ya plan punk refrain 
 This tune leaves ya whole crew stuck or stupid 
 Dumb and dumber all this summer 
 A newcomer, yeah I take 'em to check out the avenue 
 Me and my crew went through 
 Wooh!ah-ah!word is born!word is born! 
 (Redman) 
 I said "come on!"(come on!),"come on!"(come on!) 
 We's the posse pair so some niggas can get done on 
 I'm not the one to funnel, I'm lyrically inclined 
 Seriously devine, whatever we g is crime 
 Ha!I take it down, make it clear and in your bare lair 
 Leaving critical as sang elsewhere 
 You want to get jig-dafied-what it all means 
 For such, I tote glocks in akarl jeans 
 For all means necer-ssary, my blood vessels 
 Turns to .38 specials and cause wind pressures 
 I be blowin' like I'm mr.cool, the invincible 
 Keepin' my court trials municipal 
 The principal my next class will teach you how to roll blunts 
 Pick up (ah!), buda and mex tags 
 Fifty the less, mo' vex, the soviets 
 Another co-nnect on my rolodex 
 I met my smokin' vex, I keep my lyrics smack-daddo 
 Cash in your chips then proceed to blast metal 
 Next up I believe that's keith 
 Why don't ya get on the mic and rock the symphony 
 (Keith murray) 
 Well it's the 16-bar slaughterer, telepathical brain murderer 
 Comin' with the sh-t you never heard 
 Ask yourself the very same question 
 Which crew is fuckingg with this squad in this profession 
 Your mic's in my possession, I crush you with aggression 
 An' I ain't talkin' for niggas that learn a lesson 
 So why should I sit around and let this fake fuck pass my eye 
 Fake niggas fuckingg up my eye 
 Filthy with nasty it's the slog for the job 
 Forget any clan said "who squad the mob?" 
 Tired of beat-down, shot up and robbed 
 Niggas askin why, it's my motherfuckin job 
 How many ways can I say "I just don't give a fuck!" 
 Runnin' niggas over in every truck 
 But my motto is "fuck!get the bottle!pass the bottle!" 
 Bad luck had ya stuck, uh 
 I crash ya brain and smash ya spine 
 Yeah another hard one to find
