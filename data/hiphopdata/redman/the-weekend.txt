(Intro: Erick Sermon) 
 Def Squad 
 Yo real 
 Let's make it happen 
 I hear voices saying that's Erick Sermon 
 (Verse 1: Erick Sermon) 
 I'm in the 500, sitting on twenties 
 Pumping Junior M.A.F.I.A., and B.I.G. getting money 
 I'm Hollywood swinging 
 It feels good sometimes so I zoned out and freak the funk and start singing 
 No Diggity, if it ain't def it ain't shit 
 I'm like kerosene I keep the place lit 
 Yo will fix the beat up 
 No beef read put the heat up 
 Yo Dave you the man now speak up 
 (Verse 2: Dave Hollister) 
 Friday, 5 o'clock time to close shop 
 Bounce through the hood, she was moving on the block 
 Cause my peeps already blowing up the box 
 With the 411 on the party hot spot 
 Hit the rest shake the 9 to 5 stress 
 Till about 10 and it's time to get dressed 
 Gonna be a whole lot of woo-ha! 
 Know how we do on and on 
 Till the early morn 
 Always want to kick it not now I got move on 
 Beats pumping gotta get my groove on 
 Everybody's on the floor getting down 
 Players on the wild trying to spread the mack around 
 Red alert cause the bar's on fire 
 Serving drinks faster than you can blink an eye 
 Ain't gotta worry bout working next day 
 The weekend's here and it's time to play 
 (Chorus: Dave Hollister) 
 This is how we roll on the weekend 
 Friday, Saturday, Sunday, this is how we roll 
 This is how we roll on the weekend [Repeat: x2] 
 Verse 3: Dave Hollister] 
 Saturday, bounce back upon the set 
 Shorties rolling deep looking right 
 Reminding me of the f I just swung her last night 
 Oh my god shining, talking on the phone 
 Check out baby in the beamer on the cell phone 
 Gotta put my thing down 
 Lock down the next round knock down for the next round 
 There's a run for the full-court press 
 Up and down bringing on the opposition stress 
 But it's all love this is how we do 
 Till the next Saturday keep it all true 
 Next stop speed down to the mall 
 Gotta get prop for the night the next player's ball 
 Same time different place 
 Parlay on Sunday for the weekend 
 I drop it right here 
 Reggie! 
 (Verse 4: Redman) 
 My persona strictly don't be caring like I'm Donna 
 The Jerse bomber, go 10 rounds with anaconda 
 I blow the 9 x to order me some pussy 
 The Bernie Mack'll get the party bumping like burdussy 
 Yo, yo I'm fucking your audio 
 Hardcore reservoir material video 
 And when you arguing me and my Dave Hollister and E walking 
 While the valet parking shit
