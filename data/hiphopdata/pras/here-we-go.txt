(Chorus : Khadejia and Product) 
 The boys look so good but they're minds are not ready 
 So here we go y'all 
 That's why Id rather talk to a man cause his mind is so steady 
 So here we go y'all 
 Yo, the girl looks so good but her mind is not ready 
 So here we go y'all 
 That's why Id rather talk to a woman cause her mind is so steady 
 So here we go y'all 
 (Khadejia) 
 Friday night, see I'm vibin and feelin' right 
 Sunroof back me and my baby just had a fight 
 I gotta clear my mind of problems that I have inside 
 So I bump in my ride so you don't hear me cry 
 (Product) 
 Uh, the weekends here and I'm chillin' with my crew 
 You got me stressed and I'm sittin' here sippin boo 
 (Khadejia) 
 I wanna clear my mind of problems that I have inside 
 (Product) 
 Oh, when I jump in my ride I'm a try to loopb hold it all inside 
 (Wyclef and Pras) 
 Yo Yo Yo we don't like-a 
 A jealousy with envy 
 We don't like 
 When you smile and wanna blast me 
 We don't like 
 Stick up, give up your jewelry 
 We don't like 
 Suicide for milly or for dealy 
 What we like 
 Yeah is when we chill wit the herb 
 What we like 
 Is to drink in the Titanic wit no iceberg 
 What we like-a 
 Is when the thugs get hyper 
 Make sure what your brinme ain't carrying lice 
 Right about now if you ready for the ghetto princess Khadejia 
 Let me see one finger in the air 
 Da da da (one finger in the air) 
 Da da da da daaah (one finger in the air) 
 Da da da (one finger in the air) 
 Da da da da daaah (one finger in the air) 
 Da da da daah (one finger in the air) 
 Daaah 
 Hey yo Khadejia Khadejia
