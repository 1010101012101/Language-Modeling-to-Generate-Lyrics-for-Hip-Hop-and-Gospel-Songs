Who is the man with the master plan? 
 A nigga with a motherfucking gun 
 44 reason come to mind 
 Why you motherfucking brothers' hard to find 
 He be walking on the streets and fucking with mine 
 Stupid punk can't fuck with a mastermind 
 See I never take a step on a Compton block 
 Or LA without the AK ready to pop 
 'Cause them punk motherfuckers in black and white 
 Ain't the only motherfuckers I gots to fight 
 I thinks it's better to be retelling the facts than cuffed up 
 And jacked and fucked up 
 What you niggas looking at? You going 
 Goddamn! 'cause it's the city 
 And for you to survive a nigga gotta be a gangsta 
 And I'm a nigga you can't remove 
 Took out a lot of motherfuckers for trying to prove 
 To their homies that they can hang by dealing with me 
 But once again in the end they D-E-A-D 
 I never did time on a murder yet 
 'Cause I relax and back, do a job and jet 
 Yo I know you understand my flow 
 So here we go with Death Row 
 Come let a motherfucker know 
 D-are-E 
 A motherfucker who's known for carryin gats 
 And kick raps that make snaps 
 Adapts to anything violent that I'm located at 
 If you see me on the solo moves best believe that I'm strapped 
 4-4, .tre-8 or AK-47 
 'Cause slowly but surely send you on a stairway to heaven 
 Just put my finger on the trigger and pull back 
 And lay a punk motherfucker flat 
 As he wonder what popped before he got popped 
 I told you I was Dre and you know it don't stop 
 Now I know you understand my flow 
 So here we go with Death Row 
 Come let a motherfucker know 
 I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off yeah 
 I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off yeah 
 I breaks 'em off but I ain't speaking about between the thighs 
 I'm talking about cocking a gauge in between your eyes 
 That'll make you drop to your knees 'cause you realize 
 That a gat will make any nigga civilized 
 Old buster ass nigga talking bullshit 
 Don't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with 
 Get lit or hit up by the doctor 
 A nigga that breaks 'em off properly 
 Real G so doubt it 
 I'm the one who's doing it while these other niggas talk about it 
 And if motherfuckers come at me wrong 
 I straight put my .44 Desert Eagle to his motherfucking dome 
 And show him why they call me the notorious one 
 The name's Dre Eastwood when I'm packing a gun 
 You don't believe me, well step up and give it a try 
 And if you die youse a buster 'cause real niggas don't die 
 But some still don't hear me though 
 You're too near me not to hear me, nigga yo 
 So now you know
