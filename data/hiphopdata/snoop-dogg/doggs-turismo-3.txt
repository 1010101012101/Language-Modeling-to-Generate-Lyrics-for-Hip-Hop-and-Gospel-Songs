 Foot to the pedal and the pedal to the floor 
 Hurry up and take off, adjust my seat 
 Everything cool 'cause I'm dippin to this beat 
 Slideing slippin' smashin' off 
 I take the lead while others crash the wall 
 Doggy D-O-double G in the motherf***ing Gran Turismo 3 
 The coolest game doin' things, 
 I'm picking up speed while I'm switching lanes 
 Doin' 'bout a 100 tring to reach 2 
 My homie in the baby, baby blue 
 Yah so, sittin' on firestone, 
 I'm trying to bring another checkerd flag home

 When you in last place but look I'm in 1st place 
 So how I'm gonna trip of that 
 'Cause if I lose I'm gon turn it off and get right back 
 Chose a whole nother car 
 A whole new course 
 With tunnels and trees 
 Thanks for your support

 Picking you up when your downing

 Knocking all across your face

 In a whole nother place, in a whole nother state 
 I was last seen doing 298 in a s2000 silver and black 
 Sitting on crome lookin' bad like that 
 Burning rubber smashing like that 
 On the real deal 
 Live from aplicot hill

 Shit that's way to cute 
 Slipping out my lane 
 Swerving trough the grass 
 Man these cars be on my ass 
 Bumper jumper to 300 way cool

 Should I stop or should I role 
 My mission is to possision my pawssesion 
 And fold these others up 
 Even my brothers (what?)
