It's the cold game 
 I ain't been one 
 Jumping in and out of the range 
 Maybe an old school... 
 Spinning the vision from each I paint 
 You got to do it you can 
 Gotta keep rhyming 
 East Side high you are doing life/right 
 ... Blowing in the wind 
 You are thinking of me 
 It's gangster Bliss 
 This is what you're calling a sis 
 Pass the morphine quick 
 Memories is miss 
 I made a lot of friends 
 A whole lot of money 
 Been down a couple times 
 But it never stopped my rhyming 
 In fact I got better 
 ... Turn it to rapper 
 A world shows in Dumfries... 
 This is how a player roll 
 And I will never be questioned 
 By some new young... 
 Snoopy D made the way for you to walk 
 O in to the Almighty 
 Without you it couldn't be doing... 
 And I will never be crucified 
 Within my own zone 
 Here is a very good reason to show love 
 But you gotta separate... from... 
 Going down for murder in 93 
 The... all over the city bowling a... 
 I changed I got smarter 
 I got a daughter 
 Two sons beautiful wife a... 
 I did it all Jack 
 Popping this... international using overseas yeah 
 Don't judge me you only knew Snoopy 
 You never tried to know... you tried to groove me 
 Like some loco I earned my respect 
 ... I should get a cheque 
 But all alone I did it B 
 Cool as a blind with a C 
 Leveled my life as I push away the goopy 
 But in the... you can call me up a Snoopy 
 Don't worry about your circumstances 
 Take your chances 
 Still from the L B C 
 You are the C 
 Haler at your own for Snoopy 
 I paid my duce and now it's time to make a change 
 Gotta make that move 
 There is a time and place for everything 
 (Repeats) 
 Don't worry about your circumstances 
 Take your chances 
 Still from the L B C 
 You are the C 
 Haler at your own for Snoopy
