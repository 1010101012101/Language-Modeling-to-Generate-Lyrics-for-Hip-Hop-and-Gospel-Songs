 Ya, uh 
 I was once told 
 You get your freedom 
 By letting your enemy know that 
 You'll do anything to get your freedom 
 Then you'll get it 
 It's the only way you'll get it 
 When you get that kind of attitude 
 They'll label you as a crazy negro 
 Or they just call you a crazy nicca 
 They don't say negro 
 Or they'll call you an extremist 
 Or a subversive 
 Or a setatus 
 Or a red or radical 
 But when you stay radical long enough 
 And get enough people to like you 
 You'll get your freedom 
 So don't rum around here 
 Tryin' to make friends 
 With somebody whos deprivin' 
 You of your rights 
 Their not your friends 
 NO... they ya enemys 
 And treat them like that 
 And fight them 
 And you'll get your freedom 
 And after you get your freedom 
 Your enemy will respect you, and will respect you 
 And I say that with no hate 
 'Cause I don't have no hate in me 
 I have no hate at all 
 So I say to you, Big Man 
 I'm the man you think you are 
 If you want to know what ill do 
 Figure out what you'll do 
 And ill do the same 
 Only more of it NICCA 
 (Damn... shit) 
 Oh it ain't over muthafuccaz
