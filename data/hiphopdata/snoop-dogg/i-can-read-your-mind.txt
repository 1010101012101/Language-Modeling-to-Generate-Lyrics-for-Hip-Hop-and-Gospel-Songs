I've been waiting to tell you this 
 You are, all that a man could ever want 
 Listen 
 I stepped in a club in your hood 
 I slowly turned left and there you stood 
 You and your friends talkin' 
 But then our eyes connect and moved in 
 It was just like 2-ways on a beam 
 I'm your king, be my queen 
 What did you want to do tonight? 
 My truck is parked out front, so let's ride 
 I can read your mind, babe 
 (Oh) 
 I know what you're thinkin' 
 (I know what you're thinkin', baby) 
 It's all right with me, baby 
 It's all right, yes 
 I can read your mind, babe 
 (I can) 
 I know what you're thinkin' 
 (I know what you're thinkin', baby) 
 It's all right with me, yeah) 
 It's all right, yes 
 So baby take a ride with me 
 And I'll fulfill all your fantasies 
 And when the rain starts pourin' down 
 Then all the love that's lost will be found 
 I'll make your mind loose control 
 Over your body that's my goal 
 So baby just come down here 
 Just let the gravity pull you near 
 I can read your mind, babe 
 (I can) 
 I know what you're thinkin' 
 (I know what you're thinkin') 
 It's all right 
 (Can you feel me, yeah?) 
 It's all right, yes 
 I can read your mind, babe 
 (Just me and you right now) 
 I know what you're thinkin' 
 (I got an idea babe) 
 It's all right 
 (Oh, yeah) 
 It's all right, yes 
 I know you wanna rub 
 (Rub) 
 I know you wanna touch 
 (Touch) 
 I know you wanna feel 
 (Feel) 
 So baby keep it real 
 I know you wanna see 
 (See) 
 I know you wanna be 
 (Be) 
 In my B-E-D 
 Grindin' slowly 
 I know you wanna rub 
 (Rub) 
 I know you wanna touch 
 (Touch) 
 I know you wanna feel 
 (Feel) 
 So baby keep it real 
 I know you wanna see 
 (See) 
 I know you wanna be 
 (Be) 
 In my B E D 
 Grindin' slowly 
 I can read your mind, babe 
 (I can read it) 
 I know what you're thinkin' 
 (And I know) 
 It's all right 
 (You see, I know, you know, 'cause I can feel it too) 
 It's all right, yes 
 I can read your mind, babe 
 (Just me and you, yeah) 
 I know what you're thinkin' 
 (I know, yeah) 
 It's all right 
 (Oh, yeah) 
 It's all right, yes 
 I wanna love baby 
 (That's what I wanna do to you) 
 I wanna feel you 
 (If you come, if you come) 
 I wanna love baby 
 (Oh, yeah) 
 I wanna feel you 
 (I wanna feel you, girl) 
 I wanna love baby 
 (Come on and go with me) 
 I wanna feel you 
 (I want you to stay with me)
