(Feat. The Dramatics and Lil' Half Dead) 
 Like a star slipping out of place 
 Sliding from the sky 
 Tumbling through space 
 When you touch my hand 
 I swear I feel like I'm ballin' 
 (Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin') 
 Yeah ballin' 
 (Ballin', Ballin', Ballin', Ballin') 
 Like a wheel 
 Whirling round and round 
 Rolling down a hill (rollin' down a hill) 
 Spinning on the ground (rollin' down a hill) 
 Your kissing makes me dizzy yeah 
 In the head (ooh yeah) 
 And I'm ballin' 
 I'm ballin' 
 Hmm, I love this game 'cause this game love me back 
 I'm pushing a lac, smoking sacs like a mad mac 
 Bringing me back, banging the 8-track track 
 The Dramatics and Battle Cat and Snoop like that 
 Big stars in big cars we pull up at the big clubs and sit at the big bars 
 Sippin' champaign with a bowl of cavier 
 Hell yeah you are, yeah you are 
 Say it say it, 'cause they all deny it 
 Player play it, 'cause you can't deny it 
 As fly as it get, as fly as I spit you know it's the shit 
 It's so gangsta, gangsta bitch 
 Switch back to the old school, old fools know 
 This here thang we do so original 
 I got to have it, lavish 
 Is how we establish 
 On the real love one it feels good to have 
 Like a rose, flippin down the street 
 Looking oh so sweet (lookin' oh so sweet) 
 Bumpin to the beat (bumpin to the beat) 
 These streets they keep me busy yeah 
 Makin' bread 
 And I'm ballin'

 Working for myself

 'Cause they know

 And all round the world, my nigga, it's the same song 
 And when its time for your callin', fallin', wit no stallin'

 Just rollin' tru his town 
 Stacking dollar bills (stacking dollar bills) 
 Raising dogg pound (he be raising the dog pound)
