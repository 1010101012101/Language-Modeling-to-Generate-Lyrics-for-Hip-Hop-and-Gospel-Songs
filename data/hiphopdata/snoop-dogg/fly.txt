Only one queen of a hip-hop so 
 Love and write, let's do it 
 Yeah, welcome to the church volume two 
 Exclusive two one three 
 Brand new Snoop Dogg Nate Dogg word g 
 Chorus: (Nate Dogg) 
 Ridin' in my car 
 And I'm listening to the radio 
 I'm listening to a sad girl sing 
 Sang about how she got her heart broke 
 People reachin' for stars 
 I just won't be somethin' that you wrote 
 When you're alone it gets mighty cold 
 Don't act as if you did not know 
 She let me play with her heart 
 I'm working late 
 I said I'd soon be home 
 All the while the girl was home alone 
 Let me tell you what she cryin' for 
 (Why) 'Cause I'm fly yeah you super fly Nate dogg 
 Oooooowwwaaooooo I'm fly yeah 
 (Yeah you super fly but me I'm super duper and I'm super duper fly) 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 I'll be the great at this 
 I know you waited this 
 And I wanted this 
 To be alaberate and so stringuis 
 Then you just slide by 
 And we say you want another kisza 
 Is that the way you gone for his eeh? 
 I know you feelin' all hurt inside 
 But won't you talk to a playa 
 Let me help out your pride 
 I'm like the countsla, a pasta, a pretcher or phycologist 
 A sherk on a freak 
 P my technique 
 I where mink skater boots 
 And I'm the rit leg is scaloo 
 And I ain't afraid to shoe 
 And I love to two two 
 Feet deep as I slide up the street 
 I'm from the LBC 
 And I don't know what y'all been heard about me 
 But I'm a c-r-i-p with some p-i-m-p too 
 I'm a real pimp playa from the two one three crew 
 Now look here fool if you gon bang or hang with the dog 
 You best to get in 
 Holla at er Nate Dogg 
 (W) 
 Three piece wit her mate in me 
 Gotta think my s*i* stinks 
 Stacie Adams wit a drink 
 Pocket paddles they come from brink 
 So what, the ladies wink 
 You the one in mercedes, shot gun with the thang 
 Cold chiller watchin' the lion king 
 Cryin' and thangs 
 'Cause I'm with Snoop and Nate 
 Singin' rymin' and thangs 
 I'm out late 'cause I'm ground of the change 
 I ain't wit dime for games 
 Cock back and I'm tryin' to aim 
 At everythang that be hatin' my fame 
 So stregulatin been lacin' the game 
 Ain't no mistake in the game 
 To one mother f-in thrizzle 
 Shippin on the sizzle 
 And that's for shizzle 
 Fo times for the riddle 
 You know these bahrs 
 Every where we go, you know who us are 
 You could tell by the car 
 Sampain, Caviare 
 Bubble bath, I say I love you and I laugh
