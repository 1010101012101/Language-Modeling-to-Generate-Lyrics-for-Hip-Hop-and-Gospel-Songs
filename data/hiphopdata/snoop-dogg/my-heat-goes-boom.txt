Another day another dolla for the top dogg with the gold flea colla 
 Nigga make the whole dogg world wanna holla 
 The way they do my life and I'm steady tryin' to do more right 
 So trife your life could disappear 
 And if you ain't careful who you fuckin' wit nigga 
 Now reappear come here come near so you can hear what I spit 
 So sick and tired of niggaz standin on that "G" shit 
 And just because you on starz wit some khakis 
 And think your rap style can out rap me and now jack me 
 Come here nigga slap yo self 
 That's probably why yo shit still sittin' on the motherfuckin shelf 
 And mine sold out ever since it came out 
 Blue carpet roll out, #1 no doubt, mo' clout, down south, mixin' it up 
 With dem niggaz that don't never hesitate to bust 
 What you niggaz tappin' on my front door for? 
 Hmm oh you lookin' for yo hoe? (you heard) 
 We in the hotel room doin' the zoom 
 And let me let you know nigga my heat goes boom 
 And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom 
 And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom 
 I'm back on the scene, chopping green 
 Captain on the team, call me commissioner nigga 
 So just listen up look like you bored and our boy's bridges 
 He hangin' wit dem niggaz but dem niggaz straight bitches 
 Left a nigga hangin' at the club when it was scrap time 
 Then a week later gave him a shot on in a rap line 
 Now they in a New York rap time 
 Rapper turned snitch now you livin' on a main line 
 Money's too tight to mention but let me mention 
 When dem niggaz in da kitchen find out he's snitchin' 
 They gon' get him and when his homies find out he's snitchin 
 9 times out of 10 dat nigga gon be bitchin 
 (You know what) you know what transformin' is switchin' 
 And oh yeah informin is snitchin 
 But I ain't one to tell you ain't heard from me 
 I'm just an MC tryin' to stay super free 
 And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom 
 And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom 
 And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom 
 And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom 
 Look here fool I know this game in and out 
 And quit tryin' to tell me bout dem niggaz down south 
 Don't try slide wit that west side love shit 
 That dove shit eat a dick bitch 
 I can can read you from the giddy 
 I read you I took you to my home and I fed you 
 And led you upstairs upstairs to a room with 37 niggaz 
 That was strapped up hatin' waitin' on you nigga you the victim 
 We don't don't pick 'em we just stick 'em and when once we get 'em we got 'em 
 We try to rid the streets of creeps and freaks 
 Like you for all y'all snitches and bitches 
 We gonna do the world a big favor 
 'Cause niggaz like y'all be fuckin' up the gangsta flavor 
 And oh yeah it ain't no west coast thang 
 'Cause niggaz out of town got birds that sing 
 And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom 
 And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom 
 And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom 
 And my heat goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
