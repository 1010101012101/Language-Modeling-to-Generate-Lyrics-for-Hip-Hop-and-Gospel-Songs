Yeah, gotta say what's up to my nigga Slick Rick 
 For those who don't like it, eat a dick 
 But for those who with me, sing that shit 
 As it go a little something like this 
 La Di Da Di, we likes to party 
 We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody 
 We're, just some niggaz who're on the mic 
 And when we rock up on the mic we rock the mic [right] 
 For all my Doggs keepin' y'all in health 
 Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself 
 'Cause it's cool when ya cause a cozy conditionin 
 Which we create, 'cause that's our mission 
 So listen close, to what we say 
 Because this types of shit happens every-day 
 I woke up around 10 o'clock in the mornin 
 I gave myself a strech up, a mornin yawn and 
 Went to the bathroom to wash up 
 I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup 
 And said um "Mirror mirror, on, the wall 
 Who is the top Dogg of them all?" 
 There was a rubble dubble, five minutes it lasted 
 The mirror said, "You are you conceited bastard" 
 Well that's true, that's why we never have no beef 
 So I slipped off my khakis and my gold leaf 
 Used Oil of Olay, 'cause my skin gets pale 
 And then I got the file, for my fingernails 
 I'm true to the style on my behalf 
 I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath 
 Clean, dry, was my body and hair 
 I threw on my brand new Doggy underwear 
 For all the bitches I might take home 
 I got the Johnson baby powder and Cool Water cologne 
 Now I'm fresh, dressed, like a million bucks 
 Threw on my white sox, with my all blue chucks 
 Stepped out the house, stopped short, oh no 
 I went back in, I forgot my indo 
 Then I dilly [dally] I ran through an [alley] 
 I bumped into this smoker named [Sally] from the [Valley] 
 This was a girl playin' hard to get 
 So I said "What's wrong?" 'cause she looked upset 
 She said um
