3 piece wit a mink 
 Gotta think my shit's staying stacy Adams 
 Wit a Jay Crockett pad on dey cuff 
 On brinks 
 So wut da ladies wink'in 
 You da one in the mercedes 
 Shotgun wit dem things 
 Couch chillin' watchin da lion king 
 Crying and thangs 
 'Cause I'm wit snoop and nate 
 Singing rhyming and things 
 I'm out late 'cause I'm rhyming for change 
 I ain't wit dimes for thangs 
 Hop back and I'm trying ta aim 
 At everythang, dat be hating my fame 
 Just regulatin been lacing da game 
 Ain't no mistake in da game 
 2 one mother f'er dwizzle sippin on da sizzle 
 And dat's fo' sizzle 
 Fo times for da riddles 
 You we is bar 
 Everywhere we go you noe who us are 
 You could tell by da car 
 Champagne caviar 
 Bubble bath 
 I say I love you 
 And I laugh
