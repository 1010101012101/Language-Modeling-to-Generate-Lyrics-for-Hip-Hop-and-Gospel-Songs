 Yeah... Top Dogg... uh... 
 Get your money whip your hair 
 Executive branch blowin' smoke like a player 
 Yeah in the club, yes it cracks 
 Cute little mama, but they stacked with bags. 
 I'm smokin' Grape Purple Urkel 
 You in Doggie world come and join my circle 
 I break down herbal till I move like a turtle 
 My money is green and my Porsche is turbo 
 (Boom!) 
 In hot pursuit, come rock with Snoop 
 Baby's a lawyer, her body's the truth. 
 I'm in the game for real, it pays to chill 
 I walk in the club and they front the bill 
 I'm the Big Dogg, best beware 
 You comin' with me, if you stop, they'll stare 
 Should be on my team, in my car 
 On the way to the spot, Yes you are 
 Toastin' up, postin' up 
 And when we done, we West Coastin' love.

 On the VIP tip, Maserati's in the lot. 
 Chillin' with the stars where the bottles never stop 
 Got a model on my lap, Baby show me what you got 
 (Boom!) 
 With a cup of Landy, Tiffany and Sandy 
 Girls who like girls, wanna do it to Daddy 
 Real talk, the suites is next 
 One more drink gonna lead to sex 
 These girls is bad, the floor is packed 
 They shut the door down when they reach the max. 
 Whatchoo tryin' to drink? Clear or yak 
 She got a apple bottom, homie, all I do is mack 
 I does it well your game is whack

 Smoke good with T-pain, and Snoop, the weed doctor 
 Big 808 now feel the bass in ya chakra 
 And watch me smoke like a shotta 
 Coke bottle shape light green eyes 
 Drunk off of love like a colt 45 
 I keep kush in my lungs 
 I'mma smoke till I die 
 Just bust a bad one from my homie D-Dimes 
 (Boom!) 
 They do it for fortune, some for fame 
 I've got five different strains, 
 You ever taste Purple Rain? 
 Turn up the volume, adjust the gain 
 Ain't a damn thing changed, still a G-Thang 
 Lil Momma whip you hair, exhale the chronic 
 As the smoke disappears, I'm ready to ball 
 Your girl on my team, is she ready to fall 
 And if you didn't know, I'm the big Snoop Dogg. 
 (Boom!)
