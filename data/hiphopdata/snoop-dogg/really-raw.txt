Tyga 
 Uh, in this world after one thing 
 Get ya money man, like ya uncle told me 
 Haven't slept since, cause my dreams real big 
 I ain't even rich yet, so get up off my d-ck bitch 
 Oh shit haters through the mist, on some g-shit 
 Low clip, pop gun, hot toast, noodle shit 
 You a little noodle drip, watch a shark eat the fish 
 Ever seen piranha, it's like the movie jaws again 
 Leave a n-gga barbershop, chop his top, head gone 
 Too fly, three strong, nick name, gold bones 
 What the f-ck you boys want 
 Roll on you like a joint 
 Talk behind a n-gga back but muthaf-cka don't you point 
 Pharrell 
 KFC by the bucket, that's really raw 
 AK's you can't tuck it, that's really raw 
 Watching porno's on the iPad, that's really raw 
 Lamourghini's with the wide baggage, really raw 
 Tyga 
 It's that raw from the crippers, pyru's and strippers 
 Homie, you could tip her, but I already get her 
 Harder than I did her, same sh-t, get no different 
 Ain't no fun if the homies can't hit it 
 Bitches, ice cold heart make you shiver 
 I got the flow, make summer turn winter 
 Ch-ch-chilly raw cheese stick made up in Philly 
 I come in peace like a hippy 
 Piece on my chain, grandma say that silly 
 The new sports car, retard, Timmy 
 Watching porno's on the ipad, illy 
 Tryna follow my style, don't get dizzy muthaf-cka what you know 'bout 
 Pharrell 
 Jerseys with the stealers, that's really raw 
 20 n-ggas on four wheelers, that's really raw 
 Going green, that's so cool, that's really raw 
 My jacket smell like jet fuel, it's killing y'all 
 Snoop 
 Just bought a '77 baby blue cadillac 
 Run it down, set it off, let it off, get back 
 Diss this twist, this is one of my flavas 
 Guerilla's, lions and tigers, they all of my neighbours 
 Swinging from a vine, like step in my limelight 
 My kids and my wife and my life got my mind right 
 Now, what do you do when they spray with the AK 
 Retaliate n-gga cause ya life full of melee 
 We got the heat for the street, let me that dough 
 Ya boy talkin' like we don't know 
 Blast pass with the forks, no you rollin' with the locusts 
 Been the pimpest and the hippest and I've always been the dopest 
 Peep my style 
 Pharrell 
 Louie bags you can't order, that's really raw 
 Miami cribs on blue water, that's really raw 
 Blood making the game redder, that's really raw 
 N-gga we hot like Mayweather, it's killin' y'all 
 P stand for Pacqiauo n-gga 
 The Game 
 California nas 
 I'm more raw than red snapper in the pacific ocean 
 More raw than the brick as soon as you split it open 
 Talkin', the kitchen smokin', 
 Talkin' the pots bubbling 
 I got the blueberry on deck but not muffins 
 My glock stuffed in my Levi's 
 My levis on the buttersoft leather, (2012) 
 Panamera four door Porsche 
 My chick named Porsche 
 They two in the same, my stick game is torcher 
 Monday night raw, got n-ggas in figure four locks 
 Hit the block YO, you would think it was Fort locks 
 I don't rap for Billboard spots 
 I just wanna f-ck as many bitches as I can and cop some more drops, raw 
 Pharrell 
 Gargling with champagne, that's really raw 
 Classic millionaire frames, that's really raw 
 White tee's and Jordan 3?s, that's really raw 
 Windmilling with them shits on, killin' y'all 
 N-gga, raw
