Convict 
 Music 
 And you know we a front 
 I see you windin' 'n' grindin' up on the floor 
 I know you see me lookin' at you, and you already know 
 I wanna love you, love you; you already know 
 I wanna love you, love you; you already know 
 Money in the air as Mo feel grab you by your coat tail 
 Take you to the motel ho sale 
 Don't tell, won't tell 
 Baby said I don't talk dog, but she told on me, oh well 
 Take a picture wit' me 
 What the flick gon' do 
 Baby, stick to me and I'm a stick on you 
 If you pick me then I'm a pick on you 
 D-o-double G, and I'm here to put this dick on you 
 I'm stuck on p****, n' yours is right 
 Rip-ridin' them poles, and them doors is tight 
 And I'm a get me a shot for the end of the night 'cause p**** is p**** 
 And, baby, p**** for life 
 Shorty, I can see you ain't lonely 
 Handful of n****s, n' they all got cheese 
 So you lookin' at me; now what's it gonna be? 
 Just another tease far as I can see 
 Tryin' get you up out this club if it means spendin' a couple dubs 
 Throwin' bout thirty stacks in the back 
 Make it rain like that 'cause I'm far from a scrub 
 You know my pedigree, ex-deala, use to move 'phetamines 
 Girl, I spend money like it don't mean nothin', 
 N' besides I got a thing for you 
 Mobbin' through club in low-pressin' 
 I'm sittin' in the back in the smokers section (just smokin') 
 Bird's eye, I got a clear view 
 You can't see me, but I can see you (Baby, I see you) 
 It's cool; we jet, the mood is set 
 Your p**** is wet 
 You rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck 
 Your body is movin', you humpin' 'n' jumpin' 
 Your titties is bouncin' 
 You smilin', n' grinin', n' lookin' at me 
 Girl, n' while you're looking at me, I'm ready to hit the caddy 
 Right up on the patio, move the patty to the caddy 
 Baby, you got a phatty, the type I like to marry 
 Wantin' to just give you everythin' 'n' that's kinda scary 
 'Cause I'm lovin' the way you shake your ass 
 Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass 
 Normally don't get caught up too fast, but I got a thing for you 
 Girl
