[Snoop] yeah man, this shit here gonna be bigger than the o.j. case 
 [Tray deee] what? 
 [Snoop] his dick 
 *Laughter* 
 [Tray deee] another blast from the long beach section 
 Break gangsta shit (wake up) 
 I thought these fools knew 
 Verse 1: tray deee 
 Out on the scout I'm about my papers 
 'Cause ain't nobody doin' deee no favors 
 I'm tryin' ta get major with minor risk 
 Maximisin the minimum of time is spent 
 On the heist, nice and easy believe me 
 I take mine and make mine extra cheesy 
 Keepin' niggas in a headlock 
 Undress em, press 'em down in a full nelson 
 I hit jacks off six packs of the crooked one 
 They slip and I'm bookin em 
 Fuck fingerprints, gimme from their fingertips 
 Chips to the neckline 'cause I got a tek9 
 Check mine like a pimp-main ho 
 So hope you only see me when my grip ain't low 
 I go up in ya like a skeleton 
 So s-n-double o-please let 'em know the crew I'm bailin with 
 Chorus: snoop doggy dogg 
 East-side lbc 
 Is what I claim but my game is dpg 
 And every hustler in my clique got to get his grip 
 And in my world a girl is considered a biiiiiitch 
 Is money all that makes you move? 
 You ain't doin' what'cha s'posed to so you gots ta prove 
 Somethin' to the ones you love but you needs ta know 
 If you ain't doin' it for yourself it don't matter d'ooh! 
 It was a wake up, wake up, wake up... 
 Just to wake up, wake up, wake up... 
 Wake up, wake up wake up... 
 Get up, get up, get up... 
 Verse 2: tray deee 
 I break fools off like lepresy 
 If they dare, you stare when they next to me 
 I'ma threat to whoever sweat my style 
 Hard gangsta aim to represent till death 
 Reality, you battle me you be in the dirt quick 
 I'm clever with whatever type of weapon I work with 
 The bare hand man sleeper 
 I even banked up and shank motherfuckers in the *? penta? * 
 I sanked a gang of tough fools in my time 
 So try me you're liable to lose on my line 
 The 44'll be what cracks ya head 
 'Cause that's exactly what I'm bout ta cap you with 
 I figured niggas gettin' soft like jellatine 
 So doggy dogg tell 'em all who we're sailin wit 
 Chorus: snoop dogg 
 East-side lbc 
 Is what I claim but my game is dpg 
 And every hustler in my clique got to get his grip 
 And in my world a girl is considered a biiiiiitch 
 Is money all that makes you move? 
 You ain't doin' what'cha s'posed to so you gots ta prove 
 Somethin' to the ones you love but you needs ta know 
 If you ain't doin' it for yourself it don't matter d'ooh! 
 It was a wake up, wake up, wake up... 
 Just to wake up, wake up, wake up... 
 I had to wake up, wake up wake up... 
 Get up, get up, get up... 
 Verse 3: snoop dogg 
 Uh, gonna work that motherfucker and do the percolatin 
 'Cause snoop dogg came back with the head raider 
 Al davis's? nah nigga tracy davis 
 The eastside long beach greatest 
 Criminal with style and boy you love that 
 Sit back relax and let me drop another rap 
 But this one's for the sisters and not the hoes 
 The ones who be groovin it on the step shows 
 Let a nigga in, I ain't diss ya friend 
 And like the staples I make sure we do it again 
 But don't blow a nigga up or show a nigga up 
 And don't think a nigga sprung 'cause you know a nigga fuck 
 Love is a house and you got the key 
 So give it to a nigga like a d-o-double g 
 I'm from the... 
 Chorus: snoop dogg 
 East-side lbc 
 Is what I claim but my game is dpg 
 And every hustler in my clique got to get his grip 
 And in my world a girl is considered a biiiiiitch 
 Is money all that makes you move? 
 You ain't doin' what'cha s'posed to so you gots ta prove 
 Somethin' to the ones you love but you needs ta know 
 If you ain't doin' it for yourself it don't matter d'ooh! 
 It was a wake up, wake up, wake up... 
 Just to wake up, wake up, wake up... 
 I had to get up, get up, get up... 
 It was a wake up, wake up, wake up...
