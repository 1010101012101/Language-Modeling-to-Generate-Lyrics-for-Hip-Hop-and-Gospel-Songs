I see you windin 'n' grindin up on that pole, 
 I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know 
 I wanna f*** you, you already know 
 I wanna f*** you, you already know 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Money in the air as mo feel grad you by your coat tail take you to the motel, hoe sale, 
 Don't tell, wont tell, baby said I don't talk dogg but she told on me, oh well, 
 Take a picture wit me, what the flick gon do, baby stick to me and ima stick on u, 
 If you pick me then ima pick on you, d-o-double g and I'm here to put this d*** on you, 
 I'm stuck on p**** n urs is right, wrip ridinin them poles and them doors is tight 
 And ima get me a shot for the end of the night 'cause p**** is p**** and baby ur p**** for life. 
 (Chorus: Akon)

 Shorty I can see you ain't lonely handfull of niggas 'n' they all got cheese, 
 So you lookin' at me now what's it gonna be just another tease far as I can see, 
 Tryin' get you up out this club if it means spendin' a couple dubs, 
 Throwin' bout 30 stacks in the back make it rain like that 'cause I'm far from a scrub, 
 U know my pedigree, ex-deala use to move phetamines, 
 Girl I spend money like it don't mean nothin' 'n' besides I got a thing for u. 
 (Chorus: Akon) 
 I see you windin 'n' grindin up on that pole, 
 I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know 
 I wanna f*** you, you already know 
 I wanna f*** you, you already know 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Mobbin' through club in low pressin I'm sittin' in the back in the smokers section (just smokin'), 
 Birds eye, I got a clear view, you can't see me but I can see u (baby I see u), 
 Its cool we jet the mood is set, 
 Your p**** is wet you rubbin your back and touchin your neck, 
 Ur body is movin' you humpin' 'n' jumpin' ur t****** is bouncin' you smilin' 'n' grinin' 'n' lookin' at me. 
 (Akon) 
 Girl 'n' while your looking at me I'm ready to hit the caddy right up on the patio move the patty to the caddy, 
 Baby you got a phatty the type I like to marry wantin to just give you everythin' 'n' that's kinda scary, 
 'Cause I'm lovin' the way you shake your ass, bouncin', got me tippin' my glass, 
 Lil' mully don't get caught up to fast but I got a thing for you. 
 (Chorus: Akon) 
 I see you windin 'n' grindin up on that pole, 
 I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know 
 I wanna f*** you, you already know 
 I wanna f*** you, you already know 
 (Chorus: Akon) 
 I see you windin 'n' grindin up on that pole,
