(Minister) 
 Say man may ushers, deacons, lock the door 
 (I love, to give you light) 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Yeah, first of all 
 Giving honor to God, and all the ministers on the pulpits 
 Ushers, deacons, and my lovely choir 
 They sound so beautiful, don't you agree? 
 Sing it sister, 
 Yeah, we'd like to welcome y'all inside this R&G 
 Rhythm and Gangsta: The Masterpiece 
 Such a, heavenly experience 
 Alchemist, break it down for me nephew 
 Let me preach to 'em one time, church 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 In the beginning as a child I was chosen 
 Though not knowing the reason while still my eyes opened 
 Whatever the purpose, I surfaced above the fog 
 Love was given to all, outside living the ball 
 As an adolescent, one black child, I had a message 
 To reach teaching the masses, I wrote my first passage 
 It was jotted down, created in the form of a rap 
 I'm young, living in the city of jackers and gang-banging 
 And dope dealing, cold feeling to be a product of niggas around you 
 Once you get on top they down you 
 But the temptation got me, streets caught me watching 
 I found myself grinding on the streets quite often 
 With a blue rag, banging the dub, fo'-fifth coffin 
 At the spot, 61st, forty blocks from the Eastside 
 Where most of the big homies had a glock and flossed the G-ride 
 Niggas throwing up hands but it wasn't no peace signs 
 Never fo' a second did I think to let my light shine 
 Hardheaded, thought I was grown, messing up 
 Disrespecting my home, not caring 'bout what moms what saying 
 And then I found out that mom wasn't playing 
 Today, I love you for it, back then, I couldn't understand 
 Get my life right, step it up, nigga be a man 
 Never be a victim, of what the system might hit you with 
 Through the stripes still gotta shine my light 
 I've grown, to comprehend the game; my name is Big Snoop Boss Dogg 
 Just a block and a phone call away 
 I've reached the status, of a modern day John Baptist 
 I'm preaching just what I practice 
 To each and all, I got a word from the Beach to across the globe 
 Man woman young and old 
 Don't gain the world, lose your soul to spite 
 Many circumstances Doggy gon' shine my light 'cause I love you 
 (I love, to give you light) 
 (Minister) 
 And the people that is locked up, locked down 
 And the people that's locked down 
 Also God, should purchase the new, Escalade 
 On 24's, with the spinning things, ha ha 
 I need you to, right now, look at your neighbors 
 Cause a lot of y'all think y'all going to heaven huh 
 And you ain't gon' go! 
 So I need you right now to, look at your neighbor 
 And say neighbor, say neighbor, you ain't going! 
 You ain't going!
