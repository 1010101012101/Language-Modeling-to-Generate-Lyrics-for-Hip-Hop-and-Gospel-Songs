 Nate Dogg: "Black folks can't never have no fun" 
 " These streets be... 
 Walkin' down the avenue

 From Hollywood to South Central 
 These streets be... 
 Crazy! 
 Long Beach to Compton 
 Always up to no good!

 Snoop Dogg: "Have a look outside, take a stroll with me 
 California lifestyle, you want to roll with me? 
 I can take you in and out, What's it gonna be? 
 Now as crazy as it is, you know its home for me 
 I would never leave it, you know that's wrong to me 
 I'm gonna stay down, ya see, we doin' the corners g 
 At your local liquor store, we gettin' some optimals, and 
 If I'm out of bounce then I got to cock the four." 
 Snoop Dogg: " Keep it on the low, on the w-w-w-west coast 
 Sign some autographs, and then I do get ghost 
 Heh, yeah, I love my folks but half of y'all fools is cut throats 
 On a real note, the streets that have you, 
 Guide you, lead you, mislead you, its fragile 
 Yeah, ya see, you gradually grow, and when you walking on my side, 
 I think you all need to know."

 Snoop Dogg: " On the One-Ten freeway floating back to the block 
 In the 7 Deuce coupe hoppin-hippin da hop 
 Sippin on some hen with my nephew infra red 
 Young pimp, on the grind, trying to line up some head 
 Have some fun, deal done, on the west coast we won 
 Don't matter where you're from, if you're old or young 
 Seesaw, we walk like ooh-la-la 
 F*** the law, we don't caught, we just do dot dot 
 Yeah, n**** we shakin the cops, you n***** out there just be making it hot 
 But don't trip, if you fakin alot 
 I'll break you, shake you, and take your spot 
 'Cause if you think that you gone, slip through California 
 Without getting banged on, brother you wrong."
