As I take another token toke of this stinky stanky stuff of boom back pipe lean back roll and another joint lean back and puff slowly 
 Whenever I'm making a record I get into my character trying to portray something I feel so that the whole world can believe in 
 "Does anybody no my name" Snoop Dogg 
 "What's my name" Snoop Dogg 
 "Hold on I want y'all to same my name like this"..snoop snoop snoop 
 There's seven wonders of the world, your about to witness the eighth 
 Scratch "nigga ask about me" 
 You don't believe me, 
 Yo cat roll out the blue carpet 
 Blue hat blue socks blue shoes too cool blue car blue house 
 Blue pit blue pool blue grass blue coup blue b ball hoop 
 What kind of phone you on loc ... I'm on a blue tooth 
 Talk to me nephew my nigga booh cat who he make 
 Pimpn on a bitch look so cool 
 Old school old fool still on a nigga first 
 Run up with that punk shit and I fill up a niggas shirt 
 Do it till it hurt 'cause it hurt so bad 
 Snoopy d o dub they can't touch your swag 
 Ol mark ass nigga better tuck your flag 
 'Cause when my music out loco ima smash your ass 
 Fuck him fuck her and fuck y'all too 
 'Cause I'm snoop dogg I'm so hood so true 
 And every time you see me I'm ol so blue
