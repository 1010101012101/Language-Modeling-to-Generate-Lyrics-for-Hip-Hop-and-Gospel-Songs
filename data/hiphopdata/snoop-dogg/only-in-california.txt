(Ice Cube) 
 Speak on it my nigga, speak on it (and my heat go) 
 Only in California 
 Where niggas pull heat and run up on ya (get your grind on) 
 Only in California (California) 
 Where niggas pull heat and run up ya (run up on ya) 
 Ice Cube the motherfucking don 
 Snoop Doggy Dogg a.k.a. The Doggfather 
 Mack 10 alias the Chicken Hawk 
 Gangstas with rules 
 'Cause you'se the niggas with no rules 
 Ain't got nothing to lose, we got everything to lose 
 Threw his ass in, he feel the fin of the barracuda 
 I negotiate Mack is the shooter 
 You the nigga on the journey strapped to this gurney 
 We break breads with accountants and attorneys 
 Currency never worry me (never) 
 Who's got the balls to murder me 
 Degree higher than a 33 
 Tell 'em what you drank (Hennessy) 
 Never tell 'em what you thinking 
 Never tell 'em where the body stinking 
 Fuck Lincoln, fuck Jackson, banking Franklin what you thanking 
 Hope your man come with the ransom 
 Let me see you dance on, no longer handsome 
 If you don't drop off than walk off, watch him, watch him 
 (Snoop Doggy Dogg) 
 Them west coast niggas is real set trippas 
 Will get you for them zippers, on a quest for them chippas 
 Sliding while we riding, not even hitting switches 
 Hanging at the high school getting at them young bitches 
 I got the dove sacks, homies love that (who got the bud) 
 Where the bud at, hollering at my big homeboy who fresh out 
 Hanging at my grand mama house, homie burnt out 
 What you gonna do when you get out of jail (speak on it) 
 I'm gonna have some fun 
 What do you consider fun a ounce and about five hun 
 So I put him on a move that I know about 
 Hooked him with a home girl from the South (good looking out) 
 Money made, plug a player in the game 
 Especially when he represent the same thing I claim 
 Damn they don't make niggas like they used to 
 That's probably why I keep a tight grip on my deuce deuce (that's real) 
 Cause everybody wanna be a star 
 In the city of dope, a.k.a. caviar 
 (Mack 10) 
 What have we a house full of cavi (no stress) 
 Well known riders from different sides of the West 
 Got the hi-zoes licking up so hard we sticking up niggas 
 Tired of the bullshit so we clicken up 
 Nigga please we ain't tripping off C's and B's 
 It's the West side Connect with the DPG's 
 For the cheese we jab with the gift of the gab 
 Always capping, Mack, Cube and Snoop rapping 
 Now how did that happen it's all good (fool) 
 So peep game If you could 
 Snoop be from Long Beach and I be from Inglewood 
 Now you despise cause it came to yo surprise 
 Two well known enemies now becoming allies 
 In Californ-I-A we parlay the G way 
 Some wear red and black and some sport blue and gray 
 So gangsta's don't dance we hang boogie and bang 
 So it's the Westside Connect with the Dogg Pound Gang 
 (Ice Cube) 
 There we have it, Ice motherfucking Cube 
 The big fish, rolling with the atomic dog 
 Snoop Doggy Dogg, down with the ring leader 
 Mack motherfucking 10, coming back once again 
 Nigga we make and spend nigga 
 And my heat goes boom boom boom boom boom boom
