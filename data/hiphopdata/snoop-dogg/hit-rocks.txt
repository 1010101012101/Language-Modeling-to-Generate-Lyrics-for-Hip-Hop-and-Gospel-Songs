'Cause were all a little strong 
 In the beach where the papers long 
 But as for me I only G when I'm buss'n rocks 
 Now when I wake up in the morining 
 And I get up out my bed 
 I fell good, oh yes I do 
 'Cause I still can give it up for you {What up 'cause} 
 'Cause where all a little strong 
 In the beach where the papers long 
 But as for me I only G when I'm buss'n rocks {Dogg Pound} 
 'Cause were all a little strong 
 In the beach where the papers long 
 But as for me I only G when I'm Buss'n rocks {So take that} 
 (Verse One:) 
 You know you gotta have heart 
 I told you niggas from the start 
 If I'm still in it I'm in it for life 
 Always stay down and keep my muthafucking game tight 
 'Cause ever since elementary or was it pre school cool 
 I was a muthafuckin fool 
 I had to have papers it was routine 
 A young nigga on a mission for them collard greens 
 I shake niggas, break niggas, make niggas, shank theyselves 
 For fuckin' with my wealth 
 And it'll catch on 
 'Cause if it don't it's on 
 And 'cause I ain't even slippin when I'm all alone 
 Sittin' back laughin' in the chronic zone 
 Clown me ya gone 
 Surround me it's on 
 And it's the same old song 
 Niggas paper so long 
 They call him Snoop Capone 
 So if you want me, get me, got me 
 Should of had shot him 
 But now they call me Snoop Gotti 
 And that's all I LBC betta yet 
 That's all I DPGC

 With some dogg pound gangstas in front of my home 
 Bigg 6, bigg 5 3's with ya bitch 
 My girls in the kitchen cookin up some fish 
 I'm blastin at this nigga that was trippin' 
 Knuckle head nigga, thought I was slippin 
 But I wasn't slippin I was on deck 
 I blast his ass peck peck know his shirts wet 
 Dead gone lights out 
 With no remorse, I had to take him out 
 I'm laughin' at this shit cause it was funny 
 Fuckin' with the dogg I take your life and your money 
 And now I dip too my spot 
 And set up shop with yo rocks 
 And bet nobody speak on the 8-7

 From my hood to your hood

 Where the bitches and the bud come free 
 And everybody listen to the D-O double G 
 Hoes on my dick, niggas on my nuts 
 People be lovin' me because I drop cuts

 See Snoop is that nigga who don't half to play funny 
 But I got yo honey up under my wing 
 'Cause she like that song that the bow wow sing

 But I'll put her on a hoe stroll make me 
 And even if she never saw me befo

 You know my game unbelievable baby 
 And it's strong enough to make your grandmama pay me
