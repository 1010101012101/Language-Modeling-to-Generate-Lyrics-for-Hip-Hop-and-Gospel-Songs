I wanna see you working baby, you're my dirty dancer 
 You're my dirty dancer, you're my dirty dancer, you're my dirty dancer 
 You're my dirty dancer, you're my dirty dancer, you're my dirty dancer 
 That's my dirty girl, she do her dirty dance 
 She get dirty money, for her dirty man 
 She give me everything, she take her dirty chance 
 She say I'm something new, not like her other man 
 Well let me do the thinking, this what I recommend 
 My nigger money talk that's what she comprehend 
 Say that sad story, you hear them violins? 
 And for a tall glass of Landy, here it is 
 She living in my lap, just like the two for one 
 See that's the fact, couple of stacks, she gonna leave with one 
 Shoot that weak gang, like a bb gun 
 And watch her do her thang, oh she gonna get it done 
 This girl body up the game, she a home run 
 She my dirty dancer, I owe her one 
 System overload, brain overdone, it's Big Snoop Dogg, 
 Gonna sing it Trey songs 
 You know money in the thang, all the way you're working in 
 Just so mean, 'cause I let away and take it in 
 Tell me are you ready? What's your answer darling? 
 'Cause you're my private dancer 
 I cash out, show me what you're working with 
 Back it up, drop it round for me 
 From the club to the crib, you could be my private dancer 
 You're my private dancer 
 You're my dirty dancer, you're my dirty dancer, you're my dirty dancer 
 You're my dirty dancer, you're my dirty dancer, you're my dirty dancer

 ...When I'm running, running, running to 
 I could do the lot up, ? 
 I could do the ? nothing like you

 You know money in the thang, all the way you're working in 
 Just so mean, 'cause I let away and take it in 
 Tell me are you ready? What's your answer darling? 
 'Cause you're my private dancer 
 I cash out, show me what you're working with 
 Back it up, drop it round for me 
 From the club to the crib, you could be my private dancer 
 You're my private dancer 
 You're my dirty dancer, you're my dirty dancer, you're my dirty dancer 
 You're my dirty dancer, you're my dirty dancer, you're my dirty dancer 
 She my dirty dancer, this her favorite song 
 And when she at the house, when she all alone 
 She in the mirror dancing nasty with no panties on 
 I see you girl, fantasizing about the scenting tone 
 Can't wait to put your heels, as the leathers on 
 I know you're ready show the world what you really? 
 Dancing like that, you might need a license 
 So ?, dancing while she setting prices 
 Damn, as dangerous but ?, do it right, go big and you get super rich 
 With that fat ass and them super hips 
 Slow motion mamy, we know you the shit 
 It's a dirty world so be a dirty chick 
 And now do them other girls just about chips 
 Let it take control and make it make sense 
 Money ain't a thang, you're my dirty chick 
 You know money in the thang, all the way you're working in 
 Just so mean, 'cause I let away and take it in 
 Tell me are you ready? What's your answer darling? 
 'Cause you're my private dancer 
 I cash out, show me what you're working with 
 Back it up, drop it round for me 
 From the club to the crib, you could be my private dancer 
 You're my private dancer 
 You're my dirty dancer, you're my dirty dancer, you're my dirty dancer 
 You're my dirty dancer, you're my dirty dancer, you're my dirty dancer 
 I wanna see you work it baby 
 You're my dirty dancer, you're my dirty dancer, you're my dirty dancer 
 You're my dirty dancer, you're my dirty dancer, you're my dirty dancer.
