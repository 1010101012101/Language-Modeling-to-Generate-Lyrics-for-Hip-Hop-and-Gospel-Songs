 Nigga, you know you gotta have heart 
 I told you niggas from the start 
 If I'm still in it, I'm in it for life 
 Always stay down and keep my motha fuckin' game tight 
 Cause ever since elementary, or was it pre-school quik? 
 I was a motha fuckin' fool 
 I had to have papers it was routine 
 A young nigga on a mission for them collard greens 
 I, shake niggas 
 Break niggas 
 Make niggas, shank theyselves 
 For fuckin' with my wealth (nigga) 
 And it'll catch on 
 'Cause if it don't, it's on 
 And, 'causez, I ain't even slippin' when I'm all alone 
 Sittin' back loungin' in the chronic zone 
 Clown me ya gone 
 Surround me, it's on 
 Get the money you're gone 
 My niggas' paper so long 
 They call him snoop capone 
 So if you want me, get me, got me 
 Should have shot him 
 But now they call me snoop gotti 
 And that's all I lbc 
 Betta yet, that's all I dpgc 
 'Cause we're all a little strong 
 In the beach, where the paper's long 
 But as for me

 Choppin' game on the phone 
 Smokin' a zone

 My girls in the kitchen, cookin' up some fish and 
 I'm blastin' at this nigga that was trippin' 
 O, knuckle head nigga, thought I was slippin' 
 But I wasn't slippin', I was on deck 
 I blast his ass, peck peck now his shirt's wet 
 Dead, gone, light's out 
 With no remorse, I had to take him out 
 I'm laughin' at this shit cause it was funny 
 Fuckin' with the dogg I take your life and your money 
 And then I dip to my spot (dip dip) 
 And set up shop with yo rocks (motha fucka) 
 And nobody gon' speak on the 8-7 
 Cause still, all doggs go to heaven

 Where the bitches and the bud come free 
 And everybody listen to the d-o double g 
 Hoes on my dick, niggas on my nuts 
 People be lovin' me because I drop cuts 
 That makes sense, it make big money 
 See snoop is that nigga who don't hafta play funny 
 But I got yo honey, up under my wing 
 'Cause she like the song that the bow-wow sing 
 I'll put her in a cling 
 I won't buy her a ring 
 But I'll put her on the hoe-stroll to make me some green 
 And even if she never even saw me befo' 
 There's just no way that she can tell me no 
 You know my game's unbelievable baby (uh uh, uh uh) 
 And it's strong enough to make your grandmama pay me 
 'Cause we're all a little strong 
 In the beach, where the paper's long 
 But as for me

 Dogg pound
