Mama in the kitchen, mama in the kitchen 
 My mama in the kitchen, whippin, we flippin 
 Mama in the kitchen, mama in the kitchen 
 My mama in the kitchen, whippin, we flippin 
 Ayo, I know you like it, like it, I'm winnin' 
 Call me the lioness, I'm killin' killin' competition 
 I'm the one that you've been waitin on, so thrilling 
 You should get a taste of this, so filling 
 I'm in the kitchen with the gumbo 
 Got bars, chyeah, dumb flow 
 I just stepped just a force 1 
 I got a life huh, you should've bought one 
 Them niggas start starin', it's beyond this galaxy 
 You wanna go to my reality... show 
 I'm fresh up out the kitchen 
 Now pay attention what the world been missin' 
 You they say I'm the antidote, better yet the cure 
 Feel the potency 'cause the product is pure 
 Runnin' runnin' through your veins, guaranteed you get addicted 
 Constantly craving this audio prescription 'cause 
 Ayo, I know you like it, like it, I'm it 
 You might be in the building but I've built this shit 
 You just a visitor, I picked it out brick by brick 
 Call me the architect of yo future, not a sitcom 
 You said you ain't seen me often 
 Well, most of my currency is foreign 
 And I stay up stay up on a plane 
 Really don't matter, you could never ever touch my lane 'cause
