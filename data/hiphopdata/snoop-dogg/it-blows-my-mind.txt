 "The chronics blowin"(x4) 
 Blowin' chronic to me is like a tradition to me 
 I gotz the pid-amps so sit down and listen to me 
 "Don't go against me boo, go wit me" 
 We could blow it all together and bobby brown and whitney

 Niggaz search a nigga but they never find in my vomit 
 I got the stash spot, my cash got 
 A lot of mutha fukin fo police shots

 I'm livin' my life 'n' never puttin' my gun up 
 Drinkin' my drink 'n' imma smoke that blunt.
