One two three into to the four, snoop doggy dogg and david t. is at the door 
 Ready to get my mack on, so back on up

 San fernadez valley, now you know you in trouble, 
 It ain't nothin' but a g thang baby, 
 Two loked out niggers going crazy, 
 Ugly ass hoes never phase me, unbeleiveable, so allow me to amaze thee.
