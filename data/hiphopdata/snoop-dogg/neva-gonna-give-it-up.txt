(Verse One: Kurupt) 
 Smash, just before you talk spaz out 
 Hittin' the switch, then hittin' the stash 
 Before the year 2000, all the computers crash 
 I'm gone homeboy, this the hood where it's on homeboy 
 I'ma live long homeboy 
 Too deep, too strong homeboy 
 We rollin' too deep with two zones homeboy 
 It's on homeboy 
 Songs with two candy-painted bronze homeboy 
 D-A-Z, I can't believe this nigga gon' trip 
 He's nothin' but a busta, bitch-ass mothafucka 
 With Snoop in the coop, Warren, Nate, and big Tray Dee 
 Big see-Style and Mitch made to be 
 Shine Dogg gettin' super-high lit 
 High-flyin' high super-duper high 
 We super-duper fly 
 I put ya in the mix 
 I ain't with that Kibbles-N-Bits shit 
 Bitch, where's the grip? 
 (Chorus: Nate Dogg *singing*, (Snoop Dogg)) 
 I'm still a Dogg Pound nigga, I'm Neva Gonna Give It Up (DPG {G}, C) 
 Neva Gonna Give It Up 
 C'mon homies give it up 
 (Dpg {g}, c) 
 I'm still a Dogg Pound nigga, I'm Neva Gonna Give It Up (DPG {G}, C) 
 Neva Gonna Give It Up 
 C'mon homies give it up 
 (Verse Two: Warren G, Nate Dogg *singing*) 
 (Warren G) 
 What I'ma do, I'mm bang on the beat 
 What I'ma do, can't cock and serve heat 
 You lookin' at me, I'm scopin' on you 
 But you don't know my shit is right nigga, so fuck you 
 Everybody talkin' 'bout Money Ain't A Thang 
 Everybody talkin' 'bout how they gang bang 
 If you was hard as me, I'm as hard as you 
 Cutthroats and bud smoke, I'm an Eastside loc 
 So don't let the crossover fool ya 
 I been down since '81, LB top gun biyatch 
 (Nate Dogg) 
 Platinum-ass records that be payin' bills 
 Dogg Pound niggas, they be bangin' still 
 Money-makin' niggas, and they bona fide 
 Them money-makin' niggas still down ta ride 
 All them otha' niggas, they be claimin' thangs 
 Scary-ass niggas wasn't born ta bang 
 Hang wit' DPG and I can give ya game 
 Comin' from the hood, you can't be changin' games 
 (Snoop) 
 Dpg (g), c 
 (Break: Kurupt *talking*) 
 Yeah, bitch-ass niggas... Dogg Pound Gangstas... 
 Fuck y'all!

 I'm still a Dogg Pound nigga, I'm Neva Gonna Give It Up 
 Neva Gonna Give It Up 
 C'mon homies give it up 
 (Verse Three: Tray Dee, Snoop Dogg, Soopa Fly) 
 (Tray Dee) 
 Yeah, I'm from that clique that slap clips with hollow-point tips 
 And serve bitch-niggas quick with this gangsta shit 
 Tray Dee, ya heard of me, murder be my hobby 
 Bangin' and slangin' in dangerous robberies 
 Fuck a mask, you bustas duck when I blast 
 I take the cash, and put a cap up in that ass 
 Saggin' with my rag, 'bout to drag the street 
 Triple-X sweatshirt with blue Chucks on feet 
 Killa instincts keep me ahead of my foes 
 Neva doze when I rose, let the chrome explode 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Man I wish a bitch would get me fo' some child support 
 I stuck my foot up her ass, like a super sport 
 Down shit, Pound shit, gangsta 
 Fo'eva', Wheneva', Howeva', down fo' whateva' 
 Recognize game when it hits ya 
 Nigga, if ya slip up Doggy Dogg's gonna get-'cha 
 Been doin' that thang-thang, long trynna' slang 'caine 
 Just before I was taught, how ta gangbang 
 All my peers through the years know 
 That Snoop Dogg ain't nothin' but a fool do' 
 And if ya run up on that man trynna do-low 
 That's when he, pull out his homey, who, you know 
 Man I been through so much and I'm still goin' through it 
 But fuck all that, I got ta stay into it 
 I knew the job was dangerous when I took it 
 Shit, a nigga didn't even overlook it 
 I was so eager, just trynna' get involved 
 But now's I gots ta represent for me and my Doggs 
 (Soopa Fly) 
 Yeah, '94, became a D-O, double-G, P-O, U-N-D, Gangsta 
 Now you can see me smokin' dank in neighborhood, pranksta' 
 Play a trick, quick inimate, then out, no doubt 
 Paperboy wit' a new route 
 When I'm in front, they watch behind me 
 Mission: Crush, ready to bust, grab the Tom-my 
 Gun, keep one, I role with the heat-seeka's 
 Stash the gauge, pass the .9 to my nee-ga [nigga] 
 Roll, keep slow, peep, Po-Po 
 Creep slow, ready ta smash with the fo'-fo' 
 I go for broke wit' loc niggas who toke guns 
 Neva understood niggas high-up with low funds 
 Smoke one, represent my seaside ocean 
 Eastside motion, we slide coastin' through 
 Mothafuckaaz! haha! 
 (Break: Snoop Dogg *talking* ("DPG {G}, C" said 4 times in background)) 
 Dogg Pound... mothafuckin' Gangstas... 
 1999, back up in this BI-YAI-ITCH! 
 Eastside up, Eastsidaz! 
 And niggas thought we fell off... 
 [Chorus: Nate Dogg *singing*, (Snoop Dogg *talking*), ("DPG {G}, see" said 8 
 Times in a row, then once again)] 
 I'm still a Dogg Pound nigga, (Dogg Pound in this mothafucka)
