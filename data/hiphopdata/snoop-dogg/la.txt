 Ya heard me 
 I just touched down at this LAX 
 I'm looking for these girls on this LAX 
 Trying to find them niggas with that LA best 
 Dodging them niggas with that LA Stress 
 See I'm a visitor I'm a LA guest 
 I got to be aware on how the LA dress 
 'Cause if it comes down I might get LA stretched 
 I ain't trying to be a trophy on no LA desk 
 Some niggas walk up tossing LA sets 
 I guess this supposed to be some type of LA test 
 Better watch the girls with the LA chest 
 A lot of plastic in those LA breasts 
 I hit the Crenshaw where they LA stunt 
 Seen a lot of sixty four's and LA trucks 
 Seen a lot of girls with them LA butts 
 A lot of niggas with them dickies and chucks (ya feel me) 
 Yo I spend a lot of time on this LA coast 
 Out here trying to do the LA most 
 Chauffeur driven Phantom like a LA ghost 
 In the back with a drink take a LA toast 
 I spend a lot of time in them LA heels 
 With them models actresses and them LA heels 
 To my lawyers office for a LA deal 
 Cut the check for some LA kneels 
 Now I'm off to Rodeo just to LA shop 
 Still getting dirty looks from some LA cops 
 You than thought since Rodney King LA stopped 
 When they burn the LA watts 
 I send a lot of love to my LA brothers 
 My Latinos and my Negroes in them LA colors 
 My blessings go out to those LA mothers 
 Know that Nelly is an LA lover 
 Guess who just stepped in the place (the Midwest) 
 It's your OG homie Nate (all day) 
 My homie snoop and Nelly (La) 
 And we all up in your face (all day) 
 Different questions everyday (the Midwest) 
 I got my answer in my way (all day) 
 Yeah they all got something to say (LA) 
 From St. Louis to La (all day)
