(Snoop Dogg) 
 My mama told me never ever trust one, bust one and break them 
 Be about your paper nigger take it 
 Everyday's a hustle about these haters and my neck 
 Something trying to get a check 
 But most ... does it, whose wanna call what it wasn't 
 Try to kiss a nigger on in public, bitches you crazy? 
 I switch pimping not pussies should I heard it all before 
 I ain't no motherfucker rookie 
 I'm a grown bitch ...about the g's, I ain't tripping off these walls 
 You know these rats are after g's 
 Messing with my focus, the locust on the ground 
 Baby focus your dick and keep your focus off my time 
 Stay in the lane that I make for you to chill 
 Until then it's been real, I gotta handle business 
 And you I know we're in it, see tripping gets you nowhere 
 Cause bitch I'm on that 
 I don't need no bitch bitch bitch all over me 
 Tripping and calling my phone always like it 
 I don't need no bitch bitch bitch cause starting shit can only bitch don't even try it 
 I'm out here crying that's why 
 I don't need no bitch bitch bitch 
 (Devin the Dude) 
 We used to rock to the rhythm that didn't stop 
 Now you telling me I need to be getting out and go find me a bitch 
 'Cause it's over and through 
 But why do I need a bitch when I got you 
 I don't mean it like it sounds, but we used to be a team 
 Yo we used to have a dream yo we used to put our things together 
 Now it's dividing... negative, feeling inside, ...switching 
 They call my ... fuck one that once sucked my dick and find it nothing 
 I don't need a, don't find, nothing to drink, I don't feed them 
 Never mind them, I stay in front, I used to chase behind them 
 No, I don't want to find them 
 I don't need no bitch bitch bitch all over me 
 Tripping and calling my phone always like it 
 I don't need no bitch bitch bitch cause starting shitt can only bitch don't even try it 
 I'm out here crying that's why 
 I don't need no bitch bitch bitch 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Hell no, I don't need one, and all that talking and fussing bitch you can miss me 
 I put these signs 12 down on a 10 speed, before I let a bitch get the best of me 
 I don't need no bitch bitch bitch 
 The recipe for danger, phone checking the recipe for anger 
 I'll call my gang but I don't wanna bang ya 
 And I can tell how you tell all your friends about my ... and my ... bitch 
 Really I'm not perfect stranger, which turned you to the perfect stalker 
 Body like miss parker, maybe get little darker 
 And I'ma have to pass on that a-s you was too much in the first place 
 Never understood when it was ... 
 And that ... boys in the worst ways, you need to detox, bitch see dr. dre 
 Cause crazy ain't gonna get it, and tripping get you nowhere 
 Cause bitch I'm on that, bitch I'm on that 
 I don't need no bitch bitch bitch all over me 
 Tripping and calling my phone always like it 
 I don't need no bitch bitch bitch cause starting shit can only bitch don't even try it 
 I'm out here crying that's why 
 I don't need no bitch bitch bitch 
 You need to quit talking crazy 
 I don't need no bitch 
 You need to quit talking crazy
