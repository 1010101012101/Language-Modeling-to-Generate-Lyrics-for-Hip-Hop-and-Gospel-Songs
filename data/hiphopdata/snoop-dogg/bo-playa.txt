 Many people know we know about this pimp game 
 But I'm sure they wanna know about this pimp game 
 And to me it ain't no motha fuckin' thang 
 To give it to you plain and simple cause you know its played 
 Holla at 'em doggy dogg, go and do that thang 
 Ok, son, tell you like my nigga +Pootie Tang+ 
 I got that bounce, to make her booty swang 
 That little cutie thang, fraid she's a beauty bang 
 (Snoop Dogg 1) 
 Rollin' with a player cause that's what he was 
 And dedicated to his paper, G's up 
 On his bitches (????) 
 And if the law-boys pull him over he won't freeze up 
 He got the heeta fa heeta in the keys-ah 
 With a pocket full of big-faced visa's 
 They say its cheaper to keep her now baby ease up, 
 Kick back and blaze some of these trees up. 
 And now sit your ass in the trees-ah 
 And do me a favor and turn the music up. 
 Should I slap her, or should I freak-ah 
 I'll take the strong and you can have the weak-ah. 
 Speak when spoken to 
 Yeah I broke a few. 
 And by the way I was hoping you 
 Had a freak for me and a freak for you. 
 I make her do for us 
 The same thing you've been wantin her to do for months 
 Many people know we know about this pimp game

 This is the chairman of the board, 
 The Arch Bishop Don Magic Juan. 
 Big Snoop Dogg is a Bo$$ Playa. 
 As a matter of fact, 
 I was there when he was crowned "Bo$$ Playa". Chhhyea 
 (Snoop dogg 2) 
 I had, 3 on my right arm, and 4 on my left 
 Lime 'n' green 'n' gold who was sharp to death 
 Had to catch my breath, watch my step. 
 Playin' this game, you can holla at the ref. 
 And call a time-out 
 Before you put your dime out. 
 Stop, pause, rewind, before you put your rhyme out. 
 And go to the Wizard of Oz 
 To tell him that u r tryin' to get yourself a brand new heart 
 A brand new start 
 Cause you realized you had never played your part 
 And that was smart. 
 It's like a art the way I ar-tic-ulate 
 And break these bitches from state to state. 
 See, I've been the flyest since I came out the gate 
 I ain't ask for it homie I just shake 'n' bake. 
 I won't fake to make you by my take 
 I say a prayer to my Lord just to keep my faith 
 Fuck straight.

 Will you steal for me? (Yes I will) 
 Will you kill for me? (Yes I will) 
 Would you lie to me? (Never) 
 Would you die for me? (Whatever)

 Big Snoop Dogg let you know 
 That this game ain't for no lame. 
 If you got heart, you can play this game. 
 But if your heart ain't right, 
 We got a remedy for that, too. 
 You got to go see the Wizard 
 To get you some heart. 
 And arch-bishop Don Magic Juan is the Wizard 
 That's got the game, for them lame. 
 Bo$$ Playa! Bo$$ Playa! That's what this game is all about.

 Gangsta, Gangsta, where you been? 
 Runnin' round the corner hustlin' wit brotha and them. 
 Youngsta, Youngsta, you at it again? 
 Poppin' gats motha fucka when you know you got his 
 I don't think that you should be in the streets like that 
 You know you the fashion type of cat 
 Always in stores, with major whores 
 Doin' things, bling-bling. 
 West Coast runnin', lovin', hustlin', 
 Smokin', always chokin' indo weed 
 With the sticky in yo hand fa sho 
 Everybody round, 'cause they know you got mo' 
 Where's the Cristal, you like to get wild 
 You like to dip in yo six and shit 
 Rollin' through them streets, poppin' CPT. 
 L.B.C. Rollin' with me, oh.
