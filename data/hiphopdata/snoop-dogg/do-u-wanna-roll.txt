Something about the westcoast 
 That makes me thank the east {Eastside} 
 It's something about the westcoast (Ah, yeah) 
 That makes me thank the east (Help me sing) 
 Say you wanna roll [Do you wanna roll] 
 In my '64 
 And have some fun, baby 
 Let's have some fun 
 We'll get low [Let's get low] 
 And that's fo' sho' [That's fo' sho'] 
 And hop on doves, baby 
 And have some fun 
 Now check us out 
 From when I met you at the roller rink 
 Kinda funny with your Shasta drink 
 Braids with barrettes that were white and pink 
 While the kissin' we did was on the cheek 
 Remember like yesterday 
 We hop on a bus and just right away 
 Knew you'd be mine somehow, some way 
 And I must say I do 
 Say you wanna roll [Think I wanna roll] 
 In my '64 
 And have some fun, baby 
 Let's have some fun 
 Oh, we'll get low [We'll get low] 
 And that's fo' sho' [That's fo' sho'] 
 And hop on doves, baby
