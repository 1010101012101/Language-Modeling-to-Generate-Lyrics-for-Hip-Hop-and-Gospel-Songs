Ok... (sniff snuff), got some for me? 
 (San Quinn) 
 Yeah, yeah, listen to the story I'm about to tell 
 Another tale about that yayo 
 Little girl once in a city suite 
 14 introduced to the streets 
 Started from weed, big smoke outs 
 Before you could exhale, blunt in your mouth 
 Sham, Nay, blew you blew 
 Now you need something else to do 
 A new high to try, a new place to go 
 Introduced to the yay to the yo 
 House full of girls, old and young 
 Playin' it the table takin' one on ones 
 Use dollar bills just to snort the lines 
 You see the big girls do it so of 
 Course it's fine 
 Cocaine enforced on your mind 
 Now blow, then they blow in ya time 
 (Dre Dog) 
 Let's go- 
 Ayo for yayo 
 Walk around with yayo, all in my naso 
 I must have been crazo 
 (San Quinn) 
 Chompin and compin kicks some blind people with they fits 
 Where you fit? 
 Fillmore Street is where you sit 
 Don't go in the house till you move a zip 
 Worked a day and night shift 
 To stay awake, a nigga might sniff 
 Not too much 'cause you might slip 
 Instead of 28, you cookin 26 
 Keep a gat in the pack in the sock 
 Take a couple of tubes, then its back to the block 
 Back to the service out the sack 
 Experimentin with that salt, what about that crack, huh? 
 One try, another try without a doubt 
 Papered out, always at the Potter house 
 Day time, night time, nigga part it out 
 Couldn't been a papered up power house 
 (Nickatina) 
 Ayo for yayo 
 Walk around with yayo, all in my nasal 
 I must have been craze yo 
 (San Quinn) 
 Like you and I, super high, like superfly 
 One more line, one more rhyme like groovy and fine 
 I can keep you down, and get you high 
 You like to blow? like boston george, you want some more, for you and your whores 
 I kick off wars, and get behind walls 
 And corporate doors, executive nose sore 
 Rich man, high, eight balls and quarters 
 They call me, placin' they orders 
 Bring me across the border, buyin the cake 
 Before I'm sold, they take the taste 
 Snortin, have it, not with affordin 
 Some use me, strictly out of boredom 
 I hooked people before man, I warned them 
 I took many people out before them 
 Doin' my job, connected wit the mob 
 Got President Bush, Whitney, and Bob 
 Many others all walks of life have one on ones with me every night 
 (Nicky T) 
 Ayo for yayo 
 Walk around with yayo, all in my nasal 
 I must have been craze yo 
 (Big sniff) That's some good coke
