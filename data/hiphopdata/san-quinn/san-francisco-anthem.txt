Oh holy come to San Francisco 
 Oh holy come to San Fran... Fran 
 In, in, in, in the streets of San Francisco 
 In, in, in, in the streets of San Fran... Fran 
 Rap: 
 I rep my city, nobody flyer 
 Say something different, you a goddamn liar 
 Block on fire, streets stay cookin 
 Girl, if you lookin' for a boyfriend, keep on looking 
 Downtown, Filmore, something like quinn 
 Uptown Harlem, yeah we ballin 
 Frisco, Frisco home of the brave 
 I don't know about y'all, but we gettin' paid 
 All of the TV, still ain't changed 
 Good in the hood, everywhere I go 
 Got a packet full of hitters everywhere I go 
 Say you from the hood but you never lay low 
 Ay, Hp money, like you love me 
 Sunny down, towerside let's get money 
 Bank, Bank three story 
 Game this movement 
 Drink crunk music 
 Son let's do it 
 Oh holy some to San Francisco 
 From San francisco 
 Oh holy come to San Fran... Fran 
 In, in, in, in the streets of San Francisco 
 In, in, in, in the streets of San Fran... Fran 
 Rap: 
 It's a city situation, I keep Hunters point 
 In thee equation 
 I'm married to the block, you just got relations 
 And you need a doctor to play with my patients 
 You hatin', you getting it broad day 
 My lights shine like the lights on broadway 
 Never gave a broad away 
 Cause in Filmore they get in the paid 
 My Hp, that be me 
 Check my street crib 
 I'm in the track all day 
 I just count the cash 
 Now my whip back like Alcatraz 
 Now, I want the bars of fabel 
 We got the cable car, but my car got cable 
 Bootleg, I'm on demand like comcast 
 But when she squares, I won't contrast 
 Oh holy some to San Francisco 
 From San francisco 
 Oh holy come to San Fran... Fran 
 In, in, in, in the streets of San Francisco 
 In, in, in, in the streets of San Fran... Fran 
 Rap: 
 See it goes to no book 
 Anybody get took, from me 
 Speed hangs to lee 
 Ali we bush 
 Come over to the top of the bridge 
 To get snarrow 
 The grip go down right on young Fil, young Filmore, Fare-rel 
 Golden gate treasures 
 Got in warfare, Sf delinna 
 Roll in like flaw, battling to such people 
 We in ** you will get killed 
 Cruel nut mr. C 
 Hit man Rp 
 Much love from SFC 
 And no bricks in the back in candle stick 
 House of twin peaks, view panoramics 
 Still with the cannon, 40, 50 calliper 
 5 time champion, destroy any challenger 
 Get like berries, score like cherries 
 Still right here, Filmore to marry
