Girl you makin' all that money 
 Don't let nobody treat you treat u. You makin' all that money 
 Don't let nobody treat you treat u. 
 Booty club 25 grand 
 Fat pockets look at my pants 
 We too deep look at my clan 
 Polo clothes look at my brand 
 Dro I came here to look at y'all dance 
 They say I make it rain so I'm kickin out grain 
 My pockets spittin' 7 and my hummer spittin' 3 
 I spent my left so that's 20 some g's 
 Just got started and we don't wanna leave 
 10 for the clit now put yo hands on yo knees 
 Naw I ain't broke but I'm still on E 
 I'm broke like a mother fucker pills on me 
 Real low key shaking hard for the bread 
 Still in schoool so she smart in the head 
 *First man seen her then we all went runnin* 
 Dumb for a strip makin' all that money 
 She dance for you like she dance for me 
 She'll handle you like she handle me she know I came up in that lomborgin 
 Shakin her stuff like a tamborine 
 All my diamonds are tangerine 
 Throwin' this money like Dan marine 
 All shawty need is a tamper ring 
 She'll jump when you call like a trampoline 
 Got my motor running like vaseline give me what I want you can have the cream 
 My drop top chevy so apple green 
 These niggas in the club they trap with me 
 So much money they after me 
 That mazaratti ain't *strappin me* carats on my neck call me young joe bundy 
 Blaze up the saddle be on platinum 21's 
 Dro 
 (Chorus) RPT X2 
 Do it one time for the whole club heat, do it one time for the whole magic city, do it one time for the girls in the struggle,
