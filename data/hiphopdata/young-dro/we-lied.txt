 My girlfriend 
 Ay ay, check this out 
 I said I weren't gon never hurt you 
 You said you ain't gon never hurt me 
 We lied 
 Little melt 
 How could I do this to myself 
 I lied to her 
 And plus I lied to myself 
 Nothing's left 
 The relationship done lost its breath 
 It stopped breathing 
 It died last season 
 I think about you leaving 
 'Cause you a sexy little creature 
 Thought I was lying 
 When I said I ain't fuck Alicia 
 And I don't wanna hear what Mika said 
 And fuck Keisha 
 I betcha they'll fuck me 
 All you gotta do is leave us 
 Make you out a believer 
 We some grown ass people 
 Dem bitches get on my nerves 
 That's why I be smokin' reefer 
 First we start arguing 
 Then I open up my ether 
 When I open up my ether 
 The shit gets deeper 
 At first you start throwin' shit 
 Then you start bowin' shit 
 Running round hollerin' 
 Tryin' guess bout who I'm hoein' wit 
 You know who I'm goin' wit 
 I be there when you doin' it 
 I done hit the do' no latter than one in the morning 
 Man 
 It's been a long spin loving this woman 
 At first we was in love in the beginning 
 It was strong then 
 Now you talkin' 'bout you don't want me 
 Well gone then 
 If we don't get along 
 Why we talkin' on the phone then 
 First I walked out 
 Now you want me to come home then 
 You said we would stay together 
 Why the fuck am I alone then? 
 I said I weren't gon never hurt you 
 You said you ain't gon never hurt me 
 We lied 
 Look man this shit killing me 
 I'm reacting like Willie B. 
 Beatin' on my chest 
 Y'all niggaz ain't feeling me 
 Cards you dealing me 
 I'm like 
 What the fuck is you givin' me 
 We both got injuries 
 Now we play religiously 
 Same hoes hatin' on us 
 Numbers they be slipping me 
 You rippin me 
 You temptin me 
 You thought that you was clippin' me? 
 I knew you got them stacks when you took em 
 I knowed instantly 
 Left the shit for you to go shopping 
 To get some Bemanes 
 You acting like a enemy 
 Why the fuck is you hittin' me? 
 Hoes tellin' lies to you 
 Why aren't you defending me? 
 Now I'm finna cheat 
 Now I'm finna creep 
 Now I'm finna have different women in my V 
 Why 
 She lied on me 
 Why 
 Fly homie 
 Fuck working it out 
 I'm finna go and ride homie 
 Now I'm sleeping here 
 Creeping here 
 Bout to spend a week here 
 Guess who I'm fuckin' round with 
 That bitch Keisha, yeah

 At first we was in love in the beginning

 Game international

 Great grand national 
 I love her 
 I ain't said shit 
 I don't know who to share it with 
 I'm talkin' bout my girl 
 This who I be breakin' bread with 
 Dread shit 
 Selling dro 
 She never let the feds know 
 This house I'm in used to be full of love 
 But where it go 
 Man I wanna let it go 
 I love you 'cause I said so 
 I cheated and regret it though 
 I let my cousin Tres know 
 Told me get a thousand roses 
 Plus seven more 
 We would never hurt one other 
 That's what we said though 
 We lied gone and say it, folk 
 We miss each other extra though 
 But guess what I can't get out my head 
 Guess what we said, folk 
 I said I weren't gon never hurt you 
 You said you ain't gon never hurt me
