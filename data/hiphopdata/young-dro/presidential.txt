{Chrous x2} 
 Anythang you want I can get my hands on it 
 If you keep comin' put some extra grams on it 
 You know I keep glad to prove ya ass homey 
 If it ain't presidential we don't g0t damn want it 
 {Verse one} 
 My Chevy look cinnamon my bitch is a Indian 
 Plus I'm bilingual I be talkin' like domnican (Como Estas) 
 Think I look innocent, bentley on 26" 
 Ridin' round sellin dope to e'rybody in this bitch 
 E'rybody get a brick I break 'em down randomly 
 Whoever try and tell on me 
 I shoot they whole family 
 Fish scale jammer g I'm clean with my mammal feet 
 Dope boy, I be sellin dream like a jamboree 
 Paint the rica tangerine beatin' like a tamborine 
 Mac 90 magazine longer than the back 
 Lean back plead to the whole block for the crack g 
 Y'all 'member me I had the chevy with black d 
 Neck from black d, white d, purple d, cardier frame 
 Wood steve erkel d, nigga keep chirpin me they courteous 
 They work for me straight drop glad got these haters wanna murder me 
 Trans am homie with that blam blam homie 
 Dead fresh I look like I got that yam don't it 
 Drop top spider with that candy yam on it 
 Its hard to stick on my block 
 I spray pam on it 
 If it ain't presidential we don't goddamn want it 
 Bentley truck bitch me and god damn boney 
 I sell a brick to whoever god damn want it 
 And guess who the feds is, my god damn homie (you a lie) 
 Tha spy cam finally takin' picture while I order out 
 I get the bricks and sort 'em out and pump em' like the carter house 
 Case is out I fought em' out and plus I gotta quarter house 
 Breakdowns at the dead end 
 That's the slaughterhouse 
 I'm hangin' out in Germany 
 The mafia concernin me 
 My nickname schoolboy but ain't nobody learning me 
 Burnin heat poke one in the pot this is 63 
 Is'all in the wrist scale fish nigga mention me 
 You can't see dro I am Lou Ferrigno (grr) 
 Green benzito rim big like my ego 
 Bricks come from chico and my old school amigo 
 They call me action jackson like my first name tito (what the fuck?) 
 The first chain three co berry car I'm very far 
 High up off the groud 
 Man I do this shit to every car 
 Betty crock betty rock, 
 Got this shit from very far 
 All that walkin' all up on me gon' getcha Chevy popped 
 Fenetie mob fresh and successful in da kompressor 
 I hop up on pacatis and relium like the messer 
 Helium got ya chest up 
 Really you bout to mess up 
 Gold point bullets you really don't have to fess up, neck up 
 I am flamboyant 
 You so annoying 
 Drop top jag at ya pad cho yoing yoing 
 When I pull up on yo bitch in the benz 
 She glowing, so much ice in my mouth 
 When I talk it be snowing
