 Sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, 
 I'll be putting it down in a minute 
 How long will it take, before your 
 Screaming my name, oh baby 
 We should rip off our clothes and get naked 
 I'll be like oh yeah! you'll be like oh yeah! 
 Partying down bumping here 
 Making us sweat 
 Put her lil' pedicure up on my chest 
 And we gon' sweat, sweat, sweat 
 I'll be like oh yeah! you'll be oh yeah! 
 Making us sweat.
