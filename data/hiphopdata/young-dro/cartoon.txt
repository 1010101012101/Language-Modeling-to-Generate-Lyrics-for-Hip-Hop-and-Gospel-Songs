Ride wit a Chooley 
 Broads wanna do me 
 Get Fresh Louie 
 Ice-berg Goofie 
 Cops wanna 2 me 
 I live like a movie 
 6's on the dualy 
 Niggas scared of me, my potnas say 
 They beggin for the chopper play 
 Body guard killas got a house where Kevin Costner stay 
 Might just play some golf today 
 Never put the glock away 
 Jackas try to 2-step I make they ass rock away 
 Elegant, catch me at a symphany and opera play 
 Paint the rolly popper gray, Blow the whole top away 
 No matter what the coppers say 
 Still move a block a day 
 All you niggas pop or play and label Jimmy Hoffelay 
 Rebel outlaw, that's the same shit that Pac would say 
 Niggas gotta walk away, My chopper long as Dr. J 
 Amarilla gots to play, I might hop on the yacht today 
 Not today but fuck it Ima kill 'em in the block today 
 Trans Am wit the candy coat 
 Wait till ya see the Phantom though 
 Spend dollars with ya ho eatin grapes and cantelope 
 Shawty said she wanna see me naked like De'angelo 
 Guts on deck, 4 playin' Alabama ho 
 I can have an' ho, I ain't want it from an' ho 
 Hustlin in the buildin so what you sayin' ho 
 Y'all pop loot cris, We drinkin' that old cris 
 This cost mo' bitch, that '74 shit 
 Bankhead nigga eatin octopus and swordfish 
 My whole clique gorgeous, say my name 'n' forge it 
 Bake faggot-ass cliques full of Boy George's 
 They hate the team 'cause the yard full of Rolls Royce's 
 Niggas try, ain't no stoppin' us, I fried 'em like Taloppia 
 I'm mafia, talkin' to my German in the boxster 
 President dinner bitch, a grand for the lobster 
 A grand for the oysters, stuffed clam and bosperch 
 Bitch I had 'tennas way before they had apollo search 
 (???) 'For Igna man and star search 
 I called Kurt, found out I can rap and let 'em all hurt 
 Several years later I'm the nigga in the tall vert 
 Section A killer man all I need is yard work 
 Hard work, flatland Adam-ville, dog work 
 Betcha ran to see me 'cause my Chevy look like Starburst 
 Get ya feelings 'n' all hurt, wait till ya see the fall vert
