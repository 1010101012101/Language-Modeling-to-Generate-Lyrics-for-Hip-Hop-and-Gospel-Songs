 Fat bank-roll like jasper

 God please make it all freeze I believe in disaster 
 Jesus is after 
 Self-preservation is first 
 Tell kids education is first 
 Sellin dope is only makin' is worst 
 Niggas play wit da work, get shot then lay in a hurst 
 Prayin' at birth

 Fully auto semi and a fifth a bottle remy 
 Ridin' down deihl on skinnies 
 Sittin' on 26 inches in my fruit punch linen 
 Duponts spinnin

 Imma tell 'em all how it happened 
 From summerhill to kimney court 
 With no got damn cappin

 Sunshine: 
 Twenty-five grand on the wrist 
 If I was a nigga y'all bitches would be on my dick 
 Chocolate covered pumps from berlin 
 Yeah sunshine take trips 
 You like how them seven jeans grip my hips 
 I'm lookin' all sassy when I like my lips 
 When I see these tricks 
 My pockets stay fat with a grip 
 Cameras stay flashin 
 I look then I pose with a tilt 
 Y'all can't do it like me I'm fly 
 Gotta drop the top like whenever I ride 
 I get by with my homie on the side 
 X-t-a-c-i- no lie 
 Young dro 
 Big bro yeah we get dough 
 100 yard dash fake niggas got to go 
 Only real bitches feel me at the show 
 Fiendin for that x and imma give'em a lil more

 If ya wanna holla then you gotta be the shit nigga 
 Fuck it tho they callin overseas

 Dro: 
 You know how tried me it's the principle 
 I am so difficult 
 My life is irresistible 
 They judge me in municiple 
 State court lawyers make drug cases fixable 
 Million dollas every year, grand hustle 
 Benz coupe sixable 
 Now models are kissable 
 Diamonds are wristable 
 The finger on my wrist is blue 
 I'm the only nigga that a bunch of people listen too 
 They tell me that I'm lyrical 
 I promise 'em a miracle 
 Spiritual 
 Even though my conditions are critical 
 Double length scereble 
 But god man I'm hearable 
 Lord I am fearable 
 I'm hard but I'm terrible 
 Ss impala ride out veerable 
 Wood grain steering wheel 
 The porshe truck is tear blue 
 Pop krystal like you niggas pop a beer or 2to 
 Shots to ya crib queer and ain't nobody hearin you 
 Young dro perry homes nigga we ain't fearin you 
 Yo, see you know we gettin' rich anyway nigga so you better sit back and watch this shit 
 Young dro ya 
 You see me on the block you see me walkin' the blocks aye 
 (We gettin' rich nigga!)
