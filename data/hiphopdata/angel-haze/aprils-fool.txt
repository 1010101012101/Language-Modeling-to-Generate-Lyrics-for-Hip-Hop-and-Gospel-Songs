Dead skin on the flesh of your halo 
 Drunk love on the breath of an angel 
 Time frozen and the ash from your blunt 
 And you breath like you had life trapped in your lungs 
 And you wanted escape and I 
 Wanted to take every thought from your mind and just throw it away 
 As I watered, you've grown as a flower, your soul 
 You would see that I planted with the thought of a rose 
 And I thought I'd impose if I ever had the energy 
 And now I'll save somebody if I ever had the memory 
 I cleared up some space and invited you in 
 You were brown and I tried to make you violet again 
 And I brought out the sun and the violence of wind 
 And I tore off your thorns and they died in my skin 
 Yeah, and I watched you become beautiful, 
 Its funny what the dirt does when its suitable, 
 I don't mind being April's fools 
 The flowers came when the rain made you 
 Honest hours have been spent with you 
 But I'll be April's fools for you, eh, 
 And a rose grew from the concrete with a heartbeat, 
 And I took it to the grass and made its bed, 
 Then I bathed it with my love until it sprouted 
 And I'll never get the thought out if my head 
 Yo, freeze frame cause the view was so cinematic 
 And the opening to you was so hemorogic 
 But my first mistake was thinking it was easy, 
 And that you loved me if I really let you see me 
 Deep thoughts in the abyss of your brain cells 
 One shot to whatever your pains held 
 And it became something I've never seen before 
 And now my hearts too smart to be for anything but sure 
 Thought my perceptions senses varying your shade change 
 And the burdons getting heavier then weight gain 
 And we kept swallowing the sun until the shade came 
 And kept on knocking on the clouds until the rain came 
 All the flowers in the garden share the same range 
 And a rose by any colour share the same name 
 But I love you in a way that will not seise, 
 'Cause you're hideous in ways I cannot see 
 I don't mind being April's fools 
 The flowers came when the rain made you 
 Honest hours have been spent with you 
 But I'll be April's fools for you, eh, 
 If we take the flowers and walk into the rainbow 
 Remember to water them and watch how quickly they grow 
 But its quick as clouds come in and drown them in the rain so 
 We can take the potters hand and hold them with the same hold? 
 And a rose grew from the concrete with a heartbeat, 
 And I took it to the grass and made its bed, 
 Then I bathed it with my love until it sprouted 
 And I'll never get the thought out if my head
