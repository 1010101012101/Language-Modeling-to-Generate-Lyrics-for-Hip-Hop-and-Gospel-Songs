All right 
 Now everybody wanna know the truth about a nigga named Game 
 I come from the hub and every ghetto ain't the same 
 A lot of people already know exactly where it's at 
 'Cause it's the home of the jackers and the crack [whispered] - Compton 
 Yeah that's the name of my hometown 
 I'm going down, in the town, where my name is all around 
 And niggaz just be hating and shit, that's a pity 
 But I ain't doing nutting but claiming my city 
 See my lyrics are double or nothing proving to suckers I can throw 'em 
 Pass the natural 10 to 4 and six-eight before I go 
 Not really into free styling, or trying to promote violence 
 But they gotta know about the five-five-four, so 
 And that's how I'm living, I do as I please B 
 A young gangster put in work on these Cali streets 
 And everybody knows that you gotta be stomping 
 If you're born and raised in Compton 
 Quiet scratching: 
 "Born and raised in Compton" 
 Now Compton is a place, where all my niggaz chill dog 
 Till I found out, the streets get real dog 
 'Bout a year ago, somebody must of wanted me to die 
 'Cause they kicked in the door, and gave the young kid five 
 They must of thought that I was gonna' play the bitch role 
 'Cause I lived through four five six holes 
 But I ain't going out like no faggot-ass clown 
 They found, they couldn't keep a gangster nigga down 
 So here's the burner in your face motherfucker silly sucker 
 Ass clucker now you're ducking cause you can't stop a Y.G. 
 Gangster, 'cause I'm true to my game 
 You're lame, and things ain't gonna never be the same 
 Cause a nigga like the Game is taking over 
 I really don't think I should have to explain 
 Oh yeah I'm a dog but my name ain't Rover 
 And I'm the kinda nigga that's feeling no pain 
 Sometimes I have to wear a bulletproof vest 
 Because I got the C-P-T style written across my chest 
 A gangster motherfucker never ceasing to impress 
 My name is young Game so you can fuck, the rest 
 I'm coming like this and I'm coming directly 
 Cause niggaz getting all stirred up, I'm doing damage quite effectively 
 Rhyming is a battle zone and niggaz can't win 
 'Cause I'm a gangster from the C-O-M-P-T-O-N
