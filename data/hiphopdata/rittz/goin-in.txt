They say krill white boy when the sound strange 
 Don't secure we been on 'em gotta hide my chain 
 A lot of rappers crying never seen the dime that came 
 But maybe some of these babies need a diaper change 
 The driver talk about hiding your plane 
 But I don't care though 
 Flyer than a jet not a lot of ass though 
 'Cause I'm Jeremy Scott I bet you wish you had a pair hoe 
 Try to hid a lick I leave you strippin' in a scarecrow 
 Pills pop up like a varicose veins 
 Strange peace singing from the franco chain 
 That's a life you knew come and scare the proof 
 I'm just other just made fun of no way hosay 
 Got surprise and a fan base get fame 
 When I'm tryin' on a part you move a hand shake 
 Can't wait till my album drop 
 I'ma cop the money call a super sport tic tac 
 And a mansion with a man cage 
 Hopping up trees like a landscape 
 Blowing up plans 
 Motherfuckers wanna copy me like photo prints 
 I ain't chased I'm on record deal with no events 
 Show money on the road again going grands 
 Hoping friends coming from around those in France 
 Like these groupies showing skin they expose them self 
 I got a competition over with 
 Swinging when I heard the open bell 
 The KO, the kill it's like 
 Just when you thought that you seen it all 
 Like I'm out of nowhere and beating all 
 Chain chongs nigga ass black bean in all 
 You know the word bitch sing along the shit goes like this 
 Bitch take cover I'm goin' in 
 Bitch take cover I'm goin' in 
 Better take cover I'm goin' in 
 Fuck all here we go again 
 Just when you thought that you seen it all 
 Like I'm out of nowhere and beating all 
 Chain chongs nigga ass black bean in all 
 You know the word bitch sing along the shit goes like this 
 Bitch take cover I'm goin' in 
 Bitch take cover I'm goin' in 
 Better take cover I'm goin' in 
 Fuck all here we go again 
 Some set with the mindset head 
 'Cause I just set a record deal 
 When the pain is too monogamy 
 In 2013 I was going up and up to revive it 
 These motherfuckers flipping out see I'm wide awake 
 I got myself on the web like a spider egg 
 I was already hot as buffers like a finder place 
 The bitches wouldn't give me the of time of day 
 Tryin' to bathe for a dick better than a wiper blade 
 It's rape when I stick it in 'em 
 Smack so big I fit 'em and mind them 
 Sippin' great goose straight with the hittin' lemon 
 Balls on the street getting bigger bet you wish you had a similar lemon 
 Or side rubbers in 'em see fields down the Indian trail 
 Wheat grain and suspenders hell 
 I'm like chemical spill I'm a seed 
 I'm toxic on that white boy shit 
 Slow American minds then we slap chicks 
 Bat unto your girl until you're a straight hoe 
 Raise it at the bar fuck a tab I don't pay for 
 6 deep and the super 8 on the same floor 
 Geek crushing on speed beat with the triple 8 car 
 Another 8 ball came when I came and called my name 
 In the place I made breakin' in the game claw 
 This ain't the game and I ain't been asleep yet 
 Let the games begin it's like 
 Just when you thought that you seen it all 
 Like I'm out of nowhere and beating all 
 Chain chongs nigga ass black bean in all 
 You know the word bitch sing along the shit goes like this 
 Bitch take cover I'm goin' in 
 Bitch take cover I'm goin' in 
 Better take cover I'm goin' in 
 Fuck all here we go again 
 Just when you thought that you seen it all 
 Like I'm out of nowhere and beating all 
 Chain chongs nigga ass black bean in all 
 You know the word bitch sing along the shit goes like this 
 Bitch take cover I'm goin' in 
 Bitch take cover I'm goin' in 
 Better take cover I'm goin' in 
 Fuck all here we go again 
 I did it I'm guilty, my lyrics are filthy 
 I'm the rapper these fat bitches ask about 
 Should've asked around before you fuck with me 
 Now turn your ass around we're going ass to mouth 
 We're doing mass amounts of coke 
 Bitch you thought I was slanging 
 All the beamers were cashing out 
 You wanna sniff some 
 Get my dick soft by your own bitch 
 And a Taylor Swift song when they get you pissed on 
 It's fiction you can't believe every single word you hear in the record 
 We just be rhymers to a dumby you a mummy 
 You ain't feeling me you're dead or you a zombie 
 Sip amount when you rather talk about me I'm naughty 
 But you choosing to balati 
 You bleed and you meditate 
 Watch the history channel you really think 
 These rappers are part of some secret society 
 You probably think that David Blaine levitates 
 Probably think I'm hooked on meth I can't quit my habit 
 Ri ri ri ricks in this bitch spaghetti 
 But they get another victim that shit is tragic 
 My dad's a maniac too so I figure it's genetics 
 The waiting the grabbing shit is just pathetic 
 You startle me and you gon' fuck around and get me a headache 
 On the stage butt naked butt drop on my dick 
 Saying a nigga wanna suck a nick 
 Can grab it and 
 Just when you thought that you seen it all 
 Like I'm out of nowhere and beating all 
 Chain chongs nigga ass black bean in all 
 You know the word bitch sing along the shit goes like this 
 Bitch take cover I'm goin' in 
 Bitch take cover I'm goin' in 
 Better take cover I'm goin' in 
 Fuck all here we go again 
 Just when you thought that you seen it all 
 Like I'm out of nowhere and beating all 
 Chain chongs nigga ass black bean in all 
 You know the word bitch sing along the shit goes like this 
 Bitch take cover I'm goin' in 
 Bitch take cover I'm goin' in 
 Better take cover I'm goin' in 
 Fuck all here we go again
