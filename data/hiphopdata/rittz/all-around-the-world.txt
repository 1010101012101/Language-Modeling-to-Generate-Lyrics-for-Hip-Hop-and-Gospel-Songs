All around the world 
 All around the world 
 I'm just a kid from the JC 
 Who would've thought you would see me 
 On MTV one day and I came along 
 Wait from Britain on CD 
 Up in the bass mic on cruise roll 
 Used to do shows with no cameras there 
 I'm doing shit on the house of blues 
 And they'll lay on stage a whole crowd be cheering me on 
 Disappear when we on 
 Up in the tour bus on to the next state 
 The last one was eleven weeks long 
 Friends saying you made it risk 
 You don't play the shit 
 Eating dry egg stakes on a Vegas trip 
 Die hard fans would be showing up 
 Like "hey would you please sign my ladies hits?" 
 I'm like, fine 
 You can touch Rittz I don't mind 
 I say congratulations on your latest hit 
 You got big stone put them online 
 'Cause girl might drip out 
 Me and her we done had a hard time 
 7 years we ain't never had a dime 
 Eventhough it ain't much it feel like getting ditch now 
 I just signed a deal so I'ma get it now 
 I told Tech to travel won't let him down 
 It's an honor to be a part of strange music 
 A label this time I go the extra mile 
 And I could crack a smile without faking it 
 'Cause a few people knew me get an A 
 Now I got dudes over in the UK 
 Getting tattoos of my face they know me 
 All around the world 
 All around the world 
 They know me all around the world 
 All around the world 
 One time the homies in Toronto 
 Fans that feel me in Montreal 
 2 years ago if it wasn't for no bag dog 
 I'd probably wouldn't have no luck at all 
 Had to try my card and do spot days 
 On a piece of junk I stall and I'ma rude the call 
 Shit overheard in this Hennessy 
 Hundred degree and we stranded but we'll be falls 
 I'm like no, 
 Danny Boom, Dean Jones 
 Help niggas paying my fan base 
 When I was dead broke they would throw me some cheese for shows 
 That's real 
 We done stayed in some shitty hotels 
 Sleeping on top but it comes in wearing socks 
 And we should not know and the shit would go ill 
 On stage on the country raw but nobody knew me 
 Openin' for rehab again 
 If I must let the opposite of line 
 Cheap Jynx have one make a mac with it 
 Across country fans like I knew it's just a come see 
 Me and my own I ain't had nobody fond me 
 3 star hotel used to be a luxury 
 Now we're getting kicked out of this reppin' 
 Smoking weed, drinking crown 
 Celebrating we in town 
 Cars would take us to the after party 
 Weird I was begging for my pick and out 
 And I'm blessed but now I gotta go and get more 
 I was just a kid and we're here with a dream 
 Gotta be like Dre and big boy 
 Now they know 
 All around the world 
 All around the world 
 They know me all around the world 
 All around the world 
 Third verse I'ma dedicate to my homies 
 Slick boy, chico, freaky freeze 
 Warrup Ralo, trans ain't held me down 
 But thank God they believed in me 
 My boys mandatory Irish nut 
 We hit a motherfucker if we start the but 
 Shortcut name Rittz and kids named me white Jesus 
 Look what you started bro that's love 
 Dallas had finally came on 
 For the days and back and I ain't grade for the football 
 Game trying to sell my own thoughts 
 And my friends I miss 
 Growing up and we had to part ways 
 We was young we set on chain 
 But we still climb a tail homies we on both ways 
 Used to my rap friends but all vulnerable 
 They would get to live our dreams 
 They told me the town is valuable 
 But truthfully town niggas everything, it's unfair 
 That's why I gotta thank my fans 
 I could be the best rapper alive without them nobody really give a damn 
 All around the world 
 All around the world 
 They know me all around the world 
 All around the world
