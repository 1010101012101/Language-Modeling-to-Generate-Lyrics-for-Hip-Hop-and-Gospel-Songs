Dear Lord, thank you for letting me be here to see another day again 
 I'm grateful to be alive, God bless the souls that came in with I'm so lucky 
 To have a good family that loves me 
 Please let my girl know how much I love her 
 Sorry that we're both so unhealthy 
 I feel so guilty 
 Every time I pray I feel like I ask her to help me 
 I don't pray with the hopes to get wealthy 
 I just want success I know it sounds selfish 
 I thought I'm gonna screw her 
 I finally had the chance to fix it 
 I signed a record deal all these years 
 I wish I was more optimistic, 
 I'm really just scared 
 What if they don't like what they hear 
 What if I don't make a career out of music 
 What am I supposed to do then 
 I'm always getting jobs 
 I hate to see my face in the mirror 
 And I wrote about everything so many times 
 I don't have inspiration to spare 
 I barely even hear 
 I've been down on the road 
 And I feel like I've been gone all year 
 Even when I'm home there's so much pressure to be here 
 It's hard to feel like I'm all there 
 So many wish they could rest for a living 
 So complain about us it's unfair 
 Some days I feel like I've been living in a dream 
 Other times feeling like a nightmare 
 And I need some of my peers 
 'Cause I have a bunch of songs to write 
 And I feel like my future depends on this 
 Gotta rid myself of mirror plus these hand chips 
 Gotta get some confidence up in my paymentship 
 And I wanna disappoint the fans who listenin' 
 'Cause they expectin' something incredible in the end 
 But that pain I'm nothing as I regain to get my strive back 
 I'ma went with them when I was a kid 
 When I was a kid my dad just play the guitar 
 Me and my brother would pretend that we was in a band 
 Musicians in my family dream to be stars 
 Only to condensate something that you didn't attend my music 
 Must've been playing the chosen one 
 So I'ma go tripping and go behind this sniper rock 
 Amen, song never came 
 Strange music
