Fuck the rookie of the year bitch I'm a future hall of famer 
 You can see I came up 
 Long time coming from a dude who never gave up 
 You know another rapper comin' hard as me then name one 
 Talk a lot of shit about me, I don't entertain em 
 Bang em, fuck hoes used to ball and chain em 
 The groupie at the show that blew me, you would probably claim her 
 Put the pimpin' on the bitch you suckers oughta tame her 
 Blame me 'cause I turned her out she used to be an angel 
 Stranger, but canned a strange music new addition 
 Fans told me to kill it I'mma do what you insisted 
 Real shit don't gotta separate the true from fiction 
 Famous tee and Levis we ain't got the true religion 
 Coming out the super system on some slum shit 
 Unfit for your kids to listen to a dumbie with a young bitch 
 Eating mushrooms on a tool deck long 
 Trip is on off a molly cups same kiss 
 Come sip on meth, on coke 
 Crush it with the credit card 
 Or the room key used to get inside the travel lodge 
 Camouflage, Jimmy Scott's in the Chevy Avalanche 
 Fantasize about the life of it 'cause I'm an enterprise 
 Fuck a bitch and when I finish tell the bitch no mas 
 Adios! and I know you wanna party ho 
 But I got a lot of dough I'm trying to get 
 I'm runnin' circles round these rappers tell 'em catch up on they cardio 
 About to blow damn right, steppin' on a land mine 
 We can throw them hands I'm never scared of combat 
 Representing in a A-Town skullcap 
 I ain't from the country bitch mother fuck a straw hat 
 We ain't ridin' skateboards we be rocking all black 
 Thinking that it's all good, find out that it's all bad 
 Stick you up and run off with the shit y'all have 
 Nerve of these guys, we ain't giving y'all dap 
 Please you ain't like us, we ain't like them 
 And if you listen close enough than you can be like I am 
 You can be like I am, you can be like I am 
 Shit you ain't like us, we ain't like them 
 And if you listen close enough than you can be like I am 
 You can be like I am, you can be like I am, yeah 
 You can be like I am 
 You can be like I am 
 You can be like I am 
 You can be like I am 
 See y'all be on some trash shit, I be tryin' to smell good 
 Burberry rich bitch sniffing and I smell blood 
 I be like a predator, the only thing I fear is God 
 Still y'all judging me because of my appearance 
 You got a lot of nerves everything I hear sucks 
 Even if I was using a pair of ear plugs 
 Rappers looking like some lying lames trying to me trying hard 
 Posing like they taking pictures for the year book 
 Rowdy like a white kid who got a beer buzz 
 We ain't on no miller note only ground nigga missile hope 
 Put us in the four bitch no motel 6 hotel and they go 
 Me and you are the opposite of identical 
 You just cocky I'm confident I'm an animal 
 And I plan to go far with this rap shit 
 You the type of dude to quit and give up on 'em like Deangelo 
 Cameltoe pussy boy, gangsta on the internet 
 That's why I don't respond to people coming ignorant 
 This world small fuck a gun cause a punch in the mouth 
 Will put a stop on people trippin' on this twitter shit 
 I ain't even trippin' no with the whole eating raw 
 Oysters on a half shell dripping in a mayonette 
 On a saltine double I was called seeing shit 
 Now walk inside the booth and I be spinning heads fire engine red 
 Leather coat coat, trend setter flow flow 
 Feelin' good because I got a couple grand to blow blow 
 No hope pull the horses on a go go 
 They try to keep me up and get us in the no go, go go 
 Stick bitches still jump a dick 
 'Cause my buzz getting bigger by the tickin' of the second hand 
 Make your wife try to hide her wedding band 
 Make your life pathetic man, them and they ain't never staying 
 Please you ain't like us, we ain't like them 
 And if you listen close enough than you can be like I am 
 You can be like I am, you can be like I am 
 Shit you ain't like us, we ain't like them 
 And if you listen close enough than you can be like I am 
 You can be like I am, you can be like I am, yeah 
 You can be like I am 
 You can be like I am 
 You can be like I am 
 You can be like I am
