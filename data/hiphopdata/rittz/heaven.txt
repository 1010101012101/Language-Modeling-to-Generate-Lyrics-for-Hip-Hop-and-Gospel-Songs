Have you ever been to outer space 
 Tour bus living like a balisaur 
 Over no counter space 
 Evaluate the life but the future's hard to calculate 
 Can't stop but you gotta look at everybody putting on a smiley face 
 Have you seen a sunshine in the cloudy day 
 You light the over cash you really hope with that 
 Could you light the darkness that comforts you 
 Like a compass do 
 Buzzer 'em like you just flew up the zoo 
 Higher than a middle school kid up on glue 
 Sucking really on mouth from dark alone 
 Fix faith the rub sticks we start the fight 
 Knowing that the real shit is coming soon 
 You could wind a song or two I heard it backwards 
 Wishing close my eyes and saw the blackbirds 
 Eating on a dead raccoon 
 Starting to think I'm bad when I was scared to say bad words 
 And for the internet making up Facebook passwords 
 I see Casper slow in my room 
 When I pray I guess she come down and bring f words 
 People kill deal for the ant lords 
 I didn't really wanna pet one 
 I didn't really wanna let one live 
 Or some futuristic shit like the Jetsons 
 Yes man floating on my home boy, step on 
 Fitting to my pops all that 'cause a lecture 
 Take a step and I drip in the death of my headphone 
 Singing on the floor in the restroom get some 
 Looking at the world with my eye lids shut 
 We give it all to live but when we die then what 
 My eyes electrifying like the lightning struck 
 I look up in the sky and hope that I get up 
 In heaven, heaven 
 Looking at the world with my eye lids shut 
 We give it all to live but when we die then what 
 My eyes electrifying like the lightning struck 
 I look up in the sky and hope that I get up 
 In heaven, heaven 
 Hey pass me the squigy (Somebody do up) 
 I'm sick in New Port doing coke (In my bus) 
 In New Port doing coke but (You are so far) 
 You done brought 2 hoes backstage (That shit ain't goal) 
 You told me 3 hoes was deal 
 'Cause they were (headbanging) 
 Or you could be certain that the meat curve (Was hanging) 
 Hey let me get another shot of jack (Fuck yeah!) 
 What?! oh you drank it all (Fuck yeah!) 
 Fuck it where's the Canadian mist 
 Now I'm on some plastic bottle drinking shit 
 And my tour manager's looking for somewhere to sink his dick (Brooklyn) 
 Represent, represent sent, trap call myth, represent, represent sent 
 The bottle ain't girl for queen queen 
 Somebody ways to swim badadduuu duduuu 
 And I mean that from the bottom of my nuts 
 3 more shots I moonshine I do fine 
 Looking at the world with my eye lids shut 
 We give it all to live but when we die then what 
 My eyes electrifying like the lightning struck 
 I look up in the sky and hope that I get up 
 In heaven, heaven 
 Looking at the world with my eye lids shut 
 We give it all to live but when we die then what 
 My eyes electrifying like the lightning struck 
 I look up in the sky and hope that I get up 
 In heaven, heaven
