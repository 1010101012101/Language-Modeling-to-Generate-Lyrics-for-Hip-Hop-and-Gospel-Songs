Smoking weed and staying high 
 Partying till late at night 
 'Cause all we do is drink 
 And all we do is smoke 
 And all were doing is wastin' time 
 High school drop out chapter one 
 On the way to school smoking master blunts 
 My mom was at work my dad was gone 
 It felt wrong after the first period we run 
 Inside the woods back of burtmont high I'm 29 
 Skipping school made the winter feel like summertime 
 Getting U's in every class but fuck if I don't pass 
 I don't plan to graduate I really wanna rhyme 
 In my cutlass I'm 16 meek leans 
 And I vow on rapper shit 
 Call my mom at work and told her fuck high school 
 I ain't never going back I quit 
 She cried her eyes out all I did was laugh and click 
 Hung up on her what a dick like looking back at it 
 That was the last thing she need 
 She would cry herself to sleep every night 
 'Cause my dad just left for shit 
 Maybe this a reason for rebellion 
 Maybe it's the reason I'm inhaling, stealing 
 Doing gas runs, breaking in the vacuum cleaners 
 Driving stolen cars like a hellion 
 Smoke another L then trying to act wrong 
 But we was just children, snorting coke, taking acid 
 Another shotgun to the nose 10 years in a row 
 High on a bunch, times racing past us 
 Smoking weed day and night 
 Partying till late in night 
 'Cause all we do is drink 
 All we do is smoke 
 All were doing is wastin' time 
 I know I need to change my life 
 But it's hard for me to say goodnight 
 'Cause all we do is drink 
 All we do is smoke 
 All were doing is wastin' time 
 Kids my age done graduate in college 
 Some married some have some kids 
 Most of them have credit cards and cars 
 Or large houses, me I'm on that rapper shit 
 Which means I don't got a job 
 I just have a couple hundred dollars 
 And a sack and a pack of cigs 
 Still smoke with the crew but it ain't fun like it used to be 
 We got high, we don't laugh, we bitch about 
 Shit we don't got funny enough 
 Some homie always got money for drugs 
 Getting too old to be running cops 
 Expired tags drunk driving with a gun in the glove 
 With no permit turned into a drug addict 
 Yesterday my dad called and he said that I concerned him 
 'Cause I'm pale and I'm frail 
 When I sitting inside my house with my girlfriend like a hermit 
 Hurry pull the curtain 
 Working dead end jobs part time for the extra cash 
 But it never lasts, and I never had 
 Any backup plan, broke, running from a driver of a checkered cab 
 I need to catch a nap but not enough 
 For 3 days don 't mess with my so called better half 
 Oath to the 05 was a blur occurred to me one night 
 I was in the lab 
 Smoking weed day and night 
 Partying till late in night 
 'Cause all we do is drink 
 All we do is smoke 
 All were doing is wastin' time 
 I know I need to change my life 
 But it's hard for me to say goodbye 
 'Cause all we do is drink 
 All we do is smoke 
 All were doing is wastin' time 
 Well I was wastin time while I was pacing around 
 With that MD20/20 
 Rap game ain't paying my pockets ain't banging, my fridge is left still empty 
 Ribs are stickin, my mouth is dry, looking for another couch to occupy 
 Mama like come on baby maybe this ain't for you 
 Give another 9 to 5 a try 
 But I rather sell bootleg movies out of my partner's hooptie 
 Bang my music, roll a doobie 
 Sip some lean, hit the strip 
 Bang a bitch that probably average 
 But when she pops a pill she's a savage 
 And I was half lit when I smashed it 
 Woke up at 2 with an eighth 
 Think I'm losing my faith, good Lord ain't have shit 
 Eviction notice fuck being focused 
 I'm overdosin' on Jim Beam 
 Black out then I come to 
 Like what we sipping on, who got the green 
 'Cause I need it 
 1.55 so can whip that and I eat it 
 It's a blessing I'm still breathing 
 'Cause I was 
 Smoking weed day and night 
 Partyin' till late in night 
 'Cause all we do is drink 
 All we do is smoke 
 All were doing is wastin' time 
 I know I need to change my life 
 But it's hard for me to say goodnight 
 'Cause all we do is drink 
 All we do is smoke 
 All were doing is wastin' time
