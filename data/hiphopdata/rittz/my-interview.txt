So tell me, who is Rittz? 
 That's a stupid question 
 Bitch, Rittz is me 
 A white boy from windy county Georgia 
 Been doing for some years never gave up 
 Now I get to live my dream 
 And, when did you start to rap? 
 I think I started to rap back in '92 
 I got to rhyme with Snoop 
 Or some dude that I rode the bus with 
 Tried to get the boys for me when I went to school 
 So, how'd your family act? 
 About the fact of rap they used to hate it 
 Instead I was actin' blat, pull your pants up boy 
 Mom and dad would snap 
 I had to grab Uncle Jack with the hat to match 
 Would you make good grades? 
 Hell no I been flown 
 Seventh grade eighth grade ninth grade enough 
 I got still from selling weed and never came back 
 Everyday it would check my book bag for drugs 
 Where did you get the name Rittz from? 
 That's another dumb question 
 Are you a dumb bitch? 
 It's obvious that I got the name after the crack 
 Because I'm white, please next subject 
 You got an attitude honey? 
 I apologize 
 Plus I'm a little drunk and I'm always tired 
 I don't answer these questions a thousand times 
 And please still don't know my name and I'm a God, it's like 
 Everybody's asking all this shit about me 
 Wondering where I came from 
 Questioning my surroundings 
 And the same motherfuckers that damned me 
 Bitter haters that used to down me 
 And I'm trying to answer their questions but my memories just too cloudy for 
 My interview 
 (What's your name? Rittz bitch, where you from? G-A getting fucked up for)

 Was it hard to come here in Atlanta? 
 Ye kinda soft 
 If you need this type of shit the players have to claw 
 And these strippers don't dance and the radio don't play 
 And besides showing no signs of law 
 God damn right 
 There's a ton of us to represent so hard 
 Don't let the worse off burn you off 
 How people moved in get their hair blown off 
 I heard you rap about drugs a lot 
 You probably would too if you grew up on a shed of sea 
 16 I was with the things, the shit changed in '96 the left came 
 What you mean? 
 Everybody getting mama get their JC 
 Try and home invasions on robbers week 
 Kept running from the JCPD 
 'Cause the crime rate kept increasing weekly 
 But is that a set you could you rhyme about? 
 Fuck yes so many nights been spending in my mama's house 
 Geeked up and all scared that I might be thinking I'm die trying to ride tonight 
 But to change the subject, what's up with your hair 
 God damn why do people care 
 Got raw man coming under me when it's something like 
 Please say you didn't cut her this affair 
 And I swear it's like 
 Everybody's asking all this shit about me 
 Wondering where I came from 
 Questioning my surroundings 
 And the same motherfuckers that damned me 
 Bitter haters that used to down me 
 And I'm trying to answer their questions but my memories just too cloudy for

 So Yelawolf discovered you, right? 
 He said if he ever got the chance he would put me on 
 And when he blew it in, I owe him everything 
 So if anybody fuck with my dude again 
 So is it still American? 
 Of course it is 
 Warrup shawty fat warrup stroll 
 Warrup new port, warrup wim 
 I'm about to kill shit 
 Can't nobody stop us dog 
 What do you say to those who say you rap too fast? 
 Don't listen to the view that are ready to rhyme 
 They cost you nothin' pending no mind 
 Old soap both fuck a little linen a lot 
 You gettin' money now, right? 
 I came October off 20 grand 
 I put it down pay down my new carpet 
 My manager's off now I got like 16 
 I go out of town again 
 How'd your girlfriend dealing with your new success 
 When I'm gone on the road all she does is cry 
 And the dudes she would cheat and is sleeping with her 
 When I'm using and chilling getting drunk and high 
 Last question, do you think the world is ready for a fat long hair bitch shit like you? 
 Fuck yeah bitch indeed I do, and I guess I gotta make you a believer too, it's like 
 Everybody's asking all this shit about me 
 Wondering where I came from 
 Questioning my surroundings 
 And the same motherfuckers that damned me 
 Bitter haters that used to down me
