We kept hustlin 
 We kept grindin 
 (Violent J) 
 The overwhelming workload that it takes 
 The shakin' off snakes 
 The pains and the aches 
 Wrong moves and mistakes 
 They disrupt, corrupt and distract you from your mission 
 And all those who let go and spend their lives wishin and missin' 
 I couldn't listen in school, I felt I had a different callin 
 But all everybody did was roll their eyes and start yawnin 
 But this is real life and only you is livin' through your eyes 
 There are dreamers, those who want it 
 And us, who won't be denied 
 It's a struggle every day, success is far from fuckin' free 
 Unless you plucked it from a tree, with J and ICP 
 Shaggy 2 Dope and Violent J Refuse to Lose! 
 Livin' proof do what you got and you can do what you choose 
 (Shaggy 2 Dope) 
 Hate to sit back on this track like a little bitch and remininsce <<<< 
 But instead I'll kick a little history all about the hatchet 
 By this time in the game, most motherfuckers fell apart 
 In these years we still shinin and we now just gettin' our start 
 Inner City Posse jumped on the scene and we was mad crewed up 
 In the end when shit got rough it was just the two of us 
 When you was in the club gettin' ya grind and ya sip on 
 We was in the parkin lot gettin' our flyers on 
 Did my first show when I was sixteen 
 It's still part of my scheme 
 J holdin' out a drive-through window at Burger King to support our dreams 
 It seemed like yesterday, the world wasn't ready for two clown freaks 
 But we kept grindin 
 Now who on whose dick, lil Bitch shit 
 We kept hustlin 
 We kept grindin 
 (Monoxide Child) 
 I woke up in the morning with my head on backwords 
 Went from street livin' to an underground master 
 Went from sellin baggies in allies to sellin from here to Cali 
 And rollin' with the Psychopathic family 
 I started up with Krazees hooked up with Violent J 
 The rest is still bein written like a biography 
 Don't think you know my story, cause there's too much to tell 
 Just know that I've been underground and I've been doin' well 
 Since the days of makin' tapes in the basement 
 We came a long way, I'd like to see you do the same shit 
 Monoxide, and I'm Twiztid with a Z 
 Carnival representin' till I D-I-E 
 (Madrox) 
 We met ICP way back, touring once or twice 
 They was real cool, Felt like we known 'em all our life 
 They said You ever wanna side with them 
 We was like hell yeah we down the ground with friends 
 They put us out, this was way before the family era 
 When we toured for three years with a t-shirt 
 Gettin' mixed response from the bleachers and show-goers 
 Prepared for rock-throwers and flame-throwers we stayed focused 
 In '98 we dropped our first LP 
 Psychopathic presentin' Twiztid Mostasteless the CD 
 Go out and get it bitch, shit is cold as ice 
 So dope that we released it twice 
 And we still here 
 We kept hustlin 
 We kept grindin 
 (Blaze Ya Dead Homie) 
 It started as a guest, I moved later to a real spot 
 Worked behind the scenes before I really got a shot 
 In the studio, twistin still need jsdflkjlk;jsdflkdfjdf 
 My skills got me the deal off the CD you know it's dope 
 But it was on now in '99, the first GOTJ 
 Ya Dead Homie Blaze and ABK rippin the stage 
 The first time I ever got to grind in the sunshine 
 Six minutes shorter the EP's full play time 
 Still confusin some, give love for One Less G 
 That's when we moved to the streets and people started hearin me 
 From Colton Grundy to Clockwork Grey my skills increased 
 Don't believe me? Pick up my next CD 
 (Anybody Killa) 
 I keep it grindin like an old set of car brakes 
 Started off with a duel player and cassette tapes 
 By '95 my life was frustrated so I developed my mentals and let the funk recreate it 
 And then I hit the stage with my homie Blaze thuggin' for life 
 City to city tours under the light 
 Straight outta Detroit grindin Warrior baby 
 I ain't never gonna stop, my heat's never on safety 
 This is Psychopathic bitch boy and we so sweet 
 What you know about the label runnin' under the streets? 
 This be Anybody Killa homie, like me or not 
 Over a hundred thousand sold bitch with one bout to drop 
 For real 
 We kept hustlin 
 We kept grindin 
 (Bonez Dubb) 
 Mothafuckas don't trip I'm one of the youngest homies on the 
 And keepin' it grindin with a 
 And on my way to the fuckin' top 
 Because we underneath the surface be prepared to be real hurt bitch 
 We came from the gutter and now I'm fuckin' your mother and workin it 
 I know I'm only 24 up in this hoe but check it yo 
 I was smokin' it before some of y'all was even startin to grow 
 Some of y'all don't even know 
 So many shows by eighteen 
 And by my twenty-first I was on the national scene 
 And see, been given an oppurtunity to speak my words and yo 
 Be keepin' it wicked and run with the hatchet for sho so slow your roll 
 My name is Bonez and this be O-T 
 We murderin fucks till the sun comes up that's why they call us A.M.B 
 (Otis) 
 Hey homie I hope you listen to my rappin' 
 Cause rappin' is all I have it's all that every fuckin' mattered 
 Your heart can get shattered your pockets can get fatter 
 Just grind like me and mine and you'll shine like my family 
 In the beginning my mission was to make it to the hatchet 
 Then I did it and started laughin' I grinded and look what happened 
 My mind is not on this planet, cause y'all thought that we vanished 
 But God's Hand got my back, and the game still gets me fuckin' mad 
 I start poppin' off at the mouth when somethin' bothers me 
 You mothafuckers better give it up for R.O.C 
 You mothafuckers better give it up for A.M.B 
 DJ Clay mixtapes, gettin' paid and makin' haters bleed 
 We kept hustlin 
 We kept grindin 
 (Boondox) 
 All the blood and the tears I spent on over the years 
 And all the time on the grind I conquered most of my fears 
 Not knowin' would I make it and was it worth the sacrifice 
 Skippin meals and skippin bills I hoped that it was worth the price 
 Of the love of my kids and would they hate me in the end 
 For all the time I didn't spend I knew I'd have to make amends 
 So kept the mike in one hand the other gripped on my glock 
 Kept one eye on the prize the other fixed up on the clock 
 It was a hustler in my heart who let me know I wouldn't fail 
 Would I end up on the stage or would I end up in a cell 
 Then one Monday afternoon I got that call from Psychopathic 
 Put the pistol in the drawer and now I'm runnin' with the hatchet [Woo Woo!] 
 We kept hustlin 
 We kept grindin 
 (DJ Clay) 
 I was sixteen young and was never put on 
 But was put down strong and when Big Rude gave me a call 
 Sayin' that the wicked clowns had a party called Big Ballas 
 And if I want to come spin and make a couple dollars 
 St. Andrew's Hall [Yeah!] Remember it all [Yeah!] 
 When I went into this game who knew I would last this long 
 Then when '06 came around you can Fuck the Fuck Off 
 It was me and Shaggy 2 Dope I was on my first tour 
 And little did I know it was the first of many more 
 Now I'm pushin out mixtapes for the juggalos 
 And the love I get from them keeps me higher than some dro 
 That's why I'm standin here, arms crossed just to let you know how we 
 We kept hustlin 
 We kept grindin
