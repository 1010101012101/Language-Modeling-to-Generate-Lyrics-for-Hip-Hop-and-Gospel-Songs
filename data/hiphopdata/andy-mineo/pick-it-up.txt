Yo 
 Even if it means carrying an anvil up a steep hill 
 During an avalanche, I wanna walk inside His will 
 These habitats and conditions is giving me the chills 
 This is not a thrill 
 And it doesn't feel like a walk in the park 
 It kinda seems like I'm walking in the dark, lantern in my heart 
 These thorns and these thistles are picking me apart 
 And cameras keep flashing, they depicting it as art-ful 
 I'm on my knees right, stains on my jeans 
 Filthy from head to toe, I finally get to see light 
 Still in the batter's box after three strikes 
 Walking like Rev Run, steppin' in my three stripes 
 Walking this way and that way, 
 I found the narrow path is like a tightrope. 
 He's gonna catch me - if I fall 
 Guess we all need a challenge, 
 To battle through this race and the Cross to balance 
 With that execution 
 Jury on your chest (pick it up) 
 And if you would look to it 
 Your soul will find some rest, pick it up 
 Oh, Pick It Up 
 Pick it up 
 Question 
 How would your face look if Jesus were to scroll through a page of your Facebook? 
 Better one, would He be a bit confused 
 If He seen His name written in your religious views 
 Feeling conviction, they ticked like "didn't you know He's love?" 
 Yeah you right, but when He come back here to judge: 
 Lamb to the Lion, He's ruling the nations 
 Packing a rod of iron, making a fool of Satan 
 Tattoo on His thigh, King of kings, Lord of lords 
 That's the name that's ascribed 
 White horses he'll ride, got flames in His eyes 
 I'm not playin' His fury is crushing enemies like grapes into wine 
 Ain't nobody know the day or the time 
 So I pray that you make up your mind, deny yourself and take up the pine 
 Live the Cross, it ain't a chain or design, 'cause sin is wack 
 Don't wear one on your chest if you don't bear one on your back, fam 
 With that execution 
 Jury on your chest 
 And if you would look to it 
 Your soul will find some rest, pick it up 
 Oh, Pick It Up 
 Pick it up 
 He want us sold out, searching our hearts 
 Even believers got sin that they keep in the dark 
 You know that one thing God ain't pleased with 
 He told you give it up, you wanna keep it 
 You got a million excuses a billion reasons 
 But at the end of the day you still ain't at peace yet 
 Well let me let you in on a secret 
 We can't go deeper in our relationship till we leave it 
 Decease it, put it to sleep like a Posturepedic 
 'Cause sin is a fatal disease and only Jesus can treat it 
 In light of the fact that He freed us, 
 By His blood cleaned us, washed and redeemed us 
 That's reason to make us rotate from our old ways 
 Desire to please and obey, tell the Lord okay 
 When the road may seem kinda lonely, my life Your way 
 Ay
