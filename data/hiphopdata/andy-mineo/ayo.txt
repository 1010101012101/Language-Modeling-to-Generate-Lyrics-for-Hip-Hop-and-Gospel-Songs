Never bored (8x) 
 Narly 
 Never bored 
 But I got a board 
 That I put on all fours 
 And kick it on smooth floors 
 It's with me on tours 
 Even ride it on stages 
 Reds in the wheels 
 But I wasn't set claiming 
 Clicked up 
 We ain't tryin' to be famous 
 People don't get it 
 They don't know just wat 
 The aim is 
 Dangerous 
 Wat you gon' say 
 It's a man who been chaaanged 
 Who know that to die is to gaaaaiin 
 Yeah! You know what it's like 
 You know what it's like 
 Getting ready for the moment 
 Getting ready for the night 
 But I'm getting ready for that moment 
 When my faith will be sight 
 What's the point of gettin' fly 
 If you ain't ready for the fliiightt, ha 
 From this life to the one that I follow 
 Dudes found bravado at the bottom of the bottle 
 Until they got they face twisted up like Picasso 
 There's another way to live 
 You ain't got to go, somebody tell em 
 Say, "Ayo" 
 Come and kick it with the team 
 The party's over here 
 Let me show you what I mean 
 We saying, "Ayo" 
 I'm on that one sixteen 
 Homie come and get it right 
 Show you what the clique like 
 "Ayo" 
 Come and kick it with the team 
 The party's over here 
 Let me show you what I mean 
 We saying, "Ayo" 
 I'm on that one sixteen 
 You can come and get it right 
 Show you what the clique like 
 Sweet 
 Kobe told me 'bout the matrix 
 Not that I'm about it 
 I don't bang with the same set that I used to clang 
 See look it I ain't famous 
 Some people know my name though 
 I just wanna remain low 
 So that that I don't take it to the brain, brain 
 Catch me on the ground on a train ridin' slow 
 That's where I compose 
 All my wickedest flows 
 Being from New York 
 Or wicked at its prose 
 And it's kind Edison's bills high like its smokin' 
 Some are up town 
 It's like an expo 
 With some expose skin 
 Like a triple x show 
 Me and my dawgs flee 
 We don't need a vet though 
 But my flesh be itchin' 
 Don't get me started 
 I'm tryna finish 
 Enjoying God's gifts 
 You know what the dish 
 Out in Barbados 
 They made us through blind fish 
 We've been all around the world 
 Me and the whole clique 
 Unashamed everywhere 
 They holla 1 1 6 
 Saying, "Ayo" 
 Come and kick it with the team 
 The party's over here 
 Let me show you what I mean 
 We saying, "Ayo" 
 I'm on that one sixteen 
 Homie come and get it right 
 Show you what the clique like 
 "Ayo" 
 Come and kick it with the team 
 The party's over here 
 Let me show you what I mean 
 We saying, "Ayo" 
 I'm on that one sixteen 
 You can come and get it right 
 Show you what that clique like
