(Verse 1 - Andy Mineo) 
 Yeah, there's so many things I wanna address 
 A cosmic issue, I'll do my best 
 These tracks are written in blood 
 We still buyin' people, slavery never left 
 There's 20+ million women and children 
 These are not numbers, they are souls that we're dealing with 
 I'm feeling sick thinking 'bout the innocent 
 Girls that got caught up on the strip making money for a pimp 
 See the game so slick, but it happens all the time 
 Before he broke her body, he had to break her mind 
 And he talkin' in her ear, all the stuff she wanted to hear 
 Stuff her daddy should've told her, but he probably wasn't there 
 She 14, bought her candy and a teddy bear 
 Bought her clothes, got her anything she wanted to wear 
 He got her nails done, told her that he loved her 
 But he said he'd love her more if she went and made him money 
 (Chorus - Co Campbell) 
 When is it all gon' change? Slavery still remains, yeah 
 Their minds, their hearts, all torn apart, yeah 
 We must remain till we see them broken chains, yeah 
 Your pain, your scars, we'll carry till your freedom is ours 
 (Verse 2 - Andy Mineo) 
 To all my fathers that ain't runnin' 
 Please tell your daughters that you love them 
 And if you don't, then somebody else will 
 Yo they need it, just to hear it they might let somebody touch them 
 And some use sex to get love 
 And some use love to get sex 
 And some use sex to get the bread that they need to pay rent 
 'Cause nobody gonna do it for the kids 
 So tell me what's the price of life? 
 Some children are learning how to pull tricks while others learning to ride bikes 
 And this right here been under our noses 
 How we didn't notice? But now that we know this 
 Expose the darkness, if we the light of Christ 
 Then we gotta stop taking our reality in doses 
 It's your mother, your sister, your daughter, pray you see it 
 'Cause heroes ain't for sale and the body shouldn't be either 
 (Chorus - Co Campbell) 
 When is it all gon' change? Slavery still remains, yeah 
 Their minds, their hearts, all torn apart, yeah 
 We must remain till we see them broken chains, yeah 
 Your pain, your scars, we'll carry till your freedom is ours
