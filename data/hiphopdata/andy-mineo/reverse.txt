Why is the monster taller than ever, while the weak fade away? 
 When justice storms, and darkness flees, I'm reminded on that day 
 The last shall be first, the first shall be last 
 The last shall be and everything's in reverse 
 Livin' with the end in mind, something like the president 
 I was livin' for the moment, tryin' to own it, residence 
 Believe in Him, that's the last thing I'd ever chose 
 Gimme that red top, that sixty seven Chevy my cousin drove on them coldest 
 Life is short, I hope I make it down the road 
 But where I'm from hope was that girl who flirted, flaunted 
 You never got it, but she was the one you always wanted 
 How good a picture perfect image front and tell you lies 
 My version of perversion did it every day alive 
 And man that burden got me hurtin' lookin' for some answers 
 Endless searchin' just leave you burnin', Jo Jo Dancer 
 But mine ended when I saw the Lord would choose to hang 
 That type of love got me coming back, call it boomerang
