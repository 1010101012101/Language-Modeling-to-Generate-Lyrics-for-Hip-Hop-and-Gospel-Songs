Andy Mineo: 
 What you wanna do, act loco? 
 Hit 'em with the old to the flow 
 That I grew up on then I grew up on 
 I'm funny now how I flow for Hova 
 Heh, words twisted, but you know I'm sober 
 Never really been the type to pour up 
 When I get this thing going I don't like to slow up 
 Mouth moving like a motor when I bite the flow up 
 But I bet they won't stop let me go let me go 
 Woo! I'mma show off every ability God's giving me to go off 
 And ain't nobody mad about the beauty of the Vatican and the tabernacle 
 So, when I'm rapping you can add it in 
 Breaking 'em with the shatter 
 They're gonna wanna put me in a place with padding 
 I'mma damage 'em every time like a player that's on the cover of Madden 
 God be the original, we brag 
 Look at Him 
 Andy Mineo: 
 I feel like I'm Paganini 
 KB: 
 Uh, lemme do it 
 K to the second letter 
 Finna get it popping 
 Coming out the pocket like ooh! 
 Everybody get to rocking doing the Paganini 
 Gimme the beat, my tongue is like a violin 
 Give it to them like I'm not a human 
 When I'm doing what I'm doing, keeping it coming like an automatic shooting 
 When we get to ripping it ridiculous 
 And everybody gets to speaking about these riveting brothers that's going in again 
 But they don't know, even when they got that flow (when they got that flow) 
 I don't know why they boast, everybody's gifts borrowed 
 Look, producers, directors, skilled architects 
 Just do what they do to whom they're connected 
 True was the God that chooses to bless them 
 Who is the one you think they reflecting 
 Canon: 
 Canon, Yo, hey Andy, okay 
 So down for my clique, shut up, y'all corny, oh shoot, shut up 
 I've been itching to stick 'em up with this killer Canon coming to cut 'em and hit 'em harder Ooh kill 'em 
 Hold up, I've been hitting everything up in me like I'm Paganini 
 Hitting every rhythm like a milli chopped ya 
 I know you heard Twista, and Tech-a-Nina hitting ya but Canon's original 
 I'mma Midwest Monster, Kill em! 
 Blaaaat! blaaaat! Mineo and Kevin got adrenaline 
 Coming to drill 'em with the real gospel 
 Coming up with the game 
 Still the same 
 Bringing the name 
 Bringing the fame 
 To the glory they follow Him and the father 
 While I'm coming and killing the game 
 I'm breaking 'em off and we know 
 They steady tryna imitate the steelo 
 I'm hitting with fire, spitting super wild 
 Running with the young and unashamed 
 I'm Paganini on a kilo amigo
