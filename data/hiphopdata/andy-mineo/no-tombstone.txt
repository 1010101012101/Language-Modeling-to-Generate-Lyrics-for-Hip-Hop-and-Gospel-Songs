Bury me with no tombstone, 'cause I don't care if they know my name 
 To Christ be the glory, let my life's story show his fame 
 And If I don't represent, I know my whole life's been in vain 
 So lord what I'm asking for is your strength to endure... 
 Strength to endure this present pain (X2). 
 Lord, your strength is what I'm needin 
 I wanna see your face I need grace in this season 
 'Cause lately just praisin ain't been so easy 
 Like my hand weighed down with the cement 
 I see them heathens puttin' weed in the spliff 
 They tell me drop Jesus all you need is some of this 
 Well, some times I wanna give in I admit 
 Just creep with a chick, make money put that beat in my whip 
 But then I think about the lamb beaten and whipped 
 And how them fleeing pleasures can't compete with the gift 
 Of sweet salvation, they put nails in his wrists 
 So between me and God all the beef could be squished 
 Lord, I need your strength in the midst's of this storm 
 I read this 'in my weakness then I am made strong?' 
 Yo, I wanna know what it means like never before 
 So, I seek your presence with my head to the floor, I need... more 
 Lord I need your strength right now 
 'Cause every morning I wake up, I'm laying my life down 
 For the sake of the Gospel, compelled by your love 
 So when my mouth don't speak I hope my life does 
 When my mic's unplugged, and I ain't rockin' stages 
 What will people read when they see my lifes pages 
 Christ and his greatness and desire the same? 
 Or a man who was once on fire but never was again? 
 I seen so many men of the faith, fall on their face 
 And I know the wickedness of my won hearts so great 
 So I'm beggin for your grace, from the day that I was saved 
 I need strength to persevere until the end of this race, I need...
