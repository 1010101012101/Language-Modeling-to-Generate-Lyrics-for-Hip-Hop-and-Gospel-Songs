I'm caught dreaming 
 Of someone greater than me 
 Who calmed the sea 
 Upon a dream speaking to me 
 I'm caught dreaming 
 Why waste my breath singing words of praise 
 That are filled with myself 
 Who's greater 
 What love do I have that you didn't give 
 Cause all that I am is a product of grace 
 And what should I trust 
 Your love for me 
 Or my love for you 
 Who's greater 
 I'm caught dreaming 
 Of someone greater than me 
 Who calmed the sea 
 Upon a dream speaking to me 
 I'm caught dreaming 
 Of someone greater than me 
 Bringing liberty 
 The blood on your tree is saving me 
 I'm caught dreaming 
 Yeah, mouth full of praise, I love you so much 
 What an empty phrase, really I'm more amazed 
 How in spite of how I fail to do what you command to 
 Serve other gods like Baal, you never fail 
 That's illogical devotion, could it really be 
 You chose to die for the sinner while nothing was good in me 
 You never left me, even when the darkest days began 
 Nor forget me, only thing you're forgetting is my sin 
 I wanna make it to the end, let me remain faithful 
 All because you're faithful in me, yeah, I'm grateful 
 My mistakes can never stop me, choice you made to adopt me 
 The holes in your hands are the proof that you'll never drop me 
 I'm caught dreaming 
 Of someone greater than me 
 Who calmed the sea 
 Upon a tree speaking to me 
 I'm caught dreaming 
 Of someone greater than me 
 Bringing liberty 
 The blood on your tree is saving me 
 I'm caught dreaming. 
 I could sing how I love you, love you, 
 But your love for me is much greater, greater 
 And I could sing how I love you, love you 
 But your love for me is much greater, greater 
 I'm caught dreaming 
 Of someone greater than me 
 Who cut the sea 
 A burning tree speaking to me 
 I'm caught dreaming 
 I'm caught dreaming, dreaming
