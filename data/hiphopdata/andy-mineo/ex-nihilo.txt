(Verse 1 - Andy Mineo) 
 Yeah, who woulda thought I'd step inside this train station 
 Then get hit with some inspiration? 
 It's amazin' 
 The most beautiful pieces of art come from the ugliest situations 
 So I praise him, rejoicing in my suffering 
 'Cause I know he's got a masterpiece in the makin' 
 And I ain't scared of death nor Satan 
 'Cause I know whose hand that my name is engraved in 
 This right here is a proper statement 
 I am not the artist, I'm the canvas that he's paintin' 
 Like I remember last year being homeless 
 Sleeping on the air mattress, but on the phone with 
 Three record labels, who to go with? 
 I notice you like to fix things with them tools that are broken 
 So when them dark nights hit his soul 
 I know enough to know to trust you with what I don't 
 (Chorus - Christon Gray) 
 Bad days, I suppose, too much for me to remember 
 Let me back up, I'm too close, now I can see the whole picture 
 You make something out of nothing, nothing 
 You make something out of nothing, nothing 
 (Verse 2 - Andy Mineo) 
 Sitting back, meditating on creation 
 Thinking how you made everything out of naythin' 
 What a statement, you sustain it 
 Let there be, and there is, my brain can't contain this 
 That's why the fame and the claim is so dangerous 
 It'll make a heart sing that my name is the greatest 
 So Josh, Rich, Ray, Alex, Dave 
 Call me to repentance if I ever go astray 
 If that money ever get in the way, then I'll burn it 
 The price for my soul is something I couldn't pay 
 Sometimes I read them articles believin' what they say 
 Sweatin' my own press, God is so unimpressed 
 Naw, I'm a mess, made out of dust 
 To return to it upon death, my soul rests, and yet 
 They makin' heroes out of the ones who been rescued 
 Who cares if they remember my name if I forget you 
 (Chorus - Christon Gray) 
 Bad days, I suppose, too much for me to remember 
 Let me back up, I'm too close, now I can see the whole picture 
 You make something out of nothing, nothing 
 You make something out of nothing, nothing 
 (Verse 3 - Christon Gray) 
 Yo, here goes nothin' 
 I'm nothin' much, but he knows somethin' 
 Ex nihilo; he's next to zero, he leans on nothin' 
 And nothin' I want more than hear those trumpets 
 No nothin' I want more than to hear those trumpets 
 My earlobes jumpin', I feel so lovesick, 
 Lot of us got ideas but still no substance 
 And a lot of times I can see it but the mirror don't love Chris 
 (Chorus - Christon Gray) 
 Bad days, I suppose, too much for me to remember 
 Let me back up, I'm too close, now I can see the whole picture 
 You make something out of nothing, nothing 
 You make something out of nothing, nothing
