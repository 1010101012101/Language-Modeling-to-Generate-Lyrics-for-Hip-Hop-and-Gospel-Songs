 Andy Mineo: 
 Yo, I might just throw a Buddha round my necklace 
 They think paisano's wylin, that boy reckless 
 'Cause erryboy rockin' Jesus pieces 
 I'm just doin' what y'all doin', wearing stuff I don't believe in 
 Yuuup 
 You don't need skill for new rap 
 Check the first verse 
 You know I proved that 
 Takin' them selfies, girl why would you do that? 
 You know it's whack, and I do not approve that 
 I said red wine I don't mean where the booze at 
 I'm talkin' an offer you just can't refuse that 
 On a swag boat, I'm the captain 
 You can walk the plank for the yapping 
 Boy! 
 Marty: 
 Hey yo, rappers carry my mother's groceries, dog 
 Out of respeeeeect! 
 Marty: 
 Thirty chains around my neck 
 Mr. T and velour sweats 
 I got 'em like what's next? 
 I'm gonna kill the beat like an acapella 
 Social Club be them good fellas 
 Only good 'cause He met us 
 I'm a big mess, and couldn't be better 
 An', whatever, whatever I'm wylin! 
 Wylin, wylin, wylin 
 It's the 116 and the Misfits, and we wylin 
 Hey, yo, put my mom on the guest list 
 I'm so awkward it's impressive 
 Girl's like who the heck's this 
 You're kinda weird, but I respect it 
 I'm just young, Italian, and reckless, and we wylin! 
 Andy Mineo: 
 Listen, under normal circumstances 
 If someone's running their piehole 
 Just give 'em a good smack to the face 
 But I don't handle things the way I used to 
 I am a Christian boy now, you understand? Capisce? 
 Listen, you keep on running your piehole 
 And I'm gonna take you over to my grandmother's house 
 For a nice Sunday dinner 
 She'll have the ? the fresh mozzarella, the marinara 
 We'll have a real good time 
 When you can't eat anymore 
 We'll have 'er open up the fridge 
 And take out the canolis 
 And the pustard shots 
 And keep feeding you 
 And feeding you and feeding you 
 Eh? 
 Then I'm gonna drive you home 
 Throw you in the bathroom, lock the door 
 And burn every piece of toilet paper you own 
 You schmutz 
 God bless you and your family
