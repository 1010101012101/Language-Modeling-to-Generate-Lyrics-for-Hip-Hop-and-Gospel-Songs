I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter 
 I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter 
 I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter 
 I don't wanna be bitter... so take it all away 
 Anybody know the feeling of rejection 
 Feels like you was kicked in your midsection 
 When you feel like you simply just lost your best friend 
 Everybody play the game of love, you ride the bench and 
 You start thinking she's chillin' with other men, and you gettin' jealous, start beefing, and harboring harsh resentment 
 I'm asking Jesus to keep me from being bitter, go scheming on twitter, get mad and post it on my statuses 
 Bitterness can make a heart numb 
 But hope is like a star you don't see it shine bright until the dark come 
 So don't just scoop the dust, remove the rug 
 If I got unforgiveness in my heart, then there really ain't no room for love 
 Plus it's stupid cause, I've been so forgiven 
 That if I hold a grudge, I don't show He's risen 
 But I know my sins removed since Jesus came 
 With no reason to forgive me but He did so I do the same 
 Sometimes things just happen in life that don't make any sense, but, bitterness is a choice 
 I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter 
 I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter 
 I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter 
 I don't wanna be bitter... so take it all away 
 Yeah, I gotta tread softly 
 Don't wanna be a hypocrite plus I got some bitterness I wanna get up off me 
 Where should I start, well, I feel like I'd be sorta frontin' 
 To say that when my father calls that I don't hit ignore button 
 It's probably 'cause we never kicked it at a younger age 
 I know when he's calling but I don't have got his number saved 
 I keep dodging him but I'm just being honest 
 All he wanna do is talk football and how I should play in college 
 I get bitter, kinda cold like the winter 
 It's so hard for me to forgive him then I remember that I'm a sinner 
 And Jesus forgave me and washed away my sins 
 When I didn't deserve it then I could forgive him 
 His power in such amazing love like when Jesus forgave the ones that pinned him up on that cross as he was hanging from it 
 Holy Spirit, teach me to be just like the Son 
 Remove the roots of bitterness don't stop until your work is done 
 God I don't wanna be bitter, teach me to forgive, let me see my own sin 
 I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter 
 I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter 
 I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter 
 I don't wanna be bitter... so take it all away 
 Bitter, bitter, bitter 
 I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter 
 I don't wanna be bitter, bitter, bitter 
 I don't wanna be bitter... so take it all away
