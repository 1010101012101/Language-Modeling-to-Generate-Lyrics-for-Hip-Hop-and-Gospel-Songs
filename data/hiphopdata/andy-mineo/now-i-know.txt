Yeah, uh, look 
 The older I get, the more I realize 
 Almost everything that I believed 
 In my life was a lie 
 It started as a child, first was Santa Claus 
 Then I believed that a brawl would never come between my dawgs (wrong) 
 My sister Mary filled me in when I was 7 
 Told me Hulk Hogan only existed on television (what?) 
 The Stone Cold Stunner and the Leg Drop? 
 All scripted, N.W.O and X-Pac? Dang 
 I used to walk up to them automatic doors 
 My momma told me that my finger was the power source 
 So I pointed with my pointer, then pow 
 It was open, then come to find out she was joking 
 Had to let it soak in, my mind as a boy 
 Didn't wanna believe that McGwire or Barry were on the 'roids 
 But uh, when I was young, I thought the world was all right 
 It's funny, I even thought that Jesus was white, but yo 
 All that glitters ain't made of gold 
 It's the thing you've heard a million times before 
 It took a lot of time, now I realise 
 Now I know better 
 It's better late than never 
 Now I know 
 Over the years you get more accustomed to pain 
 Used to believe my dad when he said he'd come to my games 
 Even believed my mother was a saint and could do no wrong 
 And then she sat me down and told me how I was born (shoot) 
 Mind-blown, but now it all makes sense 
 Why she didn't spazz on me when she caught me having sex, uh 
 I was perplexed but now I get it 
 I used to think America was finished with racism 
 How could I miss it? 
 I'm mad so many people don't get it 
 Holding this list of black names but now I'm blacklisted? 
 Got older, it's like it got no different 
 I found out these independent artists isn't independent 
 Cause major labels fund them quietly to keep perception 
 That's deception in the game 
 Used to believe I wanted fame 
 Plus my name written in them lights 
 Now I know it's so much greater 'cause it's written in the hand of Christ 
 And I used to say the radio would play what the people wanted 
 Now I know they playing what's payin' 
 Feeling jaded, but somehow I still believe in God 
 I even thought a college education got me a job, man 
 All that glitters ain't made of gold 
 It's the things you heard a million times before 
 It took a lot of time, now I realise 
 Now I know better 
 It's better late than never 
 Now I know better 
 Yes I know better 
 Now I know better 
 Yes I know better 
 Now I know better 
 Yes I know better 
 Now I know better 
 Yes I know better 
 Now I know 
 Too many times before
