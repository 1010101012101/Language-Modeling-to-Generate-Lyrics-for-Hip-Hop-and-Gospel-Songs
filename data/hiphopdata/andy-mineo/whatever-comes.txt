Yeah 
 *Ahem* 
 Wow 
 Yeah 
 Uh 
 Whatever comes, whatever go 
 The Lord's teaching me He's in control 
 And if I never had anything more 
 Well at least I got Him yo He saved my soul 
 I'm all right 
 Hey 
 Whatever comes, whatever go 
 The Lord's teaching me He's in control 
 And if I never had anything more 
 Well at least I got Him yo He saved my soul 
 Man I can't choose I like the new school and the boom-bappin' 
 Most of these dudes are cartoon rappin' 
 They're super goofy. 
 Say you shooting, when you did a movie? Stop lying 
 You know you searching for acceptance homie stop tryin' 
 Rest in the fact that you are, but lemme define it 
 Sometimes we sitting right in front of treasure that we can't find 
 And truth is deadly if it's learned and not applied 
 Everything that happened in your life, yeah, God designed 
 And He's fully aware 
 With you even when you in that student affair office trying to choose a career 
 You might look at the cards you dealt and say that it ain't fair 
 But be careful, in our struggles that's when God is most near 
 What a blessing, the mysteries of God are so interesting 
 Like how I got free will but still pre-destined 
 The spirit that fills me of resurrected Jesus 
 We looking death in the eye like yo you can't defeat us 
 So I tell 'em 
 Whatever comes, whatever go 
 The Lord's teaching me He's in control 
 And if I never had anything more 
 Well at least I got Him yo He saved my soul 
 And so 
 Hey 
 Whatever comes, whatever go 
 The Lord's teaching me He's in control 
 And if I never had anything more 
 Well at least I got Him yo He saved my soul 
 Yo 
 I wrote this on Good Friday, but why they call it good? 
 An innocent man was beaten and nailed into wood 
 It's only through the lens of grace we see who that really should have been 
 Hanging from that tree, who the nails should have been put in... me. 
 The only place the world has ever seen complete justice, grace and love meet 
 The innocent One took the blame so I wouldn't have to 
 This is good unless you don't believe the bad news 
 For the sin you committed just in the last two minutes you deserve God's holy and just wrath dude 
 So let me ask you, you ever regret something like a tattoo of the name of your last boo? 
 Sin is so deep, all up in your skin 
 Like the sin that you try to delete 
 Cry and you weep 
 But unless the Christ died and He rise to His feet and ascended into the sky then our hope is obsolete 
 So I tell 'em 
 Whatever comes, whatever go 
 The Lord's teaching me He's in control 
 And if I never had anything more 
 Well at least I got Him, yo, He saved my soul 
 And it's all right 
 Hey 
 Whatever comes, whatever go 
 The Lord's teaching me He's in control 
 And if I never had anything more 
 Well at least I got Him yo He saved my soul 
 And it's all right 
 *Burp* 
 Woo!
