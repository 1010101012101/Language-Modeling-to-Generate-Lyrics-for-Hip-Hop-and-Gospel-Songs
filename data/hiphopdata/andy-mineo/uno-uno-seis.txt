 I rep that Wash Heights like all day, it's unashamed like cosmay 
 I try to walk that narrow path, but your boy live off of broadway 
 I took the A-train to 1-6-8, Americanos playin dominoes 
 And them platanos all on my plate, NEW YORK in my my state 
 But you know we take it international, we feelin' to follow anywhere the Master goes 
 So we hang with and bang with every language even though we speakin' that Spanglish like 
 Dirmelo loco, tato lets go, vamonos we out here oh 
 Mi amigos y yo venimos from the west side to the east coast so 
 Ain't nobody rappin' like this WHAT 
 Unashamed the name of my clique YUP 
 Todos los dias, hermanito, dale ya tu sabe AHH

 I'm on my uno (uno) uno (uno) seis you know my crew, bro 
 Unashamed since '02, bro, before the 1-1-6 tattoos, bro 
 Now you don't really know if you got time like that 
 To hear the truth and fellas never mind like that 
 But we unashamed, never been a game, spit it how we live it so we get it on a grind like that 
 From Tejas and that's Texas, A-T-L's where I'm resting 
 Said I might catch a plane to rep for my king, Puerto Rico's on my checklist 
 Boricuas, Cubanos, perdonen mi espanol 
 Aqui con mis hermanos, to give Jesus to these VATOS 
 I pop off, no Peter, all about the blood the body flesh eaters 
 Used to be the Walking Dead but that season ended, now partner I'm a believer

 Uno uno seis boy you know we don't play boy 
 Spit a lot of truth they call it the good news put it all up in your face boy 
 Catch us on arroz con frijoles with some tostones 
 We ain't worried 'bout folks thinking we phony 
 Jesus know me 
 Yes I Know I'm going and know what I'm doing 
 And only Yeshua can do it ???? got a raggity dude 
 You part of the movement that you rather pursue 
 Holla 1-1-6 if you rep the truth 
 (Andy Mineo) 
 Holla 1-1-6 if you rep the truth! SET 
 The booth ablaze, but the faith can take the trips too for the wages of the sin we choose 
 Thank you because you gave us news that'll break them chains, that will make us new 
 Mira mi caballo, I don't gotta pay nada, he took them hits like pi√±atas, HALLELUYAH the father 
 En cuerpo y mis palabras, le voy a dar la alabanza 
 1-1-6 be my partners, in God we trust not them dollars HAH
