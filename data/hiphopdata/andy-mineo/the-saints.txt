(Verse 1 - Andy Mineo) 
 I don't know but I've been told when the saints come marching in we roll 
 So deep that they can't believe we sold out seats and them CDs 
 Please don't sleep on the beat, I ... beat up these, still don't get it would you keep up please 
 We ain't no heroes for sale, if you bought one better keep your receipt 
 Okay, I get it, I know what they thinkin' 
 We some kum-ba-yah singin' corny Christians, keep your disses 
 By a ticket to a concert, pay a visit, think it's odd? 
 We them blues brothers, 116 on a mission from God 
 I don't think they get it, I really think what they gotta do is see it to believe it I wasn't planning on leaving them 
 Gimme the microphone with no gimmicks I'm really living this authentic, I may not condone it but I don't condemn it 
 If you ever wanna get it well tell 'em to come and get it, I point 'em to a God and we tell 'em we really with him 
 They thinkin' that I'm trippin' 'cause I'm livin' for more than just rappin' but that's what happens when ... 
 Oh when the saints go marching in 
 Oh when the saints go marching in 
 Oh when the saints go (marching in) 
 Saints go (marching in) 
 Saints go (marching in) 
 Saints go (marching in) 
 (Verse 2 - KB) 
 Oh no, here they go go; them boys sold out, no promo 
 Tell me give it 2 years it'll go cold, but they words got ate like ocho 
 I'ma keep it 300, in the streets probably wanna see us sto-oned 
 But we in it, we in it, we live it, we get it, our God gon' do what he want 
 We fragrant, the aroma is that our God saves 
 Married to the Rock and I'm faithful to take these words beyond say 
 Don't it feel like we famous, that the world will know what our name is 
 But heaven knows us baby, and that Book of Life is that A list 
 So I bow ... I'm so rich and I ain't talkin' 'bout cheddar 
 But I bank on Christ, go and talk to the teller; cut the checks that I get, I'll be cashing forever 
 Back for the saints I get a thing going, they be lackin' the pain that make us straight 
 Man we ain't lackin' a thing racked in the faith, paid by the blood of the Lamb that is paid, debt is paid 
 Oh when the saints go marching in 
 Oh when the saints go marching in 
 Oh when the saints go (marching in) 
 Saints go (marching in) 
 Saints go (marching in) 
 Saints go (marching in) 
 (Verse 3 - Trip Lee) 
 Now I don't know what you've been told about us, 'bout us 
 But we gon' love him even though they doubt us, doubt us 
 We just visitin' like we some out-of-towners 
 Got 'em asking us how does this God turn y'all into shouters (like hold up) 
 We don't really think we better, call us perfect no never 
 But we glad to be called saints 'cause Paul called us that in them letters 
 We set apart for the Savior, he's led our hearts to the Maker 
 Forget the art that we makin' if we never love our neighbors 
 You might catch us whistling, marked to the spot straight glistening 
 Shining 'cause we filled with Him, you might wanna listen in 
 Messiah came down then He reigned and He rose, here yeah they go with this again 
 That's what makes us love our neighbors, we not just omittin' sin 
 Oh when the saints go marching in 
 Oh when the saints go marching in 
 Oh when the saints go (marching in) 
 Saints go (marching in) 
 Saints go (marching in) 
 Saints go (marching in)
