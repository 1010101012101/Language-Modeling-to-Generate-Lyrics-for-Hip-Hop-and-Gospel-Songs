New York City 
 New York City 
 New York City 
 New York City 
 Uptown New York City where you can spot met 
 Uptown New York City where you can spot met 
 Uptown New York City where you can spot met 
 Uptown New York City where you can spot met 
 We in love with the invention, we don't love the inventor 
 On a quiet block they puff the loud, it be smellin' like it's timber 
 And they hit you with the fake smile, I ain't talkin' dentures 
 Starbucks on the corner, pushin' bucks for that rent up 
 Dippin' in all black like I'm venom 
 Keep it G, I'm not a star 
 But I'm raw like this denim 
 Them dope boys push the big body Jerome Betis 
 I got Santería hexes for my exes, but I'm protected 
 You heard that man got shot for his necklace? 
 That's a 1-8-7 up on 1-8-7 
 You know that uptown lifestyle reckless 
 When they eatin' mango and fried cheese for your breakfast 
 Baby, how you gon' complete your life checklist? 
 Spendin' every night watchin' Netflix 
 Time is so precious, gotta invest it where you spend it 
 If we prisoners to comfort, we judge our own sentence 
 I be uptown 
 Uptown New York City where you can spot met 
 Uptown New York City where you can spot met 
 Uptown New York City where you can spot met 
 Uptown New York City where you can spot met 
 I wake in that mornin', get in that café con leche 
 Don't y'all hold that azucar 
 My stomach's been showin' lately 
 Plus the crossover crazy 
 Don't get caught out here sleepin' 
 That's why they call Allen Irish, man, when I ball at Cabrini 
 I'm throwin' swishes 
 This right here that new school vintage 
 I been spendin' money tryin' not to spend up all these minutes 
 And I been present, man, look at what my gift is 
 Some push the white 'cause they ain't have the privilege 
 Let's get it! 
 Ain't no other city like the one I'm in 
 I got that Bustelo in my cup again 
 Jim Carrey with this here, I'm goin' dumb again 
 Me, myself and I, the only thing I'm up against 
 New York stayin' lit, rent high, payin' it 
 La Marina, bottled water, date night favorite 
 My bodega on the corner, I ain't even sayin' 
 They already know my order, they just started makin' it, whoa! 
 Ain't no other city make me feel this way 
 I been all around the world baby, but I'm here to stay 
 Oh-oh-oh-oh 
 Ain't no other city make me feel this way 
 I been all around the world baby, but I'm here to stay 
 Oh-oh-oh-oh 
 There's no place like Uptown, New York 
 Ain't no other city make me feel this way 
 I been all around the world baby, but I'm here to stay 
 Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh 
 There's no place like Uptown, New York
