You know, when I look around at everything it just 
 Blows my mind to think, "where'd this all come from?" 
 So I got some questions, like yo... 
 What's it all about? Why are we here? 
 If there's no reason, why do I care? 
 A lot of people put they thoughts in my ear 
 But I gotta know for myself, 
 So yo God, are you really there? 
 What's it all about? Why are we here? 
 If there's no reason, why do I care? 
 A lot of people put they thoughts in my ear 
 But I gotta know for myself, 
 So yo God, are you really there? 
 Man I'mma seek the truth till my brain hurt, 
 I'm just another soul 
 My life's like a sand grain in the dirt, 
 If we was made for a greater role 
 Than just living to die 
 What's the answer? I gots to know why 
 I don't want just another nice job and a ride 
 'Cause plenty people got that and wind up committin suicide 
 So I really don't care 'bout the physical 
 'Cause I know some know some millionaires that's miserable 
 My search goes deeper now, I'm asking more people 
 Like "what's the meaning of life for us creatures?" 
 The response I keep hearing back, "Love, Live, Laugh" 
 Man I already found that on a t-shirt 
 Some people wanna get tweaked, like philosophy class 
 They smoke riefer, drop acid, pop liberty caps, but that's misery 
 Within itself, no up or down, right or left, so I guess you're left living right 
 Man that's crazy, I'm searching for an absolute, 
 No vodka, I just wanna grasp the truth 'cause if I don't then, 
 Yo what a waste I might as well dig a hole in my grave 
 They keep telling me... 
 What's it all about? Why are we here?

 Yo God, are you really there? 
 Yo God, are you really there?
