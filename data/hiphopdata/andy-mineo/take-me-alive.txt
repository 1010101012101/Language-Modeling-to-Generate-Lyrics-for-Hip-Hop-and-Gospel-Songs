They say we all different, what's that common ground? 
 One day everybody gon' lay in that ground 
 If death is certain, then how you livin'? 
 And if heaven's real, tell me how you get it? 
 I'ma bet it on my life, it ain't gon' be by works 
 So I bet it all on Christ, boy lemme give you this work 
 Way before the moment I croak, I already been in that hearse 
 I'm already dead, I'm living in reverse, the first'll be last and the last'll be first 
 Following Jesus don't mean that there won't be pain 
 But, um, it does promise that none of it is in vain 
 And, um, I'm not afraid of that persecution that came 
 I'm more afraid of the fame and people knowing my name 
 Take me alive, take me alive 
 Take me alive while I'm still here 
 Take me alive, take me alive 
 Take me alive, take me while I'm still here 
 Take me alive, take me alive 
 Take me alive, take me while I'm still here 
 Take me alive, take me alive 
 Take me alive, take me while I'm still here 
 Been riding low key, y'all know me, Soli Deo glory be, 
 To the Father I can't lie though sometimes I want it all for me 
 Gotta kill that, gotta kill it, don't conceal that but reveal it 
 But I care what you think about me, the Father know it all and I'm still forgiven 
 I must decrease 'cause the way up is down 
 And His kingdom is out there, as crazy as that can sound 
 That's why blood is rushing to my head, dying's how I live 
 If you love your life, you'll lose it; if you lose it, then you'll gain it and 
 Wisdom is justified by all the children 
 God's worthy of my worship, so I'm defying my feelings 
 In my mess there's a message; in my test, testimony 
 He said no, I get to know him when I'm on that rock, you jabroni 
 I cannot be more stocky do, love me some shoes, shoulda got me two 
 But I'm thinking about the boxes inside my room, and I think about the kids that don't got no food 
 Uh, that one hurt, the truth is a mother, the Father of Lies wanna come up 
 Heavy one on one, the dark and the bell with the sinner, every day we dyin' 
 Take me alive, take me alive 
 Take me alive while I'm still here 
 Take me alive, take me alive 
 Take me alive, take me while I'm still here 
 Take me alive, take me alive 
 Take me alive, take me while I'm still here 
 Take me alive, take me alive 
 Take me alive, take me while I'm still here
