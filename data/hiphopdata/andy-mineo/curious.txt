Is it corny if I admit 
 That I check up on you from time to time when I'm on the net 
 I promise I ain't no stalker it's so awkward 
 When I actually come across you I act like I ain't bothered a bit 
 And you know what that is and I know too 
 That's pride mixed with lies mixed with I want you's 
 Kinda maybe sorta or the order could be off 
 Often I wonder if I regret what I lost 
 At a later time could my state of mind make me blind 
 I pray it isn't if it was I wouldn't admit it 
 I thought that I was heading in the right direction 
 But maybe loneliness has got me second guessing 
 I got some fly women they follow me on twitter 
 I think I'll DM'em all right I'm trippin' 
 But I'm hard wired for intimacy 
 So why does my loneliness lead to compromise 
 Oh contentment come quick 
 I'm still curious 
 Sometimes I'm still 
 I'm still (curious) 
 I'm still (curious) 
 I'm still curious (I think about you) 
 I'm still (curious) 
 I'm still (curious) 
 Is it weird it's been a few years 
 We celebrated the ball droppin' together (cheers) 
 The stuff you used to wear different products in your hair 
 When I smell'em in the air I feel like you're somewhere near 
 Is it me is it you was it lie was it truth 
 Maybe it's just that nobody's ever good enough for you 
 Ok I swear I'm going through asked my homie what to do 
 He said boy listen here 'cause I'm finna tell the truth 
 Everybody think about they ex's 
 Even if you got kids, married to your best friend 
 In them memories are easily made but hard to forget 
 'Cause they ex'ed up in your heart the good times and regrets 
 It's curiosity get you in trouble 
 Specially if it's forbidden kind that you run to 
 Ah yeah man you're more sensitive then you'll ever admit 
 So be careful who you make memories with 
 The secret is to learn what it means to be content 
 And celebrate what God's given not the things He didn't 
 Our heart is always longing for more and it wanna bug out 
 That's why we gotta drink from that water that never run out 
 But sometimes 
 I'm still curious 
 Sometimes I'm still 
 I'm still (curious) 
 I'm still (curious) 
 It takes a moment to make memories 
 A lifetime to forget 'em (curious) 
 That's why I'm still curious
