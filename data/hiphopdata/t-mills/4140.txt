Well I was never meant to work 
 But right now it's fuckin' crunch time 
 Grab your trays and get served 
 Like a high school lunch line 
 Bitch 
 They love you when you're hot 
 But they hate you when you're not 
 When I pull up to the spot 
 I make your girls jaw drop 
 I've never been shy 
 And you're lucky I'm alive 
 Because if I wasn't here 
 You'd have no way to get inspired 
 Damn 
 And you know nobody higher 
 Look up in my eyes and you can tell I blow that fire 
 Call that shit desire, the shit that makes you tighter 
 I'm just trying to stack some money up and then retire 
 Show me the money like Jerry McGuire 
 Cruisin' down PCH with my own driver 
 I'm great, like Tony the Tiger 
 Bowl of Frosted Flakes eat it every single night 'cause 
 I'm makin' my grand entrance in the room 
 And I'm trying to play it cool but I'm trippin' off shrooms 
 And I can't tell up from down 
 Left from right but your diggin' my sound 
 This goes down when I sing my hooks 
 Make the girls fall in love open up like books 
 This shit is bananas just like Gwen Stefani 
 And I swear your girls trying to be my baby's mommy 
 The girl in my car is the girl at the bar 
 She says you're a lame man your chillin' subpar 
 I got wood like Tiger, man they wanna flaunt me 
 I have dreams about my past and that shit haunts me 
 Now I'm just trying to live my life the best I can 
 Making moves so the money ends up in my hands 
 Some bitches hate me and the other ones are fans 
 It's 'cause I put it down like no one else can 
 Oh no 
 I'm about to go back in again 
 Chillin' in a room with seven white women 
 Sinnin' again swimmin' in money because I love it 
 I be poppin' bottles in public like FUCK IT 
 Been waitin' on my time to shine 
 Found my hustle, found my grind 
 I'm only gonna tell you motherfuckers this one more time
