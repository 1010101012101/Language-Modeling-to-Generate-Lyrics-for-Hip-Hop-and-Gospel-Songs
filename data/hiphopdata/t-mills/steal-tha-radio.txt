Im'a steal the radio (steal the radio) (x4) 
 Lay down I'm taking over 
 Turn it up then replay it over 
 You can't go anywhere without hearing me 
 Cause the airwaves gon play this 
 I'm here now just made it 
 Its real talk can't fake it 
 That's why I can say this 
 (I'm'a steal the radio) 
 Listen ev'rywhere you go 
 I'm killin' 'em the sabario 
 They love me marriage material 
 I'm'a con man with these songs man 
 It didn't take me long (damm) 
 This music stuff is my strong hand 
 And this rite here is my new jam 
 I'm'a steal the radio (x8) 
 Now that it's been stolen and the game is in my grasp now 
 I'm holding on with all my might so don't ask for a hand out 
 Or a hand me down I can't stand it now 
 These favorites are like family now 
 Change the dail, wait leave it here 
 Crazy to think what I did in a year 
 When I look in the mirror all I see 
 Is greatness lookin' back at me 
 I got stereo's for a CD's 
 But all I want this stations paying me 
 And had those DJ's playing me 
 And had me selling out hella seats 
 Leave the show hit my suite 
 And see my self on mtv 
 I'm'a steal the radio (x9)
