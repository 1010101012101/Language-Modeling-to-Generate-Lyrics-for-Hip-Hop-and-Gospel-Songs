I gotta girl, but she ain't home 
 Wanna hump? 
 Just come on over 
 You ain't gotta go, she ain't gotta know 
 You wanna hump? 
 Just come on over 
 The lights dim, the radios up, and it's playing my song 
 I'ma sing it for ya 
 The tapes in, the cameras on 
 We gonna be here till the morn, I gotta thing for ya 
 It ain't wrong if I make you feel right 
 Feel right, feel right, feel right, feel right 
 I'ma have it my way, you can fill my appetite 
 You make me say, you scandalous, you you so scandalous 
 You so scandalous but damn that pussy glamorous 
 You so scandalous, you so you so scandalous 
 You so scandalous, but damn that pussy glamorous 
 I dish it out, you eat it up 
 No lovin', we just fuckin' yeah I beat it up 
 With me around, yeah it's a rap 
 I get that blood pumpin, call me Mr. Cardiac 
 The doors locked, the blinds are shut 
 Let me ask you what, I gotta question for ya 
 Let's go again, I'm talking round two 
 We're gonna be here till the morn, I gotta thing for ya 
 It ain't wrong if I make you feel right 
 Feel right, feel right, feel right, feel right 
 I'ma have it my way, you can fill my appetite 
 You make me say, you scandalous, you so you so scandalous 
 You so scandalous but damn that pussy glamorous 
 You so scandalous, you so you so scandalous 
 You so scandalous, but damn that pussy glamorous 
 Light a candle, it's a scandal 
 Yeah, we're water gatin 
 Sheets wetter then a fucking water bed breaking 
 I pull your hair, you like it rough 
 I'm patient girl, you tell me when you had enough 
 I got my girl, we are just some signs 
 But you a centerfold, make you fool around 
 Come on baby do it to me one more time 
 I'm runin through it, like a stop sign 
 You scandalous, you so you so scandalous 
 You so scandalous but damn that pussy glamorous 
 You so scandalous, you so you so scandalous 
 You so scandalous, but damn that pussy glamorous 
 You so scandalous, you so you so scandalous

 You so scandalous, you so you so scandalous 
 You so scandalous, but damn that pussy glamorous
