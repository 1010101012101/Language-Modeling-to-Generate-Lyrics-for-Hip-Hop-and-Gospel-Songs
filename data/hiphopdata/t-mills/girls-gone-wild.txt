Shut up girl, I know just what you're thinking 
 Pink stuff in my cup, that's what I'm drinking 
 Shut up girl, I know just what you're thinking 
 Pink stuff in my cup, that's what I'm drinking 
 Damn it feels so good to be young 
 C'mon love before the night is done 
 We need to 
 Get away 
 I've been lookin' at you but I didn't know what to say 
 And let's take our time 
 Let me get inside 
 Lets take out time 
 Let me get inside 
 She's pullin' at my shirt 
 And she's tearing off my jeans she said 
 I love your tattoos and the way you sing 
 She's pullin at my shirt 
 And she's tearing off my jeans she said 
 A love your tattoos and the way you sing 
 She says I'm everything she needs 
 I say she's coming home with me 
 She says I'm everything she needs 
 I say she's coming home with me 
 I'm at the club it's like GIRLS GONE WILD 
 I'm on my bus it's like GIRLS GONE WILD 
 Fucking with us is like GIRLS GONE WILD 
 I haven't fucked this many girls in a while 
 I need a girl who knows how to party hard 
 Takin' off her pants rackin' lines with her credit card 
 Off with the top gettin' down on some shots 
 She's screamin' every evening begging me DON'T STOP 
 I need a girl whose down to get naked 
 Get drunk and come over maybe we can tape it 
 And baby girl you should probably just face it 
 I'm the fuckin' best, I'm so high I need a spaceship 
 I'm at the club it's like GIRLS GONE WILD 
 I'm on my bus it's like GIRLS GONE WILD 
 Fucking with us is like GIRLS GONE WILD 
 I haven't fucked this many girls in a while
