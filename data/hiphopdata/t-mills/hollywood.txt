I ain't tryin' to dis you, I just miss you 
 You wanna be a star? Huh? 
 Tell me what's the issue of the interview 
 I'd probably read it, re-tweak, then delete it 
 Every song, it'll be wrong 
 But it won't ever get completed 
 I'll hear it 
 You go and get your club on 
 Just because the stars come, doesn't mean you are one 
 Uh, attracted to my old news 
 What happened to the old you? 
 Remember when I told you? 
 You think you're so Hollywood, Hollywood 
 Diamonds and fancy cars, movie stars 
 Everyone thinks you're so Hollywood, Hollywood 
 But, they don't really know who you are 
 They don't, they don't 
 Like I do 
 Hollywood, Hollywood 
 You wanna be a big star? Big Star 
 Everyone thinks you're so Hollywood, Hollywood 
 But I'm the only one who knows who you really are 
 I know, I know 
 You think you're so Hollywood, Hollywood 
 I know who you are 
 I know who you are 
 You think you're so Hollywood, Hollywood 
 I know who you are 
 I know who you are 
 There's no talking to you 
 You oh so jaded 
 And I bet when you're fucking 'em you have to fake it 
 You can watch me make it 
 Regret our old mistakes 
 Took for you to realize you're chasin famous 
 I see it 
 You go with your love gone 
 Just because the stars come, doesn't mean you are one 
 Uh, attracted to my old news 
 What happened to the old you? 
 Remember when I told you? 
 You think you're so Hollywood, Hollywood 
 Diamonds and fancy cars, movie stars 
 Everyone thinks you're so Hollywood, Hollywood 
 But, they don't really know who you are 
 They don't, they don't 
 Like I do 
 Hollywood, Hollywood 
 You wanna be a big star? Big Star 
 Everyone thinks you're so Hollywood, Hollywood 
 But I'm the only one who knows who you really are 
 I know, I know 
 You think you're so Hollywood, Hollywood 
 I know who you are 
 I know who you are 
 You think you're so Hollywood, Hollywood 
 I know who you are 
 I know who you are 
 I know who you are 
 I know, I know, I know who you are 
 You think you're so Hollywood, Hollywood 
 Diamonds and fancy cars, fancy cars 
 Everyone thinks you're so Hollywood, Hollywood 
 But, they don't really know who you are 
 They don't know 
 Like I do 
 Hollywood, Hollywood 
 You wanna be a big star? Big Star 
 Everyone thinks you're so Hollywood, Hollywood 
 But I'm the only one who knows who you really are 
 They don't know 
 You think you're so Hollywood, Hollywood 
 I know who you are 
 I know who you are 
 You think you're so Hollywood, Hollywood 
 I know who you are 
 I know who you are
