We only like it if it's loud, we only like it if it's loud (if it's loud) 
 We only like it if it's loud, we only like it if it's loud, if it's 
 Hello to me, l-o-u-d full throttle 
 Turn it up loud pack 
 Burn it up, big faces earn it 
 Pockets straight perm it 
 Bass knocks this place rocks 
 My face numb, my jaw drops 
 Ratatat 
 Loud pipes 
 How you like this sound bite 
 Hey bitch I'm back at it 
 I'm back at it (I'm back at it) 
 Made a classic automatic never average 
 Get it crackin' we battin' no eyelashes sunglasses 
 We stay blasted 
 We only like it if it's loud, we only like it if it's loud (if it's loud) 
 We only like it if it's loud, we only like it if it's loud, if it's 
 The volume, the volume, the volume 
 Pump up the volume 
 The volume, the volume, the volume 
 Pump up the volume 
 Pockets on loud when I walk around 
 Yeah, they say we got the sound 
 Yeah, never turn it down 
 We yellin' pump up the volume 
 We only like it if it's loud, we only like it if it's loud, if it's loud 
 We always find a way to turn it up again 
 Never turn it down, we yellin' pump up the volume 
 Never goin' home alone but always getting home late 
 We can get it crackin', iPhone without a phone case 
 Kush keep calling me 
 I'm higher than my phone rate, she wanna be my bitch 
 So imma show her how this bone taste, no brakes need more bass 
 Now turn it up & we ridin' 
 It ain't my fault they can't pull me over if I can't hear the sirens 
 I don't even need a microphone 
 Compared to me y'all mimin' 
 Keep my stereo to the max, middle finger up to the silence 'cause 
 We only like it if it's loud, we only like it if it's loud if it's loud 
 We only like it if it's loud 
 We only like it if it's 
 The volume, the volume, the volume 
 Pump up the volume

 Want it loud

 Aw yeah, 'cause they know we got the sound 
 Want it loud, we want it want it loud

 Pockets on loud when I walk around here 
 They say we got the sound
