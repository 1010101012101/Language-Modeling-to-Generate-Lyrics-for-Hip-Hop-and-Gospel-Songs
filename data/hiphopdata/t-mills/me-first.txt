I really wanna be with you baby 
 But I gotta do me first. 
 I know you like it when we loving, 
 And I know that it hurts. 
 And when it's all said and done, at the end of the day 
 I've already had my fun 
 So there's nothing left to say. 
 I tried to keep this going as long as I could've 
 Didn't tell you things that I probably should've. 
 Things were going great since the moment that we hooked up 
 Now your head is down and I need you to look up 
 Not 'cause I hate you, I really want to date you 
 And just know nobody can replace you. 
 Not trying break you, I just wanna make you see the things that I gotta do for me 
 Friends telling you to forget me, now they got you wishing that you never met me 
 In a few years, I'll be back if you let me and when I'm on the road it's ok if you text me. 
 If you can't stand it, feel like I planned this, girl, you're dead wrong, yeah, you're dead wrong 
 I wanna be honest, I'm just not on it. But maybe one day, maybe one day. 
 I really wanna be with you baby 
 But I gotta do me first. 
 I know you like it when we loving, 
 And I know that it hurts. 
 And when it's all said and done at the end of the day 
 I've already had my fun 
 So there's nothing left to say. 
 It's been a while since we talked last, isn't it crazy how the fast times past? 
 Remember the nights when we would lay awake and touch on each other till the break of day? 
 It's funny how things change I hope your doing great 
 I found your picture in my wallet from our first date 
 I hope you moved on, but still remember me. This is what I done, at least we got memories 
 Don't dwell on it, just smile now you'll be fine. You'll be fine somehow 
 (X4) I really wanna be with you baby 
 But I gotta do me first. 
 I know you like it when we loving, 
 And I know that it hurts. 
 And when it's all said and done at the end of the day 
 I've already had my fun 
 So there's nothing left to say.
