I've been movin like I never learned how to stop 
 The stickiest eyes glued, intrigued to watch 
 I've been hearing things, actually, shit a lot 
 How come the pretty people, speak that ugly talk? 
 Feelin' me now, trying to figure me out 
 My secrets stay where I stay as well 
 Don't tell, gotta keep the mystery 
 They want every piece they can get from me 
 I'm alone, on my own 
 Gotta seize my shit, and tell your friends to get off my d-- 
 New money, young kid 
 And they copycat the Favourite 
 Forget how I feel for right now 
 You always have a way to find things out 
 As hard as I try to keep it low, you bring it up again 
 You don't care 
 Oh, just like me 
 Don't go there 
 Oh, just like me 
 You can't do what I can do, you wannabe 
 Oh, just like me 
 Got secrets too 
 Creepin' up on you 
 You can't do what I can do, you wannabe 
 Nothins free, but if it's for me 
 Then it don't apply, I'm a rule changee 
 Get my weed from her or she 
 Bring it over, delivery 
 What's the deal with these copycats? 
 Wash them out 
 Laundry mats 
 Like stains, tryna be stuck to me 
 But I'm too damn sharp, cutlery 
 One of a kind, and ahead of my time 
 It's that shit that makes you hit rewind 
 Tough to shine, when you're stuck behind 
 'Cause I ate you up, now I'm down to nine 
 I'm sick inside 
 From the way I drive, to the way I write, to the way I type, to they way I fly and get high 
 I get high 
 Forget how I feel for right now 
 You always have a way to find things out 
 As hard as I try to keep it low, you bring it up again 
 You don't care 
 Oh, just like me 
 Don't go there 
 Oh, just like me 
 You can't do what I can do, you wannabe 
 Oh, just like me 
 Got secrets too 
 Creepin' up on you 
 You can't do what I can do, you wannabe 
 Oh, just like me 
 Just, just, just like me 
 Just, just, just like me 
 Just, just, just like, like, me, me 
 Oh, just like me 
 Oh, just like me 
 Oh, just like me 
 Oh, just like me 
 Oh, just like me 
 Forget how I feel for right now 
 You always have a way to find things out 
 As hard as I try to keep it low, you bring it up again 
 You don't care 
 Oh, just like me 
 Don't go there 
 Oh, just like me 
 You can't do what I can do, you wannabe 
 Oh, just like me 
 Got secrets too 
 Creepin' up on you 
 You can't do what I can do, you wannabe 
 Oh, just like me
