I like those rich girls 
 With a fist full of rings 
 I like those rich girls 
 Who will buy me things 
 I like those rich girls 
 In designer jeans 
 But I laugh behind their back 'cause they're not up on my schemes.

 Let me tell you one of my favorite things 
 A wealthy girl with no self esteem 
 She loves me so at my shows she sing, 
 As she powders her nose with her Bentley keys 
 But tonight 
 It's not on me 
 She got me at the bar with no I.D. 
 I got money but I stay low-key 
 If I need my weed I reach in the Louie V 
 This ain't nothin' new to me 
 Chillin' in the back VIP 
 Juicy bag and matchin' jewelry 
 Girl I think you're the one for me 
 HEY I just wanna let you know 
 Your bank account is beautiful 
 HEY I just wanna let you know 
 Your bank account is beautiful 
 I like those rich girls 
 With a fist full of rings 
 I like those rich girls

 I wanna see your purse overflow 
 Come on girl let a little skin show 
 Whoa 
 Drop it down to the floor 
 'Cause I'm only in town for a night or so 
 Back to the hotel we can go 
 Quiet on the creep so they don't know 
 And I heard you got money to blow 
 Good thing I'm here 'cause I'm a pro 
 Ya love you're filthy rich 
 Brand new jeans with the matching kicks 
 Ya girl you're the shit 
 And your house in the hills is too legit 
 HEY I just wanna let you know 
 Your bank account is beautiful 
 HEY I just wanna let you know 
 Your bank account is beautiful 
 And there has got to be something between 
 You and me it's clear to see 
 And there has got to be something between
