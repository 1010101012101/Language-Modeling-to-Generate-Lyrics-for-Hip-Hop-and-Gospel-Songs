It's million, from the L down to the A down 
 It ain't really like me to stop what I'm doing 
 But if you come to town I just might have to do it 
 And I'm twice as smoother than a razor to your leg, yeah 
 Champagne pouring down your dress out in Vegas 
 Come on, gamble on me 'cause I need you here 
 And I'm waitin' to tell, see the cash here 
 I know a lot of girls who would kill to beat you 
 But they don't appeal to me 
 So it's all rest in, go for the all or leave with nothin' 
 Girl, we about to get it in, I like it like that 
 Let me show you something, come here 
 L.A. it down, L.A. it down when your plane lands 
 I hope that you don't make plans 
 L.A. it down, L.A. it down, tied my schedule for you 
 I got something special for you 
 L.A. it down, L.A. it down 
 I'll get you out here with me 
 We'll be sliding through the city 
 L.A. it down, L.A. it down 
 Got something special for you when you come to California 
 Just got in we can chill for a little 
 Let me tell you about my new video for a little 
 We gone make up, bake up breakfast at the griddle 
 But right about now I would kill for a little piece of that pie 
 You so sweet, girl, tell me why 
 Wanna put whip cream between your thighs 
 Then miracle whip my tongue inside 
 This is your vacation at our undiscovered patience 
 'Cause all the L.A. girls hatin', wanna come to fuck our functional 
 I won't let 'em 'cause you'll leave tomorrow 
 But you'll be back again, till then I'll see you 
 L.A. it down, L.A. it down when your plane lands 
 I hope that you don't make plans 
 L.A. it down, L.A. it down, tied my schedule for you 
 I got something special for you 
 L.A. it down, L.A. it down 
 I'll get you out here with me 
 We'll be sliding through the city 
 L.A. it down, L.A. it down 
 Got something special for you when you come to California 
 Got something special for you when you come to California 
 Got something special for you when you come to California 
 Got something special for you when you come to California 
 You can stay for whenever, for however long you please 
 I got you with whatever for forever, come see this routine 
 Full of traveling will have you coming back to me 
 Yeah, coming back to me, I know 
 L.A. it down, L.A. it down when your plane lands 
 I hope that you don't make plans 
 L.A. it down, L.A. it down, tied my schedule for you 
 I got something special for you 
 L.A. it down, L.A. it down 
 I'll get you out here with me 
 We'll be sliding through the city 
 L.A. it down, L.A. it down
