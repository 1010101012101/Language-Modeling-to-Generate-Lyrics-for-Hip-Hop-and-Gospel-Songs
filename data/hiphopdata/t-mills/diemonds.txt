We're all diemonds, but we're gonna shine forever 
 Like a diamond in the sky 
 When they carry me home, when I'm gone 
 I'll still be singing a million years after 
 We are dia-, we are dia-, we are diamonds 
 Standing in decline, can't get it by, money make the world go round 
 Got me living life fast, just like that, it could all end right now 
 Tell 'em, till I di-e, di-e, give it up when it all falls down 
 Tell 'em, till I di-e, di-e, give it up when it all falls down 
 'Cause this is how it feels when you find yourself 
 Kind of like a diamond you mine yourself 
 Mind over matter, time don't matter 
 Remember to remind yourself 
 We're all diemonds, but we're gonna shine forever 
 Like a diamond in the sky 
 When they carry me home, when I'm gone 
 I'll still be singing a million years after 
 We are dia-, we are dia-, we are diamonds 
 I ain't got a price that will save my life, imma leave it up in the air 
 Thinking about the heights that will change my life, never said life was fair 
 Till I di-e, di-e, give it up when it all falls down 
 Till I di-e, di-e, give it up when it all falls down 
 'Cause this is how it feels when you find yourself 
 Kind of like a diamond you mine yourself 
 Mind over matter, time don't matter 
 Remember to remind yourself 
 We're all diemonds, but we're gonna shine forever 
 Like a diamond in the sky 
 When they carry me home, when I'm gone 
 I'll still be singing a million years after 
 We are dia-, we are dia-, we are diamonds 
 We don't wish on stars, that's just how we are 
 We are dia-, we are dia-, we are diamonds 
 We're all diemonds, but we're gonna shine forever 
 Like a diamond in the sky 
 When they carry me home, when I'm gone 
 I'll still be singing a million years after 
 We are dia-, we are dia- 
 We're all diemonds, but we're gonna shine forever 
 Like a diamond in the sky 
 When they carry me home, when I'm gone 
 I'll still be singing a million years after 
 We are dia-, we are dia-, we are diamonds
