I L.O.V.E. 
 T. Mills and Captain Midnight on the beat 
 The Finders Keeper EP 
 And yo I'm doin' it solo like Hans 
 Unique over beats so you know I drop bombs 
 Bitch look me up, tattoos in my palms 
 So I'm gettin' wetter than a fish in a pond 
 But I play it safe, always wear a condom 
 Lifestyles tend to break so I rock Magnums 
 Yo I ain't from the bay but I make her go dumb 
 She said Mills I ain't gonna stop till I make you cum 
 You can love me or you can hate me 
 You can fuck me or you can date me 
 Call me asshole or call me baby 
 I don't really care it's all the same thing 
 You can love me or you can hate me 
 You can fuck me or you can date me 
 Call me asshole or call me baby 
 I don't really care it's all the same thing 
 I got a style so pure it'll leave your face numb 
 High off my lines over snare and bass drums 
 Hooked to my hooks you can't help but listen 
 And everything's better with some kush in my system 
 If life is a bitch then I got a trophy wife 
 And I just wanna get some cut like a knife 
 Hey girl what's up for tonight 
 'Cause I wanna see what it's like from the inside 
 You can love me or you can hate me 
 You can fuck me or you can date me 
 Call me asshole or call me baby 
 I don't really care it's all the same thing 
 You can love me or you can hate me 
 You can fuck me or you can date me 
 Call me asshole or call me baby 
 I don't really care it's all the same thing
