I got, I got the cure in my cup (Hey) 
 I got, I got the cure in my cup 
 Girls got me rushing with the pussy got me hungry 
 I like my hoes flexible 
 In my mouth like gum bitch 
 Speaking at a gun speed 
 They don't know what hit 'em 
 They keep coming back for more and that's when I just quit em' 
 I talk on my phone just so she'll leave me alone 
 Just because we fuck doesn't mean I'll take you home 
 Hoe you got to go 
 Hoe you got to go 
 'Cause I do my own thing and if you didn't now you know 
 I sit back and smoke kill 
 Life is fucking short, that's why I live for thrills 
 Eyes hella pale 
 Favorites with me still 
 I know I I'm not perfect this is just how I deal 
 Comin' hella heavy with a secret 
 Cure in my cup and I'm about to drink it, drink it 
 Everything's better when I'm leanin' 
 I've figured this shit out, so now I will be screamin' 
 Show me a good time 
 I wanna feel like this all night 
 I got, I got, I got the cure in my cup 
 We got bitches in the back 
 Yeah, they throw their hands up 
 We flyin' while we drivin' 
 We don't give a fuck 
 I got the cure in my cup 
 I got, I got the cure in my cup 
 I hang out late with girls from different states 
 They're cool for a night but not the type I would date 
 They give me weed, so I guess I'm down to kick it 
 And they swear they don't but I know they wanna picture 
 Blow it in they face if they don't wanna hit it 
 'Cause I'm hittin' everything bitch, I'm in the triple digits 
 Cold hard cash money chillin' in the fridge's 
 I don't have a bank account, I just keep it in my kitchen 
 I do shit different, better then you thought I would 
 I can't even think right now, even though I probably should 
 I'm with the futuristic, timeless 
 I'ma break her back, break her back, spineless 
 But if tonight takes a turn for the worst, the cure in my cup's gunna quench my thirst 
 Ya, you got in the party but you showed up first 
 I showed up late with good times to disperse 
 Show me a good time 
 I wanna feel like this all night 
 I got, I got, I got the cure in my cup 
 We got bitches in the back 
 Yeah, they throw there hands up 
 We flyin' what we drivin'? 
 We don't give a fuck 
 I got the cure in my cup 
 I got, I got the cure in my cup 
 Don't forget, don't forget the rest 
 I won't forget, I won't forget the rest of me 
 I let it get, I let it get the best of me 
 Comin' hella heavy with a secret 
 Cure in my cup and I'm about to drink it 
 Everything better when I'm leanin' 
 I've figured this shit out, so now I will be screamin' 
 Show me a good time 
 I wanna feel like this all night 
 I got, I got, I got the cure in my cup 
 We got bitches in the back 
 Yeah, they throw there hands up 
 We flyin, what we drivin'? 
 We don't give a fuck 
 I got the cure in my cup 
 I got, I got the cure in my cup
