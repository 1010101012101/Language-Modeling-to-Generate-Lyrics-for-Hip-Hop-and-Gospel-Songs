I wanna party, let's get drunk 
 I'm gonna grab another cup 
 And let's smoke another blunt 
 We ain't stoppin', never stoppin' 
 I wanna party, let's get drunk 
 I'm gonna grab another cup 
 And let's smoke another blunt 
 We ain't stoppin' till the sun comes up 
 It's a Friday night and 
 I don't plan on sleepin' soon 
 I'm looking for a ten 
 But she's locked in the bathroom 
 I'll just find another one 
 The night is young 
 I'm having fun 
 Killed two forties, twerped one up 
 And now I'm chillin' done 
 How come, 
 All of these girls look the same 
 Ya, I got with her but I don't know her name 
 I'm not gonna call her, I can give you her AIM 
 But the crazy bitch only wants me for my fame 
 I wanna party, let's get drunk 
 I'm gonna grab another cup 
 And let's smoke another blunt 
 We ain't stoppin', never stoppin' 
 I wanna party let's get drunk 
 I'm gonna grab another cup 
 And let's smoke another blunt 
 We ain't stoppin' till the sun comes up 
 Tonight I wanna make some mistakes 
 Consume a lot of drinks and get shitfaced 
 Wanna meet a lot of girls 
 Spit a little game 
 Pop bottles with the models and drink pink champagne 
 I'm parked out front 
 Gettin' brain in a range 
 My night life might seem so strange 
 But this is what I do 
 Who the fuck are you? 
 I'm not askin' 'cause I'm mad 
 I'm askin 'cause you're cute 
 I wanna party let's get drunk 
 I'm gonna grab another cup 
 And let's smoke another blunt 
 We ain't stoppin', never stoppin' 
 I wanna party let's get drunk 
 I'm gonna grab another cup 
 And let's smoke another blunt 
 We ain't stoppin' till the sun comes up
