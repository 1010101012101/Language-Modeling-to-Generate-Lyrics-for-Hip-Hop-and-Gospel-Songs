If looks could kill, you'd be a murderer 
 They say hindsight is 20/20 
 But your eyes are always stunning 
 It's a tragedy 
 I'm a causality 
 Cause you fell in love with me 
 Hurt before some years 
 You just had to get me 
 Every time I went out, my parents wouldn't let me 
 Call me 4 times 
 A couple more times 
 Your body is off the hook 
 So where's my phone line? 
 I wouldn't act distant 
 If you weren't persistent on being crazy bitch 
 That's why I'm actin' different 
 Run and tell all your friends I'm a dick head 
 Then tell every girl in the world how good the sex is 
 If looks could kill, you'd be a murderer 
 They say hindsight is 20/20 
 But your eyes are always stunning 
 It's a tragedy 
 I'm a causality 
 Cause you fell in love with me 
 You can't take ur eyes off me 
 You can't take ur eyes off me 
 You got everything you wanna 
 But you can't have me too, too 
 You can't take ur eyes off me 
 You can't take ur eyes off me 
 You got everything you wanna 
 But you can't have me too, too, too 
 Despite your best intentions 
 They were your worst mistakes 
 Girl, you eat attention in the worst ways 
 You're thirstay and no I won't stay another minute 
 How'd you think I wouldn't end it? 
 You ain't got an ounce of confidence in you 
 And I don't have the time to begin to explain everything that's on my brain 
 'Cause it's obvious you ain't gonn change 
 If looks could kill, you'd be a murderer 
 They say hindsight is 20/20 
 But your eyes are always stunning 
 It's a tragedy 
 I'm a causality 
 Cause you fell in love with me 
 You can't take ur eyes off me 
 You can't take ur eyes off me 
 You got everything you wanna 
 But you can't have me too, too, 
 You can't take ur eyes off me 
 You can't take ur eyes off me 
 You got everything you wanna 
 But you can't have me too, too, too 
 Gone off the deep end 
 You've gone off the deep end 
 You've gone off the deep end 
 You've gone off the deep end 
 You can't take ur eyes off me 
 You can't take ur eyes off me 
 You got everything you wanna 
 But you can't have me too, too, 
 You can't take ur eyes off me 
 You can't take ur eyes off me 
 You got everything you wanna 
 But you can't have me too, too, too 
 You can't take ur eyes off me 
 You can't take ur eyes off me 
 You got everything you wanna 
 But you can't have me too, too, too
