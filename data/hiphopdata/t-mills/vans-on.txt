 To the motherfuckin' ceiling like a stripper pole

 The same one to roll my trees up and also iron my clothes

 And by dos I mean in Spanish, one, Angelina and rose, so 
 My hair long and her hair did, I'm tatted, she tatted 
 She careful and I'm careless and I'm swaggin', she swaggin' 
 Most hate but she don't care bitch, but this just for tonight
