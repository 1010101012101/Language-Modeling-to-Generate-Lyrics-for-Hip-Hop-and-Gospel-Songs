I love the way home feels and smells, been here since 12, 
 That's where I tripped there's where I fell, I sleep by that tree and dreamt so well, 
 I never knew a girl like you uh and I sure wont meet another, 
 But if you can't see that this whole street isn't big enough for me then 
 We've been in different places, imma just go imma just go [X2] 
 You can stay in that small town (town town) but imma break out (break out) 
 Id rather lose your love than have to stay and live in doubt, 
 Now I'm leaving home, for another place on a different street in a different state, 
 Now I'm leaving home, caus you always say it's the only way you wish id stay (stay stay stay), 
 Now I'm leaving home, I'm leaving home 
 I can find a place that's well and good, as well as you 
 But I need change and change needs me too (too too), 
 I can't come second for the second, but first of all it's not my fault, 
 You may hate me try to blame me your friends wont hear my side at all, 
 We'll split and tear bid farewell, you'll tell me I'm not welcome here, 
 We can laugh it off over coffee when I visit next year its just uh 
 We've been in different places, imma just go imma just go [X2] 
 You can stay in that small town (town town) but imma break out (break out)

 Now I'm leaving home, caus you always say it's the only way you wish id stay (stay stay stay), 
 Now I'm leaving home, I'm leaving home 
 Watch me go, watch me go (oh oh) 
 We've been in different places, imma just go imma just go [X5]
