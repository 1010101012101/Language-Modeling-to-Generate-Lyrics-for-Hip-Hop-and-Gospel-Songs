Get low, get loose get, down on the floor 
 Drink up till you can't think anymore 
 Get low, get loose, get down on the floor 
 I ain't gonna change, I'm not just a stupid boy 
 I do everything I want to. Last night was somethin' I wish I knew 
 You hate all the games that I put you through. 
 I ain't gonna change, Nah I ain't gonna change for you 
 I'm a smart dude, I'm tryin' get my learn on. 
 You got your girls and they all fine, lets go get our burn on 
 I love the way I'm feelin' single, searchin' for the evening' 
 You can spend the night if you don't plan on us both sleepin' 
 Get low, get loose, get down on the floor 
 Drink up till you can't think anymore 
 Get low, get loose, get down on the floor 
 I ain't gonna change I'm not just a stupid boy 
 I'm not lookin' for my one, I'm looking for my right now 
 And baby we just way too young, too young for me to settle down. 
 I know what I'm doin' love. Keep that game just trust me. 
 I'm stupid, so please give me brain and afterwards just fuck me. 
 I do everything I want to. 
 I wish I would've known what you could do. 
 You think that everything that is said is true 
 I ain't gonna change, Nah I ain't gonna change for you 
 Get low, get loose, get down on the floor 
 Drink up till you can't think anymore 
 Get low, get loose, get down on the floor 
 I ain't gonna change I'm not just a stupid boy 
 I'm tryin' cut you wanna what? 
 I'm trying to cut you wanna what? 
 I'm tryin' cut you wanna make love, make love 
 I'm tryin' cut you wanna what? 
 I'm trying to cut you wanna what? 
 I'm tryin' cut you wanna make love, make love 
 Get low, get loose, get down on the floor 
 Drink up till you can't think anymore 
 Get low, get loose, get down on the floor 
 Get low, get loose, get down on the floor 
 Get low, get loose, get down on the floor 
 I ain't gonna change I'm not just a stupid boy 
 (Stupid boy)
