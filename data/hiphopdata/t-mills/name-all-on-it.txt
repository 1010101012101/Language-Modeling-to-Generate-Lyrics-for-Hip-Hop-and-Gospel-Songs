 And the watch on my wrist same color as it 
 Hands up with your cups, we about to go in 
 Bottoms up it's goin' down

 Drinks in the air like I don't give a fuck 
 Everybodies sippin' the goose, they on zoom 
 Now, I'm gonna beam her heavy like vroom.

 Told you 3 shots ago to slow down 
 Nights in my house and nights on the town 
 Make a movie, we can do it how we doin' it right now, baby

 Valet pull it in the lot for me

 Everything lovely, got no budget
