I go so in that I ain't even out yet. 
 When my record drops, I'm gunna cop some new outfits. 
 Play a couple shows. keep my presidence up. 
 I'd like to say I'm sorry to every girl I didn't fuck. 
 I'm kinda pissed off now, so let me tell you what. 
 Every now and then I do drugs for the fuck of it. 
 Tryin' to be a nice dude. Try to keep my mind right. 
 Always be a young fav. try and live that high life. 
 All I do is smoke weed, chill, and make cool songs. 
 Kickin' with your girlfriend. Prolly last an hour long. 
 I be postin' twitpics. See I keep my high strong. 
 'Cause I'm on the full charge, I be on my iPhone. 
 Gotta keep my friends around, they know how to party right. 
 I just turned twenty one. Find me on a Friday night. 
 Find me on a Friday night, Friday night. 
 Find me on a Friday night, Friday night. 
 Find me on a Friday night, Friday night. 
 Find me on a Friday night, Friday night. 
 I'm in LA, everyday, puttin' time in. 
 You watch me like a g-shot girl, come be my diamond. 
 We don't have to go out, you and I can dine in. 
 Give me all that pussy; open up and I will dive in. 
 Girls play me when they're drivin'. You hate 'cause hoes be viben. 
 I wouldn't fuck with favorites. I'm sure it could get violent. 
 Play you like a violin, I'm good on the strings though. 
 Girls be like he's hot but he's cuter when he sings though, 
 I wonder if he's single. It don't matter I been drinkin'. 
 We ain't gotta fuck now, we got the whole weekend. 
 Find me on a Friday night, Friday night.
