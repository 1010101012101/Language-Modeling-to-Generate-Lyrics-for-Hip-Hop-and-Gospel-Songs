Settle down, settle down, settle down 
 Girl it's all over your face, there's someone taking my place 
 Guess that's something that I'm dealing with now 
 I guess there's nothing I can do now 
 I see you in the city 
 Do they know you're with me 
 Oh, you're with me baby 
 Girl you're with me baby 
 'Cause baby, close just isn't close enough 
 Maybe my passion just ain't enough 
 I can feel that you love me (Ooh) 
 I can feel that you love me (Oh) 
 Baby, baby, I'm not listening 
 Maybe I just don't got what you need 
 I can feel that you love me no 
 I can feel that you love me no more
