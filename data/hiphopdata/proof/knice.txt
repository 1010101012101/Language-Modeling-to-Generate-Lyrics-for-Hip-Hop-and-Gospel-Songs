 What up Detroit, 
 I'd like to welcome everybody to the, 
 First Annual Detroit Hip-Hop Recognition Awards. 
 Secondly I'd like to thank you for coming out 
 And supporting all of our events this year, 
 Especially the Awards show, 
 That means a lot to us. [Proof 1] 
 The vision behind the Award show, 
 Is to recognize our own, 
 Talents, feats and accomplishments, 
 Both locally and nationally. 
 With the community a part of the success of people like, 
 Eminem, D12, Obie Trice, Slum Village, Fat Cat, 
 Sick Notes, Fat Killers, Almighty Dreadnaps, 
 Raw C and Silent Riot, just to touch on a few. 
 The first award we'll be presenting tonight, 
 Is the Hip-Hop Recognition Award [Proof 2] 
 This Award is to recognize 
 The individual for outstanding support of Detroit Hip-Hop. 
 When I think of that, 
 One person stands out without a doubt. 
 From the days of the Hip-Hop shop, 
 To the days of multi-platinum record sales, 
 You'll see this guy on MTV Wednesday night, 
 Then you'll catch him at St.Andrews Hall Friday night hosting a battle. [Proof 3] 
 He's been around the world, 
 And still finds time to get back to the city. 
 That being said, it's both a pleasure and an honour, 
 To present the first Annual Hip-Hop Recognition Award [Purple Pills starts playing], 
 To none other than my man, Big, Proof! 
 (Proof 1) 
 Pssh, Damn man, 
 My city love me, I love my city man. 
 I feel like I'm lettin' 'em down, 
 I done so much, 
 But don't feel like I've accomplished, nothin' at all. 
 (Proof 2) 
 Hip-Hop... 
 I remember when me 'n' Hip-Hop first fell in love man, 
 Detroit and Hip-Hop, damn, pssh. 
 (Proof 3) 
 Psh, eh. 'Cause I ain't changin' for shit. 
 I'ma always be me
