 I Get High... 
 And I pass it to my people 
 I seen my homeboy there with a twenty sac 
 I said homeboy yo could you give me that 
 He said yes he give me time give me two dimes 
 Better catch it with ya next time 
 I said yo I need it now I'm trying to get high 
 He said (??) I'm trying to pass by 
 I said no time for that git up what I did 
 Bust his head with a brick that's what I did

 I said it's like that yo I said it's like that
