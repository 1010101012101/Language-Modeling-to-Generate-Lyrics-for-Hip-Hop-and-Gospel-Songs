(Proof) 
 Niggas bite what they can't be 
 The rich throw what they can't eat 
 Niggas you ain't sweet 
 Coughin and gaggin 
 Often I'm braggin 
 Got a big dick to stop my pants from saggin 
 Waggin your tail like a fag in the jail 
 Keep _on the fucker like weed bags in the mail 
 Empty you vein like a sword to flesh 
 You niggas rap about nothing like lord finess 
 (This is bugz) 
 (Bugz) 
 Let me know 
 You niggas was shoot or start a scrap 
 You think they want to shoot? 
 Ill put a bullet through they starter cap 
 This a about every niggas that I beat up 
 Stomped unconscience 
 Smacked with tha heater 
 Fuck you 
 Bugz don't give a fuck about your feelings 
 I blow your shit out like I gun hustle simmons 
 So hide your knot when you walkin' up my block 
 Niggas smack you with the glock 
 And take the money out ya sock 
 (2x) 
 Know to act a fool 
 And wild out when we buzzin 
 Always rumblin 
 Roudy niggas dirty dozen 
 Cold blooded but album hotter then a oven 
 You want beef? what niggas start sumtin 
 (Proof) 
 Its proof the total package 
 You total wackness 
 The fact is 
 You need a life time of practice 
 I'm active bouce in the coupe 
 To the _ 
 Found the foutain of youth 
 ?Mudon? is countin' on proof 
 _ Survival blaze _ 
 Before armageddon snatched the prof 
 Out the bible 
 Kill a rival with the impact of a rifle 
 And ring the blood out ya 
 Before_ crypt and my disciple 
 (??) 
 Man lemme tell what type a nigga I am 
 I'm the type of mutha fuckin' that write rhymes that kill niggas 
 I'm the type of nigga that niggas can't fuck with 
 You know what I'm sayin' that what type of nigga I am 
 (Bugz) 
 You the type write away gone write a million rhymes a day 
 Come back around the way and sound the same ol entire way 
 Bugz will grab a brew and drink a proof from mary j 
 And bust a freestyle that sounds better then yo tape 
 You style is bitchy, I have a harder time with missy 
 Yo whole set up sucks like monica lewinsky 
 I can cop a seed and read a dictonary first 
 And kill you with a rap full of words 
 I just learned!
