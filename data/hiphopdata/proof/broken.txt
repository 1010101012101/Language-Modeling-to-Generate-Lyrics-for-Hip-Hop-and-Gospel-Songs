 I've been summoned to give you a hurting truth 
 So you bound to get addicted the second I'm in the roof 
 I think its bout time I get loose 
 So you can get a realisation in your mind of what a soldier can do 
 A trained professional, I studied the art of words 
 With the (??) of a predicate makes my actions absurd 
 Take a breather I'm sprinting on (??) man 
 I've (??) seventy miles and they close to my (??) 
 Journalist ya hear it that's one hell of a title 
 Well a (??) and ill join your choir (??) 
 Life signs get vital and violations I'm made to attack stews get blazed that (??) 
 And back in our days getting fucked is a common practise 
 If you know what I knew that's (??) 
 Revolve six shots I choose to be automatic 
 And make a hot sixteen bars something to rap with 
 (Proof and Journalist) 
 Proof: Getting broke up 
 Journalist: For fucking with killers out in the (??) 
 Proof: Don't choke up 
 Journalist: For saying some shit that you didn't mean 
 Proof: Glad you woke up 
 Journalist: 'Cause there's no way you could ever see a man living reality while you live in a (??)

 I'm just an average cat 
 Born in the back of a black hatch back with a (??) and (??) 
 And if you can't appreciate that then you can just scrap it out with this mac 10 
 I talk shit 'cause I can, pretty smart guy with ignorant (??) and awful quick with his hands man 
 In other words what I'm sayin', don't ever fuck with a man with a match and aerosol cans stuck in his pants 
 Get a life, get a hustle, get a job, get a meal, get away from me, quite chasin me, get a deal 
 Girls tell me that I seem conceded, so here's your confidence back, along with some game you seem to need it 
 I had a fag slapped 'cause he came up to me with his backpack and said my albums was wack 
 'Cause it wasn't abstract, that's that (??) from before 
 He got mad 'cause he couldn't take a picture with me after the show 
 I said yes you put your ego in check, we don't make threats and hide behind a email address 
 Ask hex we'll fine you, show up to your office in (??) and put a hole in ya, big enough to throw a swine through 
 I'm a first round draft pic, spittin' fire at you half wits meltin plastic glasses to ashes 
 I can master any craft crafted, hotter than acid, give me a beat and I'll give you a classic

 Everybody light your lighters, Big Proof I write the (??) snipe the biters 
 Blow your chest to bits, to get rid of you like (??) did professor (??) 
 Ain't no (??) than the award award lord who gone knock me down 
 Bitch I'll make your punk ass fall of like (??) 
 Who gone stop me now, I'm doper than the veins on Bobby Brown 
 Break a niggas neck round and round, puff a pound 
 No equivalent illegitimate (??) make them shit a brick 
 Illiterate counterfeit style soakers 
 Please don't put these miles open Flash! 
 Now they miles broken, the flame is hot the names is got to stop 
 The fame is not to sustain the spot to plot 
 In the battle Proof not name the drop 
 Iller than the trigger finger that was aimed at Pac 
 X6 
 Heartbeat broken
