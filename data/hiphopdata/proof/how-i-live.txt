 How I live 
 My michrophone is my outlet 
 To project my style and see how loud the crowd can get 
 No non-sense this is how you need to be livin' 
 Dude this is the life we show improve on each and every move 
 We need some money smokeing bitches to clear our vision like visine 
 And a 40 of O-E for the I.V. 
 So gimmie gimmie 'cause I'm livin' for the fame 
 And I ain't leavin' till I get all that I can and then some 
 (Monoxide Child) 
 I see it tatted on you're back and you're arms 
 And I'm a static you a deal to throw what's killin' you're moms 
 I know you're pops don't understand he thinks you're buildin a bomb because you sit up in you're room and every word you sing along 
 And it seems every word comein outta you're mouth is raw 
 And the truth is they don't have a clue what's goin' on 
 If they would just shut the fuck up give me a listen then they could hear it all in my voice exactly how I'm livin' 
 That's how I live 
 Wildein on the streets that we live 
 That's how I live 
 Tryin' to take as much as I give 
 That's how I live 
 Planttin fantasies in you're kids 
 That's how I live 
 Don't be actin' like you know who this is 
 (Hats how I live) 
 (Jamie Madrox) 
 How I live 
 Tinted windows on suv's I'm smokein 
 Purchesed from grammar and words spoken 
 Uh hustla I was born and raised 
 With the knowledge that you gotta do what you gotta to get paid 
 Can't respect game 
 I'll see you on the grind 
 Same heart same passion it's my three of a kind 
 Its TWIZTID and yuh boy proof from the dirty dozen this shit was destined to happen don't ever say it wasn't 
 (Proof) 
 Please believe it we sit and re-think it 
 Spit flames just blow you're mind and re-heat it re-seaded 
 Slim nov for cons fifty knee beezy 
 And necro jigga its d tweezy 
 Tiwztid we bees the misfits 
 Keep squeezin bisquits 
 Street clean the district 
 This means restricted 
 Family nah ambity time 
 You cross one of them you cross me I'm layin you down 
 (Monoxide Child) 
 Affiliated with sum folks that most of y'all ain't really heard of its keepin' me secret just like a murder 
 With blurred vision I'm undercover like burn victims witta temper like a pitbull waitin my turn sick em' 
 Lickin' my chaps why you sit in the same spot like street sighns while I resurect the whole east side 
 That's how I live and you can love it or leave it 
 But for you to do what I do it'd take you're whole life to achieve it 
 (Proof) 
 My cousins from other mothers they dozens they brothers of us mother that icp be feared recoverd that gang among us 
 Pac and big is the world 
 Wipein balde exhaust 
 Tryin' to repair the damages and managin they j and ob 
 So wish to esham 
 Detroit in these palms 
 We tryin' to get back to these local cats to point where there from 
 So I spit it how I'm in it a minute how I spit it forever walked in it let's get it how we live it its good
