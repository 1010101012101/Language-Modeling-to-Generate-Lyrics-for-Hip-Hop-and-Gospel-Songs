Yo flash back to my forgotten past 
 High off my rockin' hash 
 I put my face inside a stocking mask 
 I put a gun in a purse 
 And run in a church 
 Rob a piece one and the first 
 To come with the worst 
 Now for a piece a bit scarier 
 Than a pit terrior 
 Camoufalge an assassin's well lit area 
 I'ma die at the flesh 
 Conducting your death 
 Killing that bitch ass noise just thumping my chest, yo 
 When your dad come blast a magnum and rob 'em 
 Call him a tigeress (?) psychiatrist with problems 
 I need help and I'm ready to leave hell 
 Having deep felt nightmares and still sleep well 
 I'm the beginning like sex and sperm 
 Seduced by ?? 
 And affects his germ 
 A lesson learned 
 With these stress filled nerves 
 Stand in hell but naked while my fesh just burns 
 To the bone 
 Don't stop when it's on 
 Microphones without the metradome 
 Watch me stretch your dome 
 Easily it's done D12 we do this we flow like water 
 Slaughter your grandaughter 
 You can't end this particular brand water 
 Vehicler man slaughter 
 My dick's in your grandaughter 
 I'm back to tell y'all 
 How we spell y'all 
 Expell these D12 one-to-the-dozen 
 Slim shade made good 
 Came back in hood 
 I almost messed up on my and slurred to the judge 
 Said I don't care about your court room 
 I snort shrooms 
 Yeah I crush 'em up like motrin (?) 
 Devoting 
 Tear your life abortion 
 A portion of my freestyle brain cells 
 Make it rain hell 
 And tim westwood 
 Put your best foot 
 Forward and get fucked up by this clique 
 It's d12 and we make more noise than hell!
