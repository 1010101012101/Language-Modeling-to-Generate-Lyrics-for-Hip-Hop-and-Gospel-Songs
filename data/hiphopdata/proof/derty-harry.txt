Face to face you got no heart 
 When I blow sparks you lean on me like Joe Clark 
 My mind is so dark 
 It's superficial 
 Nuclear Missile 
 Hit your body and your bones and not loose the grissle 
 Proof's official, D12 trademark 
 A man with no-S-big braveheart 
 Y'all ain't even listen 
 No-S-big backwards is Gibson 
 Mel Gibson bravehearted 
 Now on to my mission 
 And since there ain't no failure 
 I promised God to commit homicide to niggaz wantin a free ride 
 Like the Amistad 
 I'm alive 
 And just starting Anger Management Tour like bionic live 
 Part of ya mind 
 Dyin' to ride 
 Like Bonnie and Clyde 
 Influenced the greatest 
 Like Ronnie and Todd 
 It ain't no problem too hard 
 My solo like Dolo 
 Been gettin' it 
 Like I ain't been shittin' it! 
 (Chopped) 
 In high school of course I was the best in the lunchroom 
 Don't make me get up out my seat bitch 
 And punch you 
 I freestyle for fun but write for wealth 
 I'm so dope nigga even bite myself 
 I rap and will rappify you 
 Blasting iron at a baptist choir 
 And then at the black Messiah 
 We gat for hire 
 To let the techs growl 
 Put something in your body worse than the West Nile 
 I was born out of test tube glass 
 I suggest you blast nigga 
 Or catch some flesh wound fast 
 I ain't met a man that could wrestle gats 
 I'm right behind the top rappers like a Neptune track 
 Ya L.P.? 
 I slept through that 
 Now guess who back 
 Unless you strapped with a vest and two gats 
 I suggest you pack 
 I'll spread you flat then rescue rap 
 Hit your body so much that your flesh won't match 
 Mothafucker! 
 Fuck Osama for bombing in the racing buildings 
 I'll bust him and hide him like Jason Williams 
 (I heard Bizarre and D12 be raping children!) 
 Cut the hype dyke, I'm trying to make a million 
 Take this pill then call me when you sober up 
 Turn the dyke from glad to ?? make them hold my nuts 
 Seldomly seen, Elvis the King 
 But it's Em that's got these kids nailed to the screen 
 I held the team, I-F 
 I got something on my chest that's hard to digest 
 I hear the streets talk and sing 
 Offering 
 I'm checking my weapon 
 They mad 'cause I'm flossing bling 
 I lost my steam but a demon in human flesh hyped me up 
 Now my team is tightly cut 
 So sugar sugar, salt salt 
 If you didn't get off it's not my fault 
 The dog is back in y'all niggaz!
