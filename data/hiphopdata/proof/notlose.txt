(Repeat 2X) 
 There's nothing, there's nothing 
 There's nothing, no there's nothing 
 Won't lose it, can't lose it 
 There's nothing but this music 
 (Proof) 
 My mind is broke, too many lines of coke 
 Open mind for beefin, no reason I'ma choke 
 Time to quote somethin' you never heard 
 Pour my heart when I talk and spit it with every word 
 We ain't playin' no more, sayin' no more 
 No games no mourn, on the grind and we came for yours 
 In a four-double, Billboard trouble 
 This industry ain't ready for no more rebels 
 Kill at will, with the will to kill 
 Keep it real with steel, these pills'll feel 
 Proof for poppin', they used to joggin 
 I take out your block cause my future callin 
 Don't confuse it y'all, I used to brawl 
 (Pop pop, pop) Till your producer fall 
 Who's involved? They don't wanna do nothin' 
 Whoop style, I make 'em all move some'n 
 Clap the mag up, back the gas up 
 Leave 'em scrapped and smashed up, then wrapped in plastic 
 Ask the hood, this the platinum classic 
 Now quit the yackin bitch and pass the acid, c'mon 
 (Chorus: King Gordy) 
 What they want right now is a nigga with nothin' to lose 
 - Oh nothin' to lose 
 He got no shame in his game about the stuff that he do 
 - Oh the stuff that he do right now 
 Jump off stage right now nigga start punchin a fool 
 - Oh punchin a fool 
 Y'ALL BITCH, that's why we ain't fuckin' witchu! 
 - We ain't fuckin' witchu, no no 
 (Proof) 
 Hit the metal with devilistic tongues 
 Just frontin for the ghetto kissin' misfits to hum 
 Along with red and yellow biscuits to munch 
 Just think before you was never meant to come 
 Forever rich and dumb, brawl out any day 
 You heard Slim, we some all out "Renagades" 
 To the end of days, put the scare away 
 Who better than D12? That's a sin to say 
 Can you follow this? Y'all swallow shit 
 Of politics, I like the {?} wrist 
 Taste the motherfuckin dust in this laced blunt 
 Take the world with me fool nigga like Pacewon 
 Ain't none ready slapbox for kicks 
 Pack box to spit and smack cops with dick 
 This is narcotics and dark knowledge that's symbolic 
 Sin sonic demonic and my heart's rotted 
 Make plans, on insanity sands 
 I'm like damn, too much in me Incredible Man 
 And I got a Grammy to chant in enemy land 
 I'm bustin' off on your block like Yosemity Sam 
 (Proof) 
 Uh, sittin' in here with a blunt and a ice cube 
 Plottin with Satan, to snatch guys light fuse 
 Didn't like school, I never liked you 
 I'm burnin Bibles while I'm sniffin on this white glue 
 Fight, dudes, blacks to white fools 
 Then act cocky, I'm Rocky, shit I might lose 
 What I got it I'm 'bout it 'bout it, about it 
 Lonely in life or see Christ without it 
 Victory is meant to be 
 Where my father has been has been a mystery 
 But I don't give a fuck, I'ma live it up 
 Gettin' drunk, get in clubs and I'm sellin off prescription drugs 
 And I miss you Bugz! I'm almost steady now 
 Proof is here, the world ain't ready now 
 If you gay you gay, you straight you straight 
 You violate today in the mistake you make, hey 
 Are you swallowin? Hey lil' finger pop 
 Don't need a greasy college to see you drop 
 Proof the king of bars hit the pretty coffin 
 I'm like a sucker punch (why?) 'Cause I ain't seen it often 
 Genius artist, so retarded 
 Broken hearted, my soul's like a open target 
 And I'm ready to leave Earth 
 You step to my death next year on my T-shirt 
 (King Gordy) 
 That Derty Harry, well well 
 King Gordy, well well 
 Dirty Dozen, WELL well 
 Fat Killer, Fat Killer!
