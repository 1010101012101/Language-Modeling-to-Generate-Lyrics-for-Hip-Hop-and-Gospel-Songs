(Proof) 
 Singular in the mind, I'm who you would construction 
 Amaze it in vocab, unique good production 
 Pilots, now it's revenger for real one 
 One in the million drastic with verbal nastics 
 Radical back you go and askin what you rappin' fo 
 Inferity since you relieve factually that you wack to me 
 Why you strive to be the best out them all 
 I cut your thigh off down to your toe 
 You still wanna flow now come on use your head 
 How you gon kick it with only one leg? 
 I reckon that all bad MC's didn't have the reas 
 I turn your juice to peoples and to dead batteries 
 Elementz the four energies to sink your ship 
 Put a brain up in your anus and you still couldn't think of shit 
 Smartass, your wack lines ain't harmin me 
 I provoke you joke ass rappers to stand up and make comedy 
 Test the midwest and who's steppin up 
 Rippin off your ears won't make you def enough 
 The best of like vestor, the referee can't see the pressure 
 Here comes the loony ass professor 
 Chill nigga, naw it's me nigga 
 Best to ask Tommy 
 'Cause he'll figure... it 
 Just don't pay to be bad 
 So grab your pen and pad 
 And jet back to the fuckin' lab 
 Whos that the battle king 
 Take 'em to the battle scene 
 Watch the rappers scream... 
 Whos that the battle king 
 Take 'em to the battle scene 
 Watch the rappers scream... 
 Now Whos that the battle king 
 Take 'em to the battle scene 
 Watch the rappers scream... 
 Now Whos that the battle king 
 Take 'em to the battle scene 
 Watch the rappers scream... 
 (Proof) 
 You wanna battle, what? That puts me in a better mood 
 So now I won't stop like a bus driver with an attitude 
 Walk a slick trail watch me outboxin you swarm 
 But that ain't hittin like an armless boxer 
 You have no technique offcourse they sleep 
 You can rhyme all day ask six quarters an admit your weak 
 Rhyme for rhyme you can bet ya 
 That ain't a damn line predictable 
 Call the psychic network 
 I'm out to foldin now I told you crystal clear 
 Guilletine style, parallel to Wolverine 
 I've seen pain, check my brain 
 Exclusive, too abusive, comin' from the westcoast 
 Don't make that ass ruthless 
 You can hang but ya hung 
 That shit you said was fake 
 A bootlegger must got your tongue 
 Here's to tell you wannabes who tryna rap 
 "Yo Proof man you're incredible" 
 No I'm better than that 
 Practice the tactics 
 That's a bad thing 
 So now you's a fake bitch like a drag-queen 
 Weak cats who dream Gedini and trickle Houdini 
 The problems in your god complex check your colbelini 
 Scope this, these wack niggaz can't get with me 
 Take a hard MC make him yellow like Kid Capri 
 Shit we was your top notch 
 And don't need to brag about the past now we out to prof box 
 Like Stephen King with the butcher knife I stab your story 
 And now you bitch ass niggaz runnin' back to the laboratory 
 Remember that (echos) 
 Wuch you know about weak emcess huh? 
 Wuch you know about crackers and cheese 
 Mk 
 Strait for the 9 izzle 
 Izzo, I'm izzi... without a doubt
