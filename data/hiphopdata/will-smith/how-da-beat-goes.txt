 Thought my reign would end well now I'm rubbin it in 
 I'm back yes yes yallin

 You seen me with denzel and russ crowe 
 But yo the movies just a chick on the side I'm in love with the flow 
 Time off to be an oscar nominee now 
 Back to the M-I-C to emcee now 
 Rockin' the ol heads blazing the youth 
 Only rapper had the president raising the roof 
 Check the tape checkmate 
 Its one mission 
 Make your move 
 Don't fight submission 
 To dawn to dusk 
 We on a truss 
 Just don't miss the bus 
 To jam on with us

 A hip hop superhero 
 A ?? 
 Cape or a suit 
 Hit the studio 
 Every year or so 
 And escape with the loot 
 On my down time straight to the links 
 I could pack a dance floor a movie theatre or truck from ?? 
 On Christmas - mom and wife douse 'em with ice 
 Aol - search will smith thousands of sites 
 And at the club- hands clappin toes tappin 
 Sucka I'm the greatest thing ever happen to rapping (in ali voice) 
 Best shape of my life destined to show ya 
 No scrapes or fender benders lead the game total 
 Free don't move hip hop mogul 
 Philly ain't happy I 
 I be the guy to go 
 The guy to go 
 You know the go to go 
 The mega man that got the whole crew like 
 Damn will done did it again 
 He done stepped up to the plate and he done hit it again 
 Yo get them hands up 
 Throw your hands up 
 Wave 'em like you don't care 
 You like the sound 
 Then let me hear you say 
 It's all night 
 And it's all right 
 Till the sunlight 
 This is how da beat goes on 
 Big Will 
 Tra- Knox 
 So hot 
 This is how da beat goes on 
 Poppin' 
 Rockin' n
