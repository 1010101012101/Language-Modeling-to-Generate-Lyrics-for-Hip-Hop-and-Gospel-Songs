Uh there we go 
 Let me go and jig this thing on out 
 Go ahead baby you got it 
 Big Will raising the roof raising the roof 
 Show him how to do it Will 
 Observe the high roller 
 Mic controller 
 Number one hip hop son 
 Call me solar 
 Why 'cause I shine 
 Praise the Big Willie I'm 
 Raised in Philly I daze and thrillin' ya 
 Don't be silly ya can't see me 
 Again I'm killin' ya on MTV 
 Just get with it my friend (Damn another award) 
 That kid done did it again (Oh my Lord) 
 The fantastic 
 Boombastic 
 Getting ten times hotter than any you other cats get 
 Practice 
 You lack this 
 I'm the real McCoy 
 First with Jeff I was startin 
 Then with Martin I'm a Badboy 
 See more green than David Bantha 
 More juice than Tropicana 
 You hawking me like Atlanta 
 Emcees just flee they rightfully concerned 
 Big Will wants the mic back it's my turn to burn 
 Verse two verse two (blaze 'em one) 
 I'm back attacking the mic 
 Hype like a Viking 
 Striking like a python 
 Blaze like Jon 
 A hip-hop icon emcee radical 
 Back on track from my rap act sabbatical 
 Nine point six on the ricter 
 Kicked her, ears so slickta 
 Chicks quickta flip the 
 Bright glance and the tight pants for the slight chance 
 Big Willie can we get one dance 
 Why yes you may and I'm just saying 
 That dress you playing is a okay an 
 This is your chance for at least it could be 
 For you an you girlfriend on the dance floor menage boogie 
 On the scene I fronts and dashing fashion 
 Lost my cream once, now I'm stashin cashin 
 Countries and currencies like a true Don 
 It's a new time and its mine watch me shine 
 The way I blaze through the days and nights 
 How I deal with the craze my momma raised me right 
 Whether I'm on stage or in the studio booth 
 A hundred proof raisin the roof raisin the roof 
 (And Y'all know) 
 Can't nobody rock a crowd like me 
 (She knows) 
 Can't nobody make it bounce like me 
 (He knows) 
 Can't nobody get it hot like me 
 (You know) 
 Y'all need to stop cause ya can't see me 
 (Y'all know) 
 Can't nobody rock a crowd like me 
 (E knows) 
 Can't nobody make it bounce like me 
 (She knows) 
 Can't nobody get it hot like me 
 (Y'all know) 
 Y'all need to stop cause ya can't see me 
 (Blaze 'em y'all) 
 Seven continents I bruise all cruise 
 Adidas, kilts, or bamboos and no shoes 
 Eskimos to Aborigines 
 I'll test the flows of the world's emcees 
 I'll hit you out the ball park 
 You just all talk 
 Don't be looking at my script, you can't play my part 
 See I'm a rapper that's an actor 
 You act rap with no heart 
 The way that I compose those flows like Mozart 
 Gets something like a symphony, when I'm orchestrating em 
 Ever since the days of me and Jeff at the Paladium 
 All my life I've been the cream of the crop 
 Shopping a dream now I got a crop full of cream 
 I raise mics for the flow of it, you know the show of it 
 Not the Benz 600 four door of it (keep it real yo) 
 I'm a rhyme regardless of earning 
 Long as my heart keeps yearning 
 I gots ta keep burning 
 (Y'all know) 
 Can't nobody rock a crowd like me 
 (She knows) 
 Can't nobody make it bounce like me 
 (He knows) 
 Can't nobody get it hot like me 
 (You know) 
 Y'all need to stop cause ya can't see me
