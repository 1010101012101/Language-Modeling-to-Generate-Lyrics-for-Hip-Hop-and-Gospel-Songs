Ladies and Gentleman 
 Thankyou very much for coming out this evening 
 Yeah Thank You 
 Thank You 
 Please take the Dance Floor 
 Uh I would like to welcome you to the Switch remix 
 Now all you got to do is let your body move 
 And just (woo) 
 Vibe the vibe a second, it's a club girl why you arrived naked 
 Hear that, how the veteran glide the record 
 But don't download, go out and buy the record 
 Something sexy about a, 
 Girl on the floor, all her friends around her 
 I mean real clean, ain't gotta touch or nothing 
 It ain't like I like a chick on chick or something 
 Just a sucker for a hot track, 
 Gimme a drink and a chick to tell 'Stop that' 
 Dance is a hop and a clap, flip it round 
 Now bring it on back, break it down 
 Now Switch! 
 I don't want nobody sitting on the wall (Switch) 
 If you didn't come to dance then why'd you come at all (Switch) 
 Heres your chance (heres your chance) 
 Take my hand (take my hand) 
 Do that dance 
 Girl lets Switch 
 I gotta question, I need to ask somebody 
 Why is it that when y'all see me at the party 
 Y'all be looking like 'Ooh he a movie star 
 He ain't supposed to be out on the floor with everybody' 
 But oh wait, whoa y'all forgetting 
 When I was, amateur spitting before the scripts were written 
 First one in, last one out the club 
 Bursting in, passing out in the club 
 Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm 
 Taking you higher like a syringe hittin ya arm 
 Bringing the fire, making you Benz ring the alarm 
 Let me see you clap, spin baby come on 
 Switch! 
 I don't want nobody sitting on the wall (Switch) 
 If you didn't come to dance then why'd you come at all (Switch) 
 Heres your chance (heres your chance) 
 Take my hand (take my hand) 
 Do that dance 
 Girl lets Switch 
 I don't want to see you standing when you look as fine as you (to the left one time girl) 
 I don't want to see you standing when you look as fine as you (to the back one time girl) 
 I don't want to see you standing baby looks as fine as you (to the right one time girl) 
 I don't want to see you standing girl look so fine as you (slide it up front slide it up front) 
 Left right east west up down north south (Robin Thicke) 
 Left right east west up down (Big Will) 
 Look so fine as you baby 
 Keep switchin whether you in your car or kitchen 
 Switch and hittin like it's a brand new dancing religion 
 Chance collision with robin thicke advancing my mission 
 Dancing vision by my man O Money keep switchin 
 I don't want nobody sitting on the wall (nobody on the wall) 
 If you didn't come to dance then why'd you come at all (dance with my mama) 
 Heres your chance (heres your chance) (its ya chance baby) 
 Take my hand (take my hand) (take my hand baby) 
 Do that dance (do that dance do that dance) 
 Girl now Switch baby 
 I don't want nobody sitting on the wall 
 If you didn't come to dance then why'd you come at all (uh ya don't stop) 
 Heres your chance (as fine as you baby) (ya don't stop) 
 Take my hand (as fine as you baby) (ya won't stop/you can't stop) 
 Do that dance (so fine as you baby) (you don't stop/you won't stop) 
 Girl lets Switch 
 Huh Big Will (Switch) 
 Thank y'all very much for coming out this evening (look so fine as you) (Switch) 
 The love that I feel in this room (look so fine as you) (Switch) 
 Is beyond compare (look so fine as you)
