Yo 
 At 17 years old I startin' runnin' the streets 
 Man I had some fun in the streets 
 11, 12, sometimes 1 in the streets 
 By 18 I started seein' the sun in the streets 
 My mom started trippin' on me like "Will you gotta choose your friends carefully" like 
 I trust you but please call me 
 And when you have kids of your own you'll see 
 I'm a be here when all your friends won't 
 But I was busy hollerin' parents just don't understand 
 Now here I am with the family runnin' the lines she ran on me 
 We ain't always see eye to eye but Ma on your principles now I rely 
 You got me tastin' my toes 
 I didn't know 
 When my Momma told me don't go down that road (don't go down that road) 
 But I gotta go where I gotta go 
 So thank you for not tellin' me I told you so 
 I used to roll hard with this dude named Chuck 
 Rollin' in my car with this dude named Chuck 
 My mommy really liked this dude named Chuck 
 She thought that he was really impolite 
 Chuck and me used to roll out faithfully 
 Ineviatably you see Chuck you gonna see me 
 Like we on TV the buzzomest of buddies 
 Share full clothes and money 
 And hunnies flocked like we was players from the NBA 
 Still hurts to recall the day I heard him say 
 To this girl named Maya 
 I was datin' 
 He told her I was a lier 
 Joker hatin' 
 He told her I be cheatin' on women breakin' hearts and grinnin' 
 He told her her life would be better without him in it 
 That's the friend I chose 
 I didn't know 
 When my Momma told me don't go down that road (don't go down that road) 
 But I gotta go where I gotta go 
 So thank you for not tellin' me I told you so 
 Momma used to say take your time young man 
 I ain't gonna always be there holdin' your hand 
 But you'll always know exactly where I am 
 And when I'm not there in my place the lord will stand 
 Will study the world only the wise succeed 
 And when your eyes tell lies your heart should leave 
 You gonna do dirt we all gonna sin but when you realize and apologize and never do it again 
 Ma told me don't rush to get old 
 If you got youth the truth clutched in your hold 
 It's like possibilities too much to behold an emotional shield from life's blustery cold 
 Ma all the stuff was hard you said was hard 
 Childish disregard because my head was hard 
 Now no question to pose 
 I didn't know 
 When my Momma told me don't go down that road (don't go down that road) but 
 But I gotta go where I gotta go 
 So thank you for not tellin' me I told you so
