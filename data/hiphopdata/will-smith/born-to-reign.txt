I believe in God 
 I believe in Destiny 
 Not Destiny in the sense of all of our Exerts being pre-determined 
 But Destiny in the Sense of our ability to choose 
 Our ability to choose who we are and who we are supposed to be 
 Yo Yo YoYo 
 I was Born to reign 
 Point Blank 
 My name to be ecthed in stone 
 My destiny Pre-ordaned 
 Tryin' to live richteous 
 Fightin for life, tis my life 
 That's why I liked on my vices 
 Tightnin the vices of truth on the roofless 
 This is rhyme and the crime and their minds is just useless 
 The path of the poison, the genesis of the genisi 
 YOu and your boyz tryin' to decide, what to write 
 But your hand is a sword and the blade has been forged 
 Young minds gettin' gorged Stakes have been altered 
 By lick or by weed and then hate gets exaltered 
 As art falls to greed, Choices is Made that's the voices is laid 
 On the track, contract, the soldier wage, did you see his new benz, but you're like a syringe now proud of your binge. 
 Got a lot of new friends, got a lot of new ends 
 Bought a house up in the hills frontin shouts to the pen 
 Givin' false accounts of your account's amounts 
 Amounts the fans treason stands to reason since your inception 
 Laced with deception and bred with false affection it must perish 
 From the Terrace I see the fire burnin the streets but I won't shield my eyes to the heat 
 Born to reign 
 I was Born to reign 
 I was Born to Reign
