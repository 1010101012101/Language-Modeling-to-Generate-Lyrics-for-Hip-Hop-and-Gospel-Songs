(Tatyana) 
 Uh, uh, uh 
 Oh, oh yeah 
 Baby 
 (Tatyana) 
 From the moment that I saw you babe 
 All I think about is loving you 
 Every time that you are near 
 I just can't help but stare 
 I'm dreaming of eternity with you 
 So maybe I can 
 1 - (tatyana) 
 Run away with you 
 Imagine all the things we'd do 
 Call my name 
 And make this fantasy for real 
 Run away with you 
 Imagine all the things we'd do 
 Call my name 
 And make this fantasy for real 
 2 - (tatyana) 
 Can't hold it, I can't fight it 
 Want you and I can't deny it 
 It's all about the things you do 
 Boy, you knock me out 
 Can't hold it, I can't fight it 
 Want you and I can't deny it 
 It's all about the things you do 
 Boy, you knock me out 
 (Tatyana) 
 Can you feel the vibes I'm sending, baby? 
 All my energy and thoughts towards you 
 There's now way I could let go 
 Of all these dreams and hopes 
 Anxieties so deep, feelings so new 
 Just maybe I can 
 Repeat 1 
 Repeat 2 
 (Tatyana) 
 Falling for you, this love's a tko 
 Falling for you, baby 
 Falling for you, this love's a tko 
 Falling for you, baby 
 (Will smith) (tatyana) 
 Uh, uh, uh 
 Here it is a groove slightly transformed 
 Again, but with a tatyana ali spin 
 I knew ever since she was ten 
 As fresh prince from back then 
 I had a synch she would win 
 Whatever clique she was in 
 Now she's all grown up not ashley 
 Mad sexy, true but classy 
 She in the fast lane under my wing 
 Kissing the sky 
 Tatyana ali, girl you knock me out 
 (Cause boy you knock me out) 
 Repeat 2 till end
