Damn 
 Womens voice: 
 Hey this is me, I'm not in right now, but if you leave your name 
 And your number, I'll just might think about calling you back. 
 Have a pleasant day. 
 Pick up the phone girl, I know that you home 
 Please don't leave me all alone with the sound of this tone. 
 Come on pick up, pick up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up 
 I know I don't deserve it 'cause of how I messed up 
 But all right cool, sit and listen 
 I'm missing your kiss and now a tear drop glistens 
 I had a bit to drink, kinda threw me 
 Things just happened, she didn't mean nothin' to me 
 You know me baby, I'm still that same man 
 That asked for your hand, and still the same plan 
 Another brother falls by the wayside 
 Another brother falls by the play side 
 I knew ever since I was a kid 
 That I was going to pay the piper for the things I did 
 But now there's no more us, no more we 
 No more nothin', girl, damn and it's all 'cause of me 
 No more late nights watching TV 
 No more talks on the phone till three 
 No more playing in the leaves in the fall 
 No more piggy back rides in the mall 
 No more ice cream cones to share 
 No more sittin' just playin' in your hair 
 No more picnics out by the sea 
 There ain't no more nothin' and it's all 'cause of me 
 Damn, some brothers yeah we huff and we puff 
 'Cause when we're hurtin' inside, we gots to front like we tuff 
 But that's dangerous, to cover hurt with hard 
 Because you still get scared through that feeble facade 
 Then the bonds of your ego, when the shackles of manhood 
 Makes you lose something that's damn good 
 A picture in my mind of us hand and hand walking 
 So alive, now I'm a dead man talking 
 Why can't you just pick it up so we can sit and just talk 
 Why can't I meet you somewhere so we can go take a walk 
 I can't hide, air, land, or sea. 'cause everytme I turn around, there I be 
 When I was with u I felt free, now I'm in a cage called me 
 Now I see, no more us, no more we 
 No more nothin' girl damn, and it's all 'cause of me 
 ***Chorus*** (twice)
