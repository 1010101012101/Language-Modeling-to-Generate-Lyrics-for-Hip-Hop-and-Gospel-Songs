The maestro 
 Nice flow 
 Hot like nitro 
 Cool as ice though 
 That type of docodimy 
 Y'all know it's gotta be 
 Who else could it be but me? 
 Rub your eyes, but hold the big Billy 
 It's dream supreme bean straight from Philly 
 It's the eclectic female attractor rapper slash actor 
 Right back at ya 
 And to the next millennium many come but few are chosen 
 See me servin' like the U.S. Open 
 Another type of hustler listed at Blockbuster 
 Go and ask a movie usher 
 Who is he, he or she 
 SFP, movies CD's, and TV's, but uh uh 
 'Cause the day I take a break from that 
 As I roll where a tank of gas will take me at 
 I used to rock these 
 Red, I rock Z's 
 Now I rock the MB's 
 With twelves and V's 
 Today sun up high 
 In the sky 
 From NY 
 La la me to MI 
 Just cruisin' 
 Where, baby, I don't care 
 Just cruisin' 
 As long as you take me there 
 Just cruisin' 
 Somewhere to clear my mind 
 Just cruisin' 
 Just cruisin' 
 Easy wrote a sixty 
 Flossin' ninety degrees 
 Sony cartridges, ten CD's each 
 Reach to the beach 
 South side leanin' 
 It ain't often I'm off and I'm for the top down 
 Drop down 
 Got me hot now heated up can't stop now 
 What up, cutie, what sure sure is cooking now 
 Yo I know 
 I'm spoken for, can't hurt lookin' no 
 Pop CD's, B-I-G's and Tupac's 
 While cruisin' on the blocks 
 Hittin' the hot spots 
 Got my celly on O-F-F 
 Golden arches got my belly goin' oh yes yes 
 So let's just ease on down ease on down the road 
 No pager roll my hip 
 As I rollin' my whip 
 'Cause today I'm on the solo creek 
 Man, why you think I be workin' all week 
 I'm just cruisin' 
 Where, baby, I don't care 
 Just cruisin' 
 As long as you take me there 
 Just cruisin' 
 Somewhere to clear my mind 
 Just cruisin' 
 Just cruisin' 
 Just cruisin' 
 Where, baby, I don't care 
 Just cruisin' 
 As long as you take me there 
 Just cruisin' 
 Somewhere to clear my mind 
 Just cruisin' 
 Just cruisin' 
 Sun settin' in the S-K-Y 
 Must say I've had the best day I 
 Tryin' to find an exit 
 A place to chill, not too hectic 
 So I can spend some time with Will 
 Let the sun shine to the moonlight clearin' my mind 
 Soul search, see what I find 
 If I'm being the best lover and friend 
 Am I being the best daddy I can 
 I pray I am 
 And I feel good today 
 Reminisce as I'm cruisin' around the way 
 Roll tight passed the park where I used to play 
 Can't think of a better way to spend my day 
 Uh, still findin' my way 
 Still growin' 
 Petrol lowin' 
 Moon soon showin' 
 Gots to get goin' losing the light 
 And the freaks come out at night 
 Just cruisin' 
 Where, baby, I don't care 
 Just cruisin' 
 As long as you take me there 
 Just cruisin' 
 Somewhere to clear my mind 
 Just cruisin' 
 Just cruisin' 
 Just cruisin' 
 Where, baby, I don't care 
 Just cruisin' 
 As long as you take me there 
 Just cruisin' 
 Somewhere to clear my mind 
 Just cruisin' 
 Just cruisin'
