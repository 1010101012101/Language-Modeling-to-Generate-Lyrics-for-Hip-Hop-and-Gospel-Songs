Intro: Uh, Yo, get off me 
 Get off me 
 I can't stop, da da da da da da da 
 I can't stop, da da da da da da da 
 I can't stop, da da da da da da da 
 Get your hands off me 
 Stop tryin' to hold me down 
 Let me just move around 
 Girl somethin' done happened to me 
 Swear to God 
 Somethin' done snapped in me 
 I need the whole floor for us 
 I'm 'bout to bust, mami 
 And its glorious 
 I can't seem to stop my feet 
 You hear my heart beat, digga digga digga digga digga digga 
 Oh lord, I'ma 'bout to pass out 
 But when the night is over I'ma be the last out 
 Sweat pumpin' in my eyes 
 Vision a blur 
 But even though my eyes is closed I see visions of her 
 Un besito mama en mi boca 
 Estoy bien livin' la vida loca 
 Heart jumpin' and pumpin its about to pop 
 But don't tell me nothin' back up 
 I can't stop, da da da da da da da 
 I can't stop, da da da da da da da 
 I can't stop, da da da da da da da 
 The way you press against me 
 You messin' with me 
 The way that dress is fittin' 
 It's got to be forbidden 
 No reason for security, ma 
 Feelin' secure 
 You guardin my body, baby 
 Come on and gimme some more 
 If all these people wasn't in here, flockin around 
 And how you in the middle of the floor, baby knockin' you down 
 The dude who be talkin' bout 
 When I walk in the house cameras like click click click, gizz gizz gizz 
 A damn shame 
 How you do the damn thang 
 Girl you off the damn chain 
 But you 'bout to be tamed 
 Look at you 
 Laughin' and grinnin' and dancin' and spinnin' 
 It wasn't my intention 
 But you got me cringin' my linen, come on 
 Call me a doctor 
 Give me a respirator 
 Look into my eyes 
 Mama, pressure is rapidly rising 
 All around my naked leg, all around my thigh 
 Feels like Ecs. when you next to me getting me high 
 Girl you dancin' honey, that's how I like to play 
 I be Patrick Swaze, you be Jennifer Gray 
 High heels stiletto 
 Sexy straight out the ghetto 
 She fire 
 It's like I'm dancin with the devil 
 Un besito mama en la boca 
 Estoy bien livin' la vida loca 
 Heart jumpin' and pumpin its about to pop 
 But don't tell me nothin' back up 
 I can't stop, da da da da da da da 
 (Baby don't hold me back, can't stop, won't stop) 
 I can't stop, da da da da da da da 
 (Baby don't hold me back, can't stop, don't stop) 
 I can't stop, da da da da da da da 
 (Baby don't hold me back, wont stop, don't stop) 
 I can't stop 
 It's like a dream or a TV show or a cinema scene 
 Brother only dancin' lambada 
 People treating me mean 
 Why they be flippin' and trippin' on me 
 Chasin' me down 
 Grippin' on me 
 Racin' around 
 Disgracin' the sound 
 Got me on the run 
 Runnin' for havin' fun 
 They way they come and attack they act like I had a gun 
 Cops gimme room 
 Stop tryin' to gimme doom 
 They got me like roooooooooom 
 I don't care who it is 
 I ain't stoppin' for no helicopter 
 I ain't no fugitive 
 Bonnie and Clyde alive 
 It's me and my shortie 
 Get from in front of me 
 I don't want to hurt nobody 
 Un besito mama en mi boca 
 Estoy bien livin' la vida loca 
 Heart pumpin' and jumpin' its about to pop 
 Suckers don't come no closer, back up 
 I can't stop, da da da da da da da 
 (Baby don't hold me back, can't stop, won't stop) 
 I can't stop, da da da da da da da 
 (Baby don't hold me back, can't stop, don't stop) 
 I can't stop, da da da da da da da 
 (Baby don't hold me back, wont stop, don't stop) (X3)
