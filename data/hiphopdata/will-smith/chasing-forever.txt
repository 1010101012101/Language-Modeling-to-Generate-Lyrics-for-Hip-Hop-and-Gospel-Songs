Early mornin' wake up 
 Gently with the caress on your hand 
 And that Kimono that I bought you on my trip to Japan 
 Sunshine peekin through the venetian blinds 
 Four years, and like wine, you got fine over time 
 I got a question, if the Prada dressin and the Gucci 
 All got ghost, and the freeze on the Lucci 
 I mean real bad girl, I'm talking rougher than rough 
 Do you think it'd be enough if we just had us? 
 Don't answer quick, think about it 'cause I'm askin for real 
 Gold diggers goin' to hear this song drivin' and crash at the wheel 
 Forever is a long time, so far we gettin' along fine 
 No car I ever drove, no ice I ever saw 
 No music I ever made, ain't nothin' I wanted more 
 We could deal with whatever together 
 Sunshine or that other weather, when we chasin forever 
 I wanna stay with you forever 
 I wanna spend all my life with only you 
 I wanna stay, lets stay together 
 Chasing forever, with only you 
 Chasin forever, a buck-wild endeavor it seems 
 Are we pursuin' somethin' real or just chasin a dream 
 Or casin' the scene 
 'Fore I die I plan 
 To see us holding eternity in the palm of our hands 
 Now as a man, there's certain things I'm lackin for sure 
 But I'm committed to growin' and coming at you mature 
 In the future, I know it ain't gonna be all good 
 But when we feelin' the hurt, if we willin' to work 
 The eight ball will never turn to see us behind 
 Though I ain't no knight, and my armor don't shine 
 My mom said the linchpin of love is trust 
 An taught me monogamy is a monoga-must 
 A plus, for you dinner by candlelight 
 Now don't commit before you sure you understand me right 
 It's a race to a strange place, most see never 
 It's a chase we gotsta make together, forever 
 Now you would think after all my heartbreaks I'd be cruel 
 Hiding behind my ego, evil but no 
 Much the contrary, I'm very much certain 
 You searchin for joy, it's on the other side of hurtin' 
 Finally found a person, worthy of all 
 Instead of pushin me down, you wanna cushion my fall 
 Your eyes could make the sun rise, all the birds sing 
 Seal it with a kiss, bind it with a ring 
 More carats than even Bugs could eat in a week 
 And the ribbon in the sky, close your eyes don't peek 
 I'll tell you what I see in the future 
 A hacienda so cute with, five little kids callin you mom and callin me dad 
 Havin' more good times than JJ had 
 Judging by the look in your eyes, you see it 
 Let no man sever, welcome to forever 
 Chorus to fade
