 All right fellas let's do it 
 (Will) 
 Yo ma we got this thing right 
 It's like makin' me think like 
 It's like fillin' my heart up 
 Not makin' me hazy 
 Just fillin' my mind up with all of these maybes 
 I'm tryin' to figure exactly the thing 
 It's like got me rackin' my brain 
 It's like tryin' to put words to a smile 
 Or like tryin' to figure out... forget it look 
 It's really kinda hard to explain how your smile been burnt in my brain 
 And how your perfume sing a sexy song to my nose 
 And how your finger tips gentle like the petals of roses 
 Maybe it's the way you comb your hair 
 Or maybe it's them stylish clothes you wear 
 Or maybe it's them little things you do 
 Or maybe it's just you 
 I don't know 
 Maybe it's your attitude 
 Maybe it's your point of view 
 Maybe it's the time we spend together 
 Maybe we could do this thing forever 
 Maybe it's your soldier ways 
 Maybe it's your golden gaze 
 Maybe it's the way we blend together 
 Maybe we should do this thing forever 
 (Will) 
 Remember we met with shakin' (?) that first night 
 That was the worst night right 
 Well, I mean we had fun and all 
 Yeah, that's true but 
 You had somebody else and I did to 
 So it felt like karma and fate had formed a team 
 To keep me from the girl of my dreams 
 But in the end I made friends with hope and destiny 
 And then well the rest is history 
 But yo it wasn't easy though trust 
 I mean, tryin' to turn you and me into us 
 You my homie my lover my best friend 
 The white house to the ghetto you blend right in and I dig that 
 I could never imagine this passion I feel 
 I mean couldn't imagine how we could last what I feel 
 But if someone do somethin' to you 
 Shoot girl I might just... 
 Maybe it's your attitude 
 Maybe it's your point of view 
 Maybe it's the time we spend together 
 Maybe we could do this thing forever 
 Maybe it's your soldier ways 
 Maybe it's your golden gaze 
 Maybe it's the way we blend together 
 Maybe we should do this thing forever 
 (Tra-Knox) 
 I must tell you how I love you 
 Maybe you're my soul mate 
 Maybe my best friend 
 You make me and mold me a better man 
 Yes I can believe in loooooove 
 Oh yeahie yeahie yeah oh yeeaahie 
 Maybe maybe maybe 
 Maybe it's your attitude 
 Maybe it's your point of view 
 Maybe it's the time we spend together 
 Maybe we could do this thing forever 
 Maybe it's your soldier ways 
 Maybe it's your golden gaze 
 Maybe it's the way we blend together 
 Maybe we should do this thing forever
