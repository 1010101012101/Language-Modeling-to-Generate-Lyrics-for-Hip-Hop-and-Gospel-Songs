So dad, like did you like have real good friends and potnas when you was growing up 
 Will's dad: I had two real good friends all the way through high school 
 Who you had? 
 Thomas Jones and Jacob Curtis Jones 
 Were they like brothers? 
 Well they weren't brothers they just had the same last name as Jones 
 And everybody thought that I was a Jones too but I wasn't, of course I was a Smith 
 Right 
 But they thought I was a Jones, they called us the Jones boys we were so tight 
 Matter of fact I had a call from one of them 
 Hey Dad listen, check this record out 
 It was a dark night 
 I had just sparked the mic 
 Brought the light 
 To the crowd 
 In Hampton 
 It was amped when 
 I finished with 
 Brand New Funk 
 They were screaming out, "Do Summertime" 
 Some of them was drunk, some of the time 
 I like to chill after the show 
 But tonight, yo I wanna get ill after the show 
 And there she is 
 5 sumthin, short hair, damn she live 
 The girls get thicker further down 95 
 I expressed to her 
 Sought of confessed to her 
 I wanted to get next to her 
 So I suggested to her 
 We roll 
 To suite 110 
 Sweet ones in 
 My room 
 Jeff in one eleven with a friend 
 Then boom boom boom who that? (open the door) 
 Why they do that? 
 Threw back 
 By the noise 
 Some dude and his boys 
 You know them? 
 Your boyfriend? 
 More like an annoyed friend 
 Peep through the peep hole peeped him and all his people 
 That's when Charlie creep through 
 Boy you wanna see who 
 Don't nobody wanna meet you 
 Damn here come the beef stew 
 My beef ain't with you (uh ah) 
 My beef's with Will 
 So see Mack 
 Ease back 
 'Fore your cat get peeled 
 Charlie said, "Any beef with Will is 
 Plenty beef with me and 
 Whenever Charlie get mad 
 He step to the streets he see 
 The end of the story 
 You wonder who survived?
