 When the strangerous, tries to endanger us, 
 Praise me y'all, don't nothin' phase me y'all,

 Of your imagination,

 Black tie with the black attitude, 
 New sound, black Ray-Bans, I'm stunnin' man, 
 New hotness, pitch black, ...? man,

 Leave you hangin' without bringin' you the fun again, 
 Tangoin' with the alien scum again, 
 Mind your manners or the black suits runnin' in... 
 Nod Your Head!

 Galaxy defenders, don't act like you don't remember, 
 Takin' contenders, and provin' they only contenders, 
 Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
