Uh, Uh, I'm Comin' 
 Watch ya back, I'm Comin' 
 Big Will bringin' Y2K 
 Feel the Earth tremble 
 See the skies turn red 
 Eclipses shootin' stars you turned your head 
 Volcanoes erupting, rage in the sea 
 Ain't the second comin' of Christ the first comin' of me. 
 They say if you damn with the Nile it would throw of the rotation of the 
 Earth, well messin' with me is worse. 
 Feel the rain, button up your overcoat 
 Watch the illidef badboy go quote for quote 
 We all want the best, well I'm right here, 
 Ya Lookin' for competition ain't no one near. 
 Y'all in the stands dissin' kickin dirt and missin' 
 My heavenly flows put emcees in hell's kitchen. 
 And I'm so, I'm so, hot, hot y'all burnin up, hot 
 I step in it's like a weddin between hope and Armageddon 
 The hip hop Moses to we headin y'all 
 I'm comin' 
 I'm comin' 
 You can't stop me 
 You can't stop me 
 I'm comin' 
 I'm comin' 
 You can't hold me back 
 I'm comin' 
 I'm comin' 
 You can't stop me 
 You can't stop me 
 I'm comin' 
 I'm comin' 
 When I was born there was rainbow formed 
 With no sun, R.O.Y. G. B.I.V., markin a path for the chosen one 
 An angel, my grandma told me before she died, smart folks don't need to 
 Put no cursin in their rhymes. 
 So from CD to TV to movies back to rhymin' 
 My life stats made Jordan's six rings seem common 
 Y'all hate I retalliate just by being great 
 Big Will the enemy of your mental state. 
 With the same rhyme I used to burn your idol in a battle 
 To subdue you into sayin' look, I don't want to battle 
 MIBW3 my respect black stealth bomba roma radar can't detect that 
 I'm comin' is what I screamed as a teen armed with discipline 
 Faith in a dream, and as the smoke clears, after life's roller 
 Coasters, see who stands puttin' his mike into his holster. 
 I'm comin' 
 I'm comin' 
 You can't stop me 
 You can't stop me 
 I'm comin' 
 I'm comin' 
 You can't hold me back 
 I'm comin' 
 I'm comin' 
 You can't stop me 
 You can't stop me 
 I'm comin' 
 I'm comin' 
 Batton down the hatches and latch the doors 
 You wanna to try to match my wits with yours? 
 3 hits, I hit you, you hit the floor 
 This track is the third hit that's for sure 
 Beat thick, remenising of a bottecelli, 
 I'm like a cheetah hunting out on the Serengeti 
 I got my x-ray vision through all in my way, 
 No plan B, it disracts from plan A 
 Stage splittin in half earthquake style 
 Evacuate the premisis, the hard core nemisis 
 I never miss, my flow never flawed 
 Grab mikes and send electric shock through the cord 
 Quest for the rings, my only weapons intuition 
 My future position determined by past decisions 
 So young George Bush, I'm thinkin' about runnin' 
 Maybe not this time, but trust dude. 
 I'm comin' 
 I'm comin' 
 You can't stop me 
 You can't stop me 
 I'm comin' 
 I'm comin' 
 You can't hold me back 
 I'm comin' 
 I'm comin' 
 You can't stop me 
 You can't stop me 
 I'm comin' 
 I'm comin' 
 You can't hold me back 
 I'm comin' 
 I'm comin' 
 You can't stop me 
 You can't stop me 
 I'm comin' 
 I'm comin' 
 You can't hold me back 
 I'm comin' 
 I'm comin' 
 You can't stop me 
 You can't stop me 
 I'm comin' 
 I'm comin' 
 You can't hold me back
