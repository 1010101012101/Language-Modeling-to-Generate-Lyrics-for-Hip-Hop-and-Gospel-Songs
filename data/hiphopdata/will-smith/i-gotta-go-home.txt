 I'm about to ask you to take me home (take me home) 
 Please stop shakin I got my will breakin 
 Love in jamaica but I gotta go home 
 Ten days I'm in Jamaica workin 
 Ain't had a chance to get out and do too much a nothin' else but a workin 
 It's killin' me 
 Ain't had a chance to get that chicken jerkin 
 Responsibility tasting victory but desire lurkin 
 He callin me 
 I been recordin writing vibin and rhymin 
 Nothin' but heat havent even had a chance to see the island 
 I need that 
 Me and the team we got a dreamer comin' 
 The hot we heard about through word of mouth is club asylum 
 Lets finish up 
 And like the breeze of the seas 
 We arrive at the party 
 Hostess she desiree flirtin heavily with me 
 Got me thinkin' things I really probably shouldn't be 
 Everytime she move she look at me 
 Girl stop shakin you got my will breakin 
 Love in jamaica but I gotta go home (gotta go home) 
 I got my girl waitin I'm supposed to land at eight and 
 If I'm not their then I can't go home (can't go home) 
 Ma you got me bakin I'm about to make a mistake and 
 I'm about to ask you to take me home (take me home) 
 Please stop shakin I got my will breakin 
 Love in jamaica but I gotta go home 
 (Every time she moves) I don't know how to act 
 Came to get my groove on not to get my groove back 
 Her eyes deep enough to swim in 
 She grinnin 
 Her innocence inspire thoughts of sin an 
 Crazy right 
 She got a flower so long and smilin' 
 Her shakin makin' jamaica seem like temptaion island 
 I'm wilin 
 Cause man she hot (what I'm a do) 
 Feeling like (the moment of truth) 
 Making my conscious (loving and move) 
 What's a brother to do 
 Makin' me feen 
 Desiree the jamaican queen 
 Making me hatin' to leave 
 Cause the shakin is mean 
 Wind ya hips 
 Got me going fine to this island miss 
 But I'm monogomous 
 So far y'all 
 Girl stop shakin you got my will breakin

 Sending messages sweet as free 
 Trying to get away but she won't let me
