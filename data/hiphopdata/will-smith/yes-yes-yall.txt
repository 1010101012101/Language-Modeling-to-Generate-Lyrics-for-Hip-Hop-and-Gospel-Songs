Intro: Sonny Cheba 
 Yes 
 At the start of the new jiggyness 
 With the Trackmasters 
 Camp Lo and 
 Willie 
 Gon' give it to ya 
 Know what I mean 
 Lot of macoronis here 
 Check it out for all the 
 Tenderonis 
 Ah ha ha 
 Like Chachi and Joanie 
 Lights camera action 
 The hip-hop attraction 
 Fresh Priggy 
 John Bliggy 
 Player haters been hatin' all my playin' for years 
 Now they seein' they worst fears as I bathe in cheers 
 Parades and accolades 
 All shades and ages 
 It's me the outrageous 
 My zeal contagious 
 The smile inspirator 
 Aspen to Grenada 
 One of the only MC's to say cheese with Schwarzenegger 
 Everywhere I go they know me 
 Planet Hollywood in Paris accidentally spilt a drink upon Naomi 
 Truth of the matter I've been loungin' 
 Livin' it up givin' it up 
 In opulent surroundings 
 Been around the world and I-yi-ya 
 Ain't seen another this fly-yi-ya 
 My attitude pervasive 
 My effervescence 
 Bringing you back to the essence 
 With the... 
 Chorus: Will Smith and Camp Lo 
 Yes yes y'all 
 And ya don't stop 
 Mic check y'all 
 And ya don't quit 
 Repeat 2X 
 Verse two 
 'Bout to slay you worst than the first verse 
 Packin' my purse but yo without one curse 
 I survive in rarefied air where only few can live 
 Thoughts in my brain like that train in the fugitive 
 I pledge allegiance to the soul of the game 
 Stepped away as Fresh Prince came back with my real name 
 A rose by any other still beautifies the room 
 So don't get consumed when a brother's nom de plume 
 It's semantics, but yo it's really good to be back 
 Never racing the rap just lacing the track 
 Not serendipity with me it was a Plan B 
 Gots to have an Oscar standin' next to my grammiesss 
 Plural, mucho, no need to talk though 
 I'm a just do so 
 I'm comin' at ya with the smoothest slickness 
 Behold the style lick of this kickin'... 
 A GQ cover twice 
 This brother's nice 
 Vanity fair you saw me there 
 I discovered life 
 Outside of rap got the cream and all that 
 But kinda left a void in me 
 You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life 
 Said my mic 
 Aight 
 Pump your radio you could record 
 As they place my welcome mat at the music awards 
 Coming through America tinted in high beams 
 Rose petals at my feet like I'm Prince Akeem 
 So to all you player haters while y'all sayin' y'all rhyme 
 Please stop sayin' Jada cause that name's mine 
 I rocked the Philly fade with the divin' waves 
 Yes yallin' till I'm bald like Issac Hayes 
 Bad eyes or greys 
 Back pain or bad legs 
 I'm a get better with age, trust
