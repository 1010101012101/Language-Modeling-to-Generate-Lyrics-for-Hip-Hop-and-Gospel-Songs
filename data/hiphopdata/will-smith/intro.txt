Good evening Ladies and Gentleman 
 I'm Niah Pitson 
 I'm standing in front of the historic Manns Chinese theatre 
 Where thousands literally thousands of fans, journalists 
 And well wishers have gathered merely to catch a glimpse 
 Of the artists formerly known as fresh prince. 
 This album premiere marks Will Smith's return to the world of rap. 
 The long awaited album entitled Big Willie Style has broken sales records everywhere 
 From Bangkok to Madagaskar as we all anxiously await the arrival of the man himself. 
 Oh wait a minute judging from the stir of the crowd
