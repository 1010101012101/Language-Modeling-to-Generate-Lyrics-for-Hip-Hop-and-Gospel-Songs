Yo yo 
 Forget the club today we're playin' the block 
 It's goin' down and it's blazin' hot 
 Jeff pop the new CD turntable joint 
 You just got to get the amps from Boogie get the fan from Rock 
 And then call up Bishgebibble Jims and Pats 
 And tell them we need cheesesteaks for like 300 cats 
 And yo, make sure it's hot or else I'm sendin' it back 
 And get my mic right if I get hyped I might rap 
 Then take the speakers, find a good spot 
 Subs on the bottom, tweeters up top 
 Yo you know where little John lives on the corner 
 The extension cord will run perfectly to his crib 
 And then tell officer Mike to barracade the block 
 Regardless of what car you got, leave it up top, hop 
 You want to come you got to come on your feet 
 Ain't nothin' like havin' a party when it's out in the street 
 Come on 
 9:00 I'm a call my crew 
 At 10:00 we're gonna roll on through 
 I don't know what you gonna do 
 But whatever you do hit the block party tonight 
 All the ladies rollin' up with friends 
 And don't be late or you won't get in 
 Party packed from beginning to end 
 Everybody tell a friend that the block party is tonight 
 It ain't nothin' like havin' a party on the block 
 When everybody knows everybody on the block 
 And everybody on the block 
 Come's to the party on the block 
 And when the sun drop, we don't stop 
 Funny how fast they travel the word 
 A dozen divas from Philly drove in when they heard 
 That there's a block party down in West Philly 
 Come block party with Jeff and Big Willie 
 Stand back 
 Everybody come to see the man rap 
 Jeff's got it *scratch* jam packed 
 Everybody hands in the air 
 Just get your hands in the air 
 Yo Philly (that's where the party's at) 
 D.C. y'all (that's where the party's at) 
 A-T-L (that's where the party's at) 
 West Side (that's where the party's at) 
 Midwest y'all (that's where the party's at) 
 Dirty south now (that's where the party's at) 
 I can't hear y'all (that's where the party's at) 
 Wherever we at (that's where the party's at) 
 9:00 I'm a call my crew 
 At 10:00 we're gonna roll on through 
 I don't know what you gonna do 
 But whatever you do hit the block party tonight 
 All the ladies rollin' up with friends 
 And don't be late or you won't get in 
 Party packed from beginning to end 
 Everybody tell a friend that the block party is tonight 
 Yo and when the sun drops 
 Back in Philly that don't mean that the fun stops 
 All it means is that it's time to turn the lights on 
 All day long I've been plotting on this nights joint 
 10:00 now Jeff is tryin' to hype me 
 Would the Fresh Prince come up to the mic please 
 Hear the crowd cheer brought a little smile out 
 Mic check 1-2 I'm about to while out 
 I know he's old but maybe there's a slight chance 
 I can get my brother hype make him break dance 
 Naw maybe not let me get the crowd jumpin' 
 Let me hit them with the brand new funk or somethin' 
 I'm like Rob Base I wanna rock right now 
 Y'all know who rock the block right now 
 All we need is a mic and a beat 
 And a couple of speakers and some turntables out in the street 
 Come on 
 9:00 I'm a call my crew 
 At 10:00 we're gonna roll on through 
 I don't know what you gonna do 
 But whatever you do hit the block party tonight 
 All the ladies rollin' up with friends 
 And don't be late or you won't get in 
 Party packed from beginning to end 
 Everybody tell a friend that the block party is tonight
