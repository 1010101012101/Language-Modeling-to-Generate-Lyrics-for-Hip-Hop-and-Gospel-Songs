 Uh 
 Check check 
 Yo yo yo 
 Across the room 
 Share a little daze with me 
 Crazy momma how your sent play with me 
 Eyes covered hide in your heart angelic lookin' 
 Thinkin' misinterest but I can tell you're lookin' 
 Face-to-face and eye-to-eye stance with me 
 I didn't even say nothin' I felt you wanna dance with me 
 You pushed me back a little when I kissed your hand 
 Said you was attracted to me truly but you had a man 
 I put my finger up 
 Shhhh 
 Don't say nothin' 
 He ain't here is he? 
 We could play or somethin' 
 He at the crib? Oh 
 I see you live with him 
 What you gonna do get married and have some kids with him? 
 Us could be just a weekend thing 
 Just a weekday thing 
 Just a thing ma 
 Look we could have everything else 
 Before the night let me have you to myself girl holla at me 
 You can have the rest of your life baby 
 Give me tonight

 Baby girl you know exactly what I want 
 No I'm not tryin' to replace your man 
 I just don't like to touch you all over 
 Baby girl you talk secret rendezvous 
 Look at my eyes I'm down with you 
 All I'm tryin' to do is change the view for a moment or two 
 Baby girl I don't wanna think if you had to have 
 Baby I don't wanna be alone 
 You got me all in the zone 
 You could feel my joints baby

 Think of the length of your life as 100 yards long 
 Give me a quarter inch that's all I'm asking 
 Do the math I'm the sun you the earth 
 It's u-n-i-verse 
 And it's the worst since I thirst to taste your nectar 
 I know you got a life momma 
 Trust me I don't wanna bring you life drama 
 I can barely hear myslef think slide with me 
 Dip out the side door take a ride with me 
 Let me hear about (uh) 
 What you think about (uh) 
 What you need to do (uh) 
 The things you dream about (whoo) 
 Your body with but I know where your heart is at 
 *Phone rings 2x* Let it ring ma call him back 
 Wishin' I could stop the clock to make it last with ya 
 Am I goin' to be home alone with a glass slipper? 
 Is it asinine to pretend with another fella? 
 Midnight the story ends like Cinderella 
 You can have the rest of your life baby 
 Give me tonight
