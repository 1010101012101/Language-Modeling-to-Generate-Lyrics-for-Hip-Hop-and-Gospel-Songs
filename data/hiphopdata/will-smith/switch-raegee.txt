Yo mic check mic check 
 Yeah here he go 
 Naw he over here 
 Yeah I heard he got that hot new thing 
 Its called switch 
 Heeeeeeey hey (shake yo body) 
 Turn around now 
 Turn it over and 
 Vibe da vibe second 
 Dis a club girl why you arrive naked 
 Hear that veteran glide the record 
 But don't download got out and by the record 
 Something sexy 'bout a girl on the floor 
 All her friend around her 
 I mean real clean ain't gotta touch or nothing 
 It ain't like I don't like it chick on chick or somthing 
 I'm just a sucker for a hot track 
 Gimme a drink and a chick to tell stop that 
 Dance is a hop and a clap flip it round 
 Now bring it own back break it down 
 Switch 
 Every body dance now 
 Ooh la la la 
 Switch 
 Turn it over and shake ya body 
 Turn around now 
 Turn it over and 
 Ooh la la la 
 Elephant man:

 Get jiggy with it 
 And I don't know the rest sorry you try to understand him
