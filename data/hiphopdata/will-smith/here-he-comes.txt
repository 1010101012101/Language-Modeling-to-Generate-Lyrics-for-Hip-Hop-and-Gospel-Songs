Here he comes, he can rock 
 He can break dance and he can pop 
 He can rap, he can act 
 And if it comes down to it, he can scrap 
 Hey there... here comes Big Will again 
 Here I come y'all, here I come y'all 
 Watch yo' back y'all, here I come y'all 
 For years I been tryin' to rip rhymes and get mine 
 Spit lines, hot like lava this time 
 I don't got a sitcom to bother with 
 Or a time conflict with my sci-fi hits 
 I'm contemplating each statement's wit 
 And I'm concentrating on making hits 
 And I'm fittin' 'em line by line 
 Teeth I grit & I'm tryin' to find the perfect rhyme scheme 
 I'm dreamin' about y'all gleamin, doubt 
 "He's back from actin', he's screaming out 
 How he practiced rap and now he's devout 
 Every album track packs what he's about 
 In the past he passed with passion, old fashioned" 
 Boldly mashing, totally crashing 
 Words up in a disorderly fashion 
 But back to the lab and guess what happened, KABOOM! 
 (Ooh wee!) "Dude's resilient!" Fresh Prince was hot, 
 The movies killed him, wait, hold up, stop! You can rebuild him 
 Lock him back in hip hop while Dude's not filming 
 Shock by the film and the TV money, went from scenes with Uncle Phil 
 To scenes with Sonny, so hard to break free from a guaranteed 20 
 But its done, so come see the MC, honey! 
 Everytime he touch the mic, he closes his eyes and he hope to shine 
 Then like a streak of light, they'd show his name, they'd be like, Ah! 
 ... Hey there, here comes Big Will again 
 ...Here comes Big Will again 
 ...Here comes Big Will again!
