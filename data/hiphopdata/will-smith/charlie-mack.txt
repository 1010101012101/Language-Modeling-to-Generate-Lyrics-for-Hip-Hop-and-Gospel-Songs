Artist: DJ jazzy jeff and the fresh prince 
 (Fresh prince) 
 Everywhere we go, downtown or to a show 
 We have two necessities, charlie mack and our limo 
 He's feared by suckers yet he's loved by kids 
 Pay attention and let me tell you who charlie mack 
 He is our homeboy from around the block 
 He's regarded through the city as the hip-hop cop 
 Height about 6'6", weight about 290 
 Everywhere I go, charlie mack is right behind me 
 He never laughs, never smiles nor sweats 
 He doesn't breaks arms or legs, only spines or necks 
 He once killed a man 'cause he would not let go of his eggo 
 Apollo creed is a sucker, charlie mack could beat drago 
 He could bench about three-hundred pounds 
 The cops all take a vacation, when charlie's in town 
 He's the toughest around, so everywhere that I go, he goes 
 He's charlie mack and he's the first out the limo 
 (Fresh prince) 
 I guess you're wonderin why he's the first out 
 The limo, yo, let me give you this bit of info 
 So you'll know the things that charlie can do 
 And you'll know every single reason why he's down with the crew 
 The limo picks up about a half past six 
 With the radio blastin our latest hit 
 It's me, jeff, ready rock, omar and j.l. 
 Charlie mack is up front as we depart the hotel 
 First we cause chaos throughout the city streets 
 Then maybe stop at burger king for a bite to eat 
 And if somebody gets stupid while we're in the place 
 Charlie cancels his order and bites off their face 
 He's not a troublemaker, in fact, he's a troublebreaker 
 And if somebody gets dumb, well it'll only take a 
 Second or two, after some fools snaps 
 Law and order is restored by my hero charlie mack 
 Wheel off into the limo, and head for the jam 
 Charlie cracks all the knuckles, on both of his hands 
 And when we pull up to the show, the routine is unrehearsed 
 It's just natural that we let charlie hop our first 
 He clears the crowd without sayin' a word 
 Man, that's the loudest silence I've ever heard 
 A lot of times guys test him, by tryin' to bug 
 He just, leaves ring imprints, all over their mugs 
 He's a terminator, a hercules of sorts 
 Man to hell with chess, he likes physical sports 
 You may not have known before but now you know 
 The reason why charlie mack is the first out the limo 
 (Fresh prince) 
 We'd like to apologize to all of our fans 
 But please don't touch us when we're at our jams 
 Cause charlie don't like folks around us when we're doin' a show 
 And if he punches you, uh-oh, better get maaco! 
 Still you weak rap dudes tempers are hot 
 Just because I've got somethin' that you ain't got 
 If you want to get physical, rowdy or try to bomb me 
 I won't get excited, I'll just say, "yo charlie!" 
 You shoulda been kind, you shouldn't have snapped 
 Charlie only hits you once and now you're takin' a nap 
 And when he leaves you decaptitated, crushed in the dust 
 You'll look up, and see your girl in the limo with us 
 You may think that's enough boy but I think not 
 Charlie kick his face again I think you missed a spot 
 I roll down the limo window and yell, "by the way eyes 
 You'll see your girl bucknaked givin' charlie a message" 
 I'm serious, I'm not jokin, no doubt 
 You know how many doubters bones have been broken 
 You may not have known before but now you know 
 The reason why charlie mack is the first out the limo 
 (Fresh prince) 
 Charlie mack... the first out the limo 
 He's charlie mack... the first out the limo 
 In closing, we'd like to say this, to you bustaz 
 If you're skeptical you'll probably get beat up, plus kid 
 Embarassed and laughed at, by all of your friends 
 And if you cross charlie mack it's the beginning of the end 
 Of life as you know it, you might not die, sir 
 But if you're not dead, you'll wish you were 
 But if you still wanna bug out, homeboy let's go 
 You can bug with charlie mack 'cause he's the first out the limo 
 He's charlie mack 
 And he's the first out the limo
