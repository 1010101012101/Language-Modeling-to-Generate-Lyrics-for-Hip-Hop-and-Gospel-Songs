This land is mine, God gave this land to me 
 This brave and ancient land to me 
 And when the... 
 pop 
 uh 
 hot shit 
 pop shit 
 uh yeah 
 c'mon 
 one, two, oh, oh, oh 
 Wooo 
 Yeah 
 mm 
 Now when the pen hits the pad 
 things start happening 
 major freak of nature 
 all pro for splattering 
 my chattering is patterned 
 disease is what I greed 
 in excess of trees 
 a lavish home is all I need 
 Oh 
 The so exquisite prolific gent 
 is here to present 
 my testament at all closed-circuit events 
 Respect the essence and build on my landfill 
 I'm so ill like the film, "Time To Kill" real 
 To real service for clarity in its best form 
 Above the norm but to my culture stay sworn 
 To my duties in-laws 
 To Refresh all y'all 
 with the greatest of songs that can never go wrong 
 To the next now 
 Back and forth realizing 
 what you been missin in lyrical exercising 
 It's no surprising that I'm bringing the goods 
 Swinging the wood like Pujols, 
 Prepare for a new host.

 I'm transmittin live with the hardcore style 
 x2 
 Focus Daily 
 My platform's stacked with choice invoice 
 strapped with a vocal approach considered moist 
 duncan hines rhymes 
 brownie points for the incline 
 I'm inclined to dip your whole shine. 
 Tarnished your garments, pop your ornaments, 
 slice your spinners 
 and embarrass you in tournaments 
 Don't forget when I first stepped on the scene 
 the boisterous, glorious 
 furious with a scheme of themes 
 lethal in fact 
 styles come in stacks of tens 
 Infamous like tapes from Backspin 
 captain of the ship 
 buckaroo banzai 
 master of the sword like Li Mu Bai 
 In it for the cash, and the flash, and the gusto, 
 must flow impressively to rake in the dough 
 Take it all in breathe and stop. 
 Take a minute to reflect as I take it from the top

 I'm headed for the Triple Crown 
 World renowned 
 All purpose for the sprint 
 breakin shit up into fragments 
 The dude, quick to eat up your food, 
 and rude manners, 
 Kill?? with my daily planner. 
 The unflappable, hard like granite 
 granted with the gift that'll spread across the planet. 
 Lace the future with sound like '89. 
 '99 the last year hip hop had it's time. 
 (true dat) 
 Advertise myself, but never dramatize 
 like Homicide. Some will rise on my social life. 
 I'm well-spoken like speakers at charities 
 Narratives that'll give pop off and shattering 
 (woo) 
 Straight action packed jumping through windows. 
 Car bombs and hoes and beats that explode
