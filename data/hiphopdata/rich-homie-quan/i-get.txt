A lot of times 
 I be having a lot on my mind right 
 So I sit back on my bed, and look up at the ceiling 
 'Cause I feel like, this shit ain't for me 
 It may seem like life don't love you no more 
 I done had dreams like that felt so real I thought I was woke 
 Sometimes I feel like I wanna give up with no hope 
 Why does it feel like a nigga fucking with me 'cause of what I do? 
 I get the picture 
 I get you niggas 
 I get money, I get bitches 
 I get 100's, I get 50's 
 I get checks over a 20 
 I get checks buss 'em if they over 20 
 I'll buss yo bitch, only if she over 20 
 I got my bitch just in case you niggas creepin' 
 She'll buss at him, if I hear that nigga creepin' 
 A couple million (I got) 
 A couple hunnid thousands in stock nigga 
 And a couple billions (I got) 
 A seven year old lil boy these folks don't know (I got) 
 Problems like they do 
 Who fucked up? I did 
 When she asked for money, who asked for custody? (I did, I swear to God I did) 
 I swear I told my first lil boy he could have whatever (On me) 
 Million dollar trust fund (on me) 
 If he wants something (on me) 
 But they just so young they don't see 
 They daddy be gone gotta feed they two mouths 
 That ain't easy 
 Try to let 'em know it ain't 'bout me 
 It's about them, gotta let 'em know 
 Whoa whoa whoa 
 If you gotta nigga locked up let me hear you say: 
 Whoa Whoa whoa 
 If you know a nigga dead let me hear you scream: 
 Whoa whoa whoa 
 Lighters up pouring liquor out like: 
 Whoa Whoa Whoa 
 Pulled up on them niggas like: 
 Whoa Whoa 
 Fake boy take my alazay, and my bike you gone be like: 
 Whoa whoa 
 Nigga dissin' I'm a have that shit out on my hand screaming like: 
 Whoa whoa 
 She want my ho 
 Bank account got O's 
 It may seem like life don't love you no more 
 I done had dreams like that felt so real I thought I was woke 
 Sometimes I feel like I wanna give up with no hope 
 Why does it feel like a nigga fucking with me 'cause of what I do? 
 I get the picture 
 I get you niggas 
 I get money, I get bitches 
 I get 100's, I get 50's 
 I get checks over a 20 
 I get checks buss 'em if they over 20 
 I'll buss yo bitch, only if she over 20 
 I got my bitch just incase you niggas creepin' 
 She'll buss at him, if I hear that nigga creepin' 
 Ridin' round with 20 bags in the trunk 
 But that ain't none of my business, I got my own problems 
 My daddy still in the hospital 
 Just lost my grand-mama (grand-mama grand-mama) 
 I come from where you don't come from 
 I from the slums, aka, the fucking jungle 
 I want that tongue if I hear yo ass mumble 
 Look about me, go to.com but 
 Looking for my white Tee 
 Don't give up just because 
 It may seem like life don't love you no more 
 I done had dreams like that felt so real I thought I was woke 
 Sometimes I feel like I wanna give up with no hope 
 Why does it feel like a nigga fucking with me 'cause of what I do? 
 I get the picture 
 I get you niggas 
 I get money, I get bitches 
 I get 100's, I get 50's 
 I get checks over a 20 
 I get checks buss 'em if they over 20 
 I'll buss yo bitch, only if she over 20 
 I got my bitch just incase you niggas creepin' 
 She'll buss at him, if I hear that nigga creepin' 
 In order to get something you ain't never got 
 You gotta do something you ain't never had to do 
 Step out the box nigga 
 But I wouldn't expect you bitch ass niggas to get it 
 Fuck with us, or get fucked over nigga 
 R.H.Q for life 
 Ya bitch!
