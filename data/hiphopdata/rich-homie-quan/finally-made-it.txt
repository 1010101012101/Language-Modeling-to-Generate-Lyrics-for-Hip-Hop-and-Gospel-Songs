We finally made it 
 Told my momma we ain't gotta stretch nomoe 
 Nomoe unemployed checks nomoe 
 I swear imma get her that big hz with that flexin gate 
 Nomoe section eight 
 'Cause we finally made it 
 We made it, we made it 
 I know Teezy would have been proud of me 
 That's why he still living inside of me 
 I say we made it 
 We had to brand ourselves 
 'Cause we ain't basic 
 In my pocket there's a phonebook 
 Alotta pages 
 Got cho address so don't play me 
 I'll have yo momma tryna even out yo cases 
 I'm playing wide both legs 
 Fuck with her she bow leg 
 Feelin' on her booty 
 Like damn that's fake them booty shots 
 He cuffin bitches po legs 
 I been rolling for life for days 
 She wanna suck my dick go head 
 I been to hell and back no set 
 I remember making a palace in the weirdest places 
 Fuck nigga put us out 
 Momma always told me remember faces 
 And I can't spit soft 
 I gotta go the hardest 
 I tell 'em trade up bitch 
 We finally made it 
 Told my momma we ain't gotta stretch nomoe 
 Nomoe unemployed checks nomoe 
 I swear imma get her that big hz with that flexin gate 
 Nomoe section eight 
 'Cause we finally made it 
 We made it, we made it 
 I know Teezy would have been proud of me 
 That's why he still living inside of me 
 I need to see a doctor 'cause I'm sick been spittin' 
 Plus I got alotta partners in the pin and they did 
 'Cause I'm viscous and I'm like a snake 
 I wrap around then and spit venom 
 And I killem 
 And I stay down with my hustle 
 Yuin know my struggle 
 My momma worked a double 
 Juss so I can have double 
 I couldn't take a loss 
 I had to make my money back 
 Told my momma she could dye all her gray hair 
 'Cause they ain't comin' back 
 Now I'm on top 
 And these niggas want to hate 
 They see I came from the block 
 And say he down the same way 
 And I got banked up by the cops 
 But got out the same day 
 And I pat myself on my back 
 Cause nigga... 
 We finally made it
