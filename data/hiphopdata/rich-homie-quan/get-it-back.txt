 I get it back, like I never lost her 
 I surround myself around sum bosses (Rich Homie Baby) 
 Yellow diamond got me feeling cautions 
 And I'm dead fresh without a coffin 
 With all this lean I drink, 
 It feelin' like I'm sleep walkin' 
 Young nigga might stay two nights straight on that greyhound 
 With the same outfit like two days straight, you gotta stay down 
 Fuck what them broke niggas think 
 You laughing cause you paid now 
 I ain't meet her top yet 
 But I were have her face down (Baby) 
 She laughing at me 
 All this money in the plastic baby

 All my cars in the fashion baby 
 All my bars in the plastic baby 
 Which means they new, That's my crew 
 Nigga I'm safe, But ion know 'bout you 
 Young nigga might rob you for that pack 
 You need a life jacket 
 Might take a L on that sack, and get it right back 
 I get back, I get back, I get back, I get back 
 I get back, I get back, I get back, I get back 
 Gotta whole lotta work on me 
 Ain't tryna catch no cell case 
 Had to flush my real down the toilet when 12 came 
 I get back, I get back, I get back, I get back 
 I get back, I get back, I get back, I get back 
 She'll never leave me 
 I squeeze her just like a Capri sun 
 And I swear I get her back just like a refund 
 And she ion walk around with no cash 
 She keep a VISA 
 With the bills all in her purse 
 And I'm back, reimbursed 
 I memory taking them lost's for a week straight 
 I memory throwin' that pack off on the freeway 
 And I swear I got it back just like a reply 
 If I'm on the 1's and 2's 
 I bring it back just like a DJ 
 I left a whole zip a my pa's house 
 All my niggas they dropped out 
 Bullets shooting, you dancing 
 Like we playing hopscotch 
 Got work no clock out 
 That meek on me that fox out 
 Two cars we mobbin out 
 Downtown at the robbin spot (Okay) 
 Young nigga might rob you for that pack 
 You need a life jacket 
 Might take a L on that sack, and get it right back

 I get back, I get back, I get back, I get back 
 Gotta whole lotta work on me 
 Ain't tryna catch no cell case 
 Had to flush my real down the toilet when 12 came
