I've been havin' so much on my mind lately I can't even think straight (I can't even think straight) 
 Grip that muthafuckin' pistol so tight like a muthafuckin' firm handshake (like a handshake) 
 I don't believe in anything on everything 'cause a lot y'all niggas lyin' these days (a lot of y'all niggas lyin') 
 I see my baby boys, I know it may seem hard but I gotta make sure family straight 
 (Rich Homie Baby!) 
 Sometimes it feels like they don't even care about me 
 I was vulnerable and lonely the whole 15 months I was in DeKalb County 
 All blue cutlass call it Carolina 
 I ain't talkin' no (?) you need a pacifier 
 I make her swallow and suck on this pacifier 
 I'll make a story up just to catch a liar 
 'Cause I do not want that around me 
 I'm from East Atlanta residing Fulton County 
 Eat that pussy like a edible yeah brownie 
 So when I eat it I get high 
 Hope you not shy, keep on the lights 
 Growin' up it was different every night 
 No steak, it was just chicken or rice 
 Still send traps for the mice 
 Lot of niggas 'round me yeah they snakes 
 Keep the grass cut don't be late 
 Made the money but never changed 
 I'm tired of holdin' niggas on their fame 
 Made a promise to my momma she can get a new house 
 Basketball money momma she gon' need a new couch 
 A lot of places to hide these money I can't think 
 Where to put at, ay where to put at I just might need to spend it 
 I've been havin' so much on my mind lately I can't even think straight (I can't even think straight) 
 Grip that muthafuckin' pistol so tight like a muthafuckin' firm handshake (like a handshake) 
 I don't believe in anything on everything 'cause a lot y'all niggas lyin' these days (a lot of y'all niggas lyin') 
 I see my baby boys, I know it may seem hard but I gotta make sure family straight 
 Gladis said sit back don't talk pay attention 
 Listen before talk don't talk before listen 
 Muhammad Ali I got barely some (?) 
 Niggas play roles yeah they actin' and scripted 
 I might pour up some more Act in my kidney 
 Might hit my ex 'cause my main hoe is trippin' 
 Shoot at yo' hat 'cause my cane is (?) 
 Shot at yo' leg hit yo' ankle you limpin' 
 Pullin' back up with my nigga, my nigga 
 Pistol tucked down by my dick in my zipper 
 Alcohol bullets they eatin' yo' liver 
 For my dick make her pull up make her deliver 
 I done worked too hard to go back to where I came from 
 They say I changed but I feel like I'm still the same Quan 
 Control these niggas' powers and they cut the game on 
 Block all these haters and put a tour on for the same ones 
 I've been havin' so much on my mind lately I can't even think straight (I can't even think straight) 
 Grip that muthafuckin' pistol so tight like a muthafuckin' firm handshake (like a handshake) 
 I don't believe in anything on everything 'cause a lot y'all niggas lyin' these days (a lot of y'all niggas lyin') 
 I see my baby boys, I know it may seem hard but I gotta make sure family straight 
 You gotta make sure family straight 
 If ain't nobody straight, after that make sure yo' dog straight 
 You know what I'm sayin'? 
 Keep them mice far away from you 
 Cause rats are not good 
 You know cats eat those, and I'ma big dog 
 Rich Homie!
