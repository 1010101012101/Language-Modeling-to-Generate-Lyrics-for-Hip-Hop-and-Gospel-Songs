Yeah, party at the mansion 
 I got me like- 
 15 hoes, all of 'em ready 
 Pull back up, Suburban Chevy 
 Niggas talk, bitches talk 
 Money walk, let that money walk 
 They hated on me, now they on my nuts 
 Take care of my fam, 'cause now I'm up 
 Money tall, money comes, money goes 
 When that money get so big it's hard to keep that money fold 
 When I was young and we was broke I saw a lot of things 
 Couldn't stay out of jail I caught a lot of cases 
 Under 25 with a black card in my wallet baby 
 Who the hell said that money make you a boss lil' baby 
 You see that caution tape, so you can't come 'round here if you do not know nobody 
 Money to the ceiling been saving since I had nothin' 
 I don't have no feelings, I been hurt so I can't trust ya 
 Geeked up, blowing on purple feelin' like Urkel 
 All these beats I murder, no squares in my circle 
 Little kids they look up to me gotta be a better person 
 Got pulled over know I'm dirty pray them folks don't search me 
 Cause at the house I got like- 
 15 hoes, all of 'em ready 
 Pull back up, Suburban Chevy 
 Niggas talk, bitches talk 
 Money walk, let that money walk 
 They hated on me, now they on my nuts 
 Take care of my fam, 'cause now I'm up 
 Money tall, money comes, money goes 
 When that money get so big it's hard to keep that money fold 
 I remember they say I wouldn't have shit 
 Now I got like 3 or 4 establishments 
 When I was lil' I ain't have the best all the kids was laughing at me 
 By the time I was in high school told them pussy niggas class in session 
 I passed the lesson 
 No asking questions got that bass in my trunk 
 Surrounded with my day ones 
 If you try this Rich Homie shit 
 Boy, I swear these niggas they goin' 
 Shoot up everything in sight, might hit your daughter and son 
 I got robbers from River, and none of my shooters gon' run 
 Put it in my little boy Devin name, so he can have a trust fund 
 When he get older, when he grow up he can be a better man than me 
 The plan for me is to sit back with me feet up, laid back 
 It's hard to choose 'cause I got like- 
 15 hoes, all of 'em ready 
 Pull back up, Suburban Chevy 
 Niggas talk, bitches talk 
 Money walk, let that money walk 
 They hated on me, now they on my nuts 
 Take care of my fam, 'cause now I'm up 
 Money tall, money comes, money goes 
 When that money get so big it's hard to keep that money fold
