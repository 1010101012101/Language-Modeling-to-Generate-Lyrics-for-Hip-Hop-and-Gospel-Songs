Yeah, you got Celly Cel back in this muthafucka 
 Once again, you know 
 'Bout to drop this soul playa shit on y'all 
 You know, nothin' but that realness 
 Can ya feel this though 
 Yeah... Gonna ride wit ya nigga 'cause it's goin' down 
 They say break yo'self or make yo'self 
 So I said fuck it, bought a glock so I could take myself 
 Through all this soft shit a nigga face as a youngsta 
 Loc'ed ass niggas made that hillside a monster 
 OG's hoopin' at the school house and shootin' dice 
 In and out the pen, real niggas might ? nice 
 Made this hog get the brew 
 Made me hit the weed 
 Eatin' at the ho house 
 Moms know a nigga kill 
 Go to my room, sleep off my high, and hit the door 
 Tellin' myself "I ain't smokin' weed no more" 
 But you know 
 Them lies as the days go by 
 Me, Choo-Choo and Clyde smokin' dank till the sun rise 
 Walk into the school house 
 Franklin Junior 
 Back when it was cool to kiss and tell and spread rumors 
 Boxin' toe to toe and everybody in a circle 
 Sockin' mutha-fuckas till they eyes turn purple 
 Ain't no set trippin', no jumpin', it's just 1 on 1 
 Fools throwin' thangs to the end 
 Back then, it was fun 
 No gunshots 
 No need to hit the floor 
 But after shool 
 The whole city woken up 
 Let's hit the park fool 
 To see a little league, a Babe Ruth baseball game 
 Niggas was down there cuttin' up or throwin' thangs 
 Chasin' 5 off for hot dogs and fries bitch 
 But back then, you still couldn't tell a nigga shit 
 1 - (Can't tell me shit) 
 Bitch made niggas can't tell a nigga shit 
 (They can't tell me shit) 
 Skanlezz Azz Bytchez can't tell a nigga shit 
 (Can't tell me shit) 
 Punk police can't tell a nigga shit 
 (They can't tell a nigga shit) 
 Fuck you bitch - you can't tell a nigga shit 
 Got a little older, now the park is a joke 
 'Cause all the ball players out there slangin' dope 
 Some of my niggas is on grimmies, but I didn't slip 
 Ain't that a bitch, you can't tell a nigga shit 
 So I mind my own, find my home 
 Now I'm in the zone 
 Behind Farmers in the alley, gettin' my money on 
 Had 10 dollas and JB gave me the other 10 
 Bought a breakdown, now I'm Gone With The Wind 
 Brakes with the ???, ounces and QP's 
 The half ki's, now I'm sellin' weight to the G's 
 Hit Oxford Street, spent a grip, now I'm ready to go 
 To Hogan Hoctors, it be bitches at the talent show 
 And for all and hoop games had hoes 
 Hilail and Hogie, you know it was on fo' sho' 
 Reece assists and Redge with the Tamahawk ? up 
 Then the whole town, mobbin' down to the waterfront 
 Niggas in Granadas, Cougars and Mustangs 
 Stars and Volvos 
 Nobody fuckin' with them ? thangs 
 Me, G-Roc, JB and Lil' C-Mo 
 Puffin' on indo 
 Splittin' 4 double O Z's 
 Young G's tryin' to live 
 And when they shut the ship door, we goin' under the bridge 
 Gettin' whip-lash from the brake gas mash and dip 
 'Cause back then, you couldn't tell a nigga shit 
 Made it to a G, but ain't no love in my city 
 Now we set trippin', all these fools actin' shitty 
 Niggas wanna reel me in, but didn't know 
 When you fuckin' wit the big fish, you fuckin' wit a funeral 
 No more toe to toe 
 HK-44's 
 Now what they know about the mutha fuckin' murda shows 
 Strap on my right hand side, in the Bay area 
 Shit is gettin' scarier 
 Niggas are ??? 
 Fuck the bird, I'm the nigga bailin' ? early 
 Trigga happy nigga wit a head fulla Shirlies, on 
 Christian brothas in ??? 
 Or drinkin' hurricanes wit my niggas in da click 
 So deep, I can't call it 
 Spend about a million dollas at the liquor store 
 I'm just an alcoholic 
 40, Water and Legit put me on the map 
 Got my foot in the door, now I'm givin' up dank 
 Sick wit his last job, my 9 to 5 
 The shit I used to dream about is how I survive 
 Lifestyle of a mack 
 Funk for life 
 Some Heat 4 Yo' Azz 
 Them Killa Kali niggas blast and smash 
 Without a murda weapon or a witness 
 Too many niggas in yo' car, risky business 
 They turn snitches 
 Break down and have the po-po's at yo' front door 
 And all real niggas know 
 Who rides sucka-free, on the solo 
 When you empty the clip, they can't tell a nigga shit
