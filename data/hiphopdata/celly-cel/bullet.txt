Sitting on the shelf, they got me stuck up in this box 
 Chopping it up with the homies, having visions of a glock 
 17 niggas on my team, can't wait to fill clip up 
 We jumping out the barrel with my niggas, shooting shit up 
 See under Niner Ross, black Talon, hollow tips flow 
 Aim me at the chest, I'm making sure that vest don't get no love 
 Ain't even breathing, leave the body shitting like a seagull 
 See, I'm illegal, I got pockets like that [unverified] eagle 
 Fucking around with me is danger 
 I'm talking shit trying to brainwash the trigger 
 When I'm in the chamber 
 Don't give a fuck if it's a accident or on purpose 
 When I'm coming out the chamber fool, it's just in service 
 Don't get nervous when you see what I do 
 I love to hit the target and when I'm breaking that skin, ooh 
 Travel through his heart, ricochet off the nearest bone 
 Rip his insides up, shatter his spine, now I'm gone 
 Laying by the body, waiting for the Feds 
 Swoop me up for evidence, then I'm just some melted lead 
 It ain't no thang, got me back where I started 
 In a box with my homies, waiting for my next target 
 The mothafucking bullet 
 Shooting up shit everywhere, every city in every state 
 Don't give a fuck about who, when the bullet fly 
 The only thought that's on my mind is die nigga, die 
 But what do ya know 
 Looks like I'm 'bout to be purchased again 
 I seen a nigga ask for them black Talons and grin 
 It won't be long till they let me loose 
 Got me in the clip, drinking gin with no fucking juice 
 It's going down, I know they riding on some fools tonight 
 Hit the lights, squeeze the trigger, send me on my flight 
 Don't give a fuck about who I hit, when I fly 
 The only thought that's on my mind is die nigga, die 
 Women and children and babies, I know it's crazy 
 See, I'm a bullet, it's my job, man, that shit don't faze me 
 Even the hand that's on the trigger get shot too 
 Wherever the barrel aiming at, that's who I end up smoking, fool 
 Don't get it twisted, I got no love for none of y'all 
 Got to dig a tunnel through your head and watch the body fall 
 Just shoot and I'ma do the rest 
 I love giving young niggas cardiac arrests 
 Bullet-proof niggas, I go up in 'em quickly 
 The ambulance picked him up with shit all in his Dickies 
 Just cock the glock, put your finger on the trigger, pull it 
 And make a mothafucka feel the bullet 
 Yeah, another victim of these mothafucking bullets 
 Once we pull the trigger, don't get nervous 
 'Cause it's instant mothafucking service 
 Yeah, breakin fools off every mothafucking day 
 Up out the chamber, it's that sneaky mothafucka creeping 
 You heard a shot but didn't know until the blood was leaking 
 Up out your chest, you seen your flesh was a bloody mess 
 Dropped down on your knees and ran outta breath 
 Sentenced to your death 
 Got hit by the wig splitting, shirt ripping, pistol wippin' nigga 
 Catching 'em slipping when they set tripping 
 Dipping and dabbing, you niggas know who I am 
 And can't be fucking with them faulty heaters that be jamming 
 I love to fly and when they jam, I can't come out and kick it 
 Just pick a target, point me at it and see how quick I hit it 
 Dropping bodies by the dozens, in and out your cousins 
 I'm burning niggas like a oven, giving up no loving 
 [Unverified] with my dogs, riding in a 50 round clip 
 Ready to make the hit, talking long shit, bitch 
 Hit the floor before I hit the door and split ya with some heat 
 Take your head and leave your body in the street 
 As I creep, up on my next mothafucking victim 
 Sweep him off his feet, pull the trigger, let me sick him 
 Hit him high, hit him low, you know how it go 
 Put your finger on the trigger, pull it, the mothafucking bullet 
 The mothafucking bullet 
 Mobbing through your hood and taking head 
 Showing no mothafucking remorse 
 We don't give a fuck about you 
 The bullet, spraying up shit everywhere we go 
 Don't give a fuck, laying men 6 feet on the regular
