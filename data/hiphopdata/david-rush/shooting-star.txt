 Part-party rock. Shake That, shake that, move that, shake that 
 We like to party rock, we came to lose the troll, shake that. 
 We came to the party people and the dance floor. 
 'Cause we're, LMFAO. 
 Well I'm Redfoo, and I'm SkyBlu, and we brought some friends along. 
 Yo David, Rudolf and Pitbull and they'll help toy sing this song.

 You are a shooting star, that's why you are my favorite 
 I love just who you are, I ain't gon' try to change ya 
 You are a shooting star, That's why you are my favorite

 I caught her when she fell from Heaven 
 1 to 10 baby girl was an eleven 
 And I ain't tryin' to spit no game 
 But I'm just tryin' to figure out from where you came 
 Because a style like her 
 Man, it rarely occurs 
 In a world like this 
 The only way you're gonna meet a girl like this 
 Get up in spaceship and take that trip 
 You gotta have a way with words 
 You need a sorta combo to get at her 
 Every other chick becomes a blur 
 Be my Mrs., I'll be your sir 
 I love the way she is 
 The way she are 
 A shooting star 
 And I pray that you'll never change 
 Never eva change 
 Just stay the same cause...

 Look up in sky, it's a bird, it's a plane 
 Nah baby girl, that's a shooting star with your name 
 I ain't gon' lie (lie) 
 I told a lot of lies and played a lot of games (games) 
 But with you it's not the same, for you I'ma ride 
 I want you by my side 
 I feel a lot better while you play with my mind 
 I'ma tell you one more time 
 For you I'm hussle, for you I'm a grind (grind) 
 You were there through the pain 
 You stood right by me 
 Thanks to you I survived (survived) 
 I guess it's true what they say 
 "Love is bad," hahaha 
 We be together till we die 
 Until death do us part 
 Baby you my heart 
 They can take all the houses and the car 
 But they'll never take my shooting star

 I-I-I-I love just who you are, I ain't gon' try to change ya 
 You are a shooting star, that's why you are my favorite 
 I love just who you are, I ain't gon' try to change ya 
 You are a shooting star, That's why you are my favorite

 Now as I lay her down to sleep 
 Pray my Lord this girl I keep 
 Usually by now I would've went a creep 
 With a P.Y.T that I met last week 
 But it's something about this one 
 That make me not have to go get none 
 Ask her what I need and it goes get done 
 And the same thing back so it makes us one 
 So every morning when I roll over 
 Pray that she's there on my arm and shoulder 
 And I can be her blanket when the world gets colder 
 Watch me make her, watch me mold her 
 She got me open like my knows ajar 
 Heart beats fast like I stole a car 
 I never through it would go this far 
 Tonight I wish on a shooting star 
 (Star, star, star, star, star)

 You are a shooting star, That's why you are my favorite
