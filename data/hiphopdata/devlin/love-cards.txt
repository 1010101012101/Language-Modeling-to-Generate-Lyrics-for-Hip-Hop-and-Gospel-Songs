Loves not on the cards 
 No time to mend a broken heart 
 No knocking down this wall 
 I told you when it started 
 I don't do broken hearted 
 Don't talk about love silly, you don't love Jimmy 
 This ain't a game, girl, and I ain't the king of hearts 
 I'm trying to say loves not on the cards, can't hold hands I ain't into romance 
 But... if you wanted, I can take you to my yard 
 Treat you like a bad girl tell me what you are 
 I'll have you spinning like a fan belt, you won't know where you are 
 Call me Sirius you're riding with a star 
 Scrap that I ain't a star, I am just spaced out 
 And To be honest, we can use a little space now 
 Always said that I wouldn't be there tomorrow 
 Bet your bottom dollar I'll be gone before your days out 
 Anyway, you couldn't love me if you tried 
 Because I'm lovely on the surface, but uglier inside 
 'Cause if I had ten mill and my name is Raymond Weil 
 I still wouldn't have the money or the time 
 Love's not on the cards 
 No time to mend the broke heart 
 No knocking down this wall 
 I told you when it started 
 I don't do broken hearted 
 I don't think you're listening to Etta Bond 
 Don't get emotional, call me Voldemort 
 A bad wizard, I just wanna give a witch a wand 
 All this early hour small talk's getting long 
 You wanna fight, take a pipe bomb to Lebanon 
 You want love, come closer and take the leggings off 
 But tell me that you love me and then I'm jetting off 
 Time to cut the ride short, driver let me off 
 'Cause if you never saw me on the stage 
 You'd ignore me in the rave, level with me with straight 
 I'm a 10 your an 8 and now it's getting rather late 
 Don't be offended, 'cause I'm blunt like James 
 I ain't trying to make your heart break 
 Just accelerate your heart rate while you say my name 
 And I'm sorry, but I seem to have forgotten yours 
 Remind me, is it Janet or Jane? 
 Love notes on the cards 
 No time to mend the broke hearts 
 I won't get down this road 
 I told you and it started 
 I drove to broken hearted 
 You can't look down the heart in my chest 
 I'm too young to have a cardiac arrest 
 Till my dreams come true, I can't rest 
 Keep it calm, scar my flesh 
 Love's throwing the cards, I guess 
 Love notes on the cards 
 No time to mend the broke hearts 
 I won't get down this road 
 I told you and it started 
 I drove to broken hearted
