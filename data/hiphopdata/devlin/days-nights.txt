I've been up for nights and days 
 And my eyes remain wide awake 
 Because more than my life's at steak 
 So I ain't got time for blinkin' 
 All the time I'm thinkin' 
 If this ain't hell it's one fiery place 
 Metallic projectiles fly in ya face 
 And leave you like human garbage lyin' in drains 
 I've gotta keep my eyeballs open 
 The only thing that'll minus the pain like ibuprofen is 
 9milli and K on the case 
 I don't feel in control like pilots in planes 
 I'm trapped in this winding maze 
 I'm an insomniac, I'm insane 
 I've been up for days and nights 
 Through this crazy life 
 But I'll sleep when I'm dead 
 Until they pay me right 
 My eyes are open wide 
 But I'll sleep when I'm dead 
 When everything on my to do list is ticked off 
 Then maybe I can drift off 
 Until then I'm wide awake, lyin' in a daze 
 My eyeballs gaze 
 Hypnotized by the sound of my wrist watch 
 Clickin' tick tock 
 I'm in charge of the underground just like Brick Top 
 So I can't sleep I'd be wrong if I did stop 
 If I'm focused on writing a verse 
 You couldn't put me to sleep 
 With a thousand and nine 
 Bottles of night nurse 
 It's likely I'll put ya lights out first 
 So I'll sleep when I'm restin' in peace 
 Until then I've gotta bless these beats 
 Till I conquer the streets 
 If I'm conscious, I can't get lost in a dream 
 I've been up for days and nights 
 Through this crazy life 
 But I'll sleep when I'm dead 
 Until they pay me right 
 My eyes are open wide 
 But I'll sleep when I'm dead 
 If you're drowsy, remain in a slumber 
 My metaphors flow over ya head 
 Like a button less jumper 
 I can't sleep till I'm in the sky 
 Like lightning and thunder 
 Sometimes at night I wonder 
 Is pursuein' this dream a blunder 
 Or the best thing that I ever did 
 I can't sleep or slip till I'm 6 feet under 
 Hence the song I'll sleep when I'm dead 
 You might only need money to survive 
 But my life relies on a needle instead 
 I wanna eat steak meals everyday 
 I'm sick and tired of livin' on a diet 
 Of beans and bread 
 So believe what I said 
 I'll sleep when I'm where 
 I'll sleep when I'm what 
 I'll sleep when I'm dead 
 I've been up for days and nights 
 Through this crazy life 
 But I'll sleep when I'm dead 
 Until they pay me right 
 My eyes are open wide 
 But I'll sleep when I'm dead 
 I've been up for days and nights 
 Through this crazy life 
 But I'll sleep when I'm dead 
 Until they pay me right 
 My eyes are open wide 
 But I'll sleep when I'm dead
