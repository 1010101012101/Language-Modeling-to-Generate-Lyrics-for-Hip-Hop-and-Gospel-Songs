Horus:] 
 I am nothing, nothing, nothing but a dreamer wishing on a star 
 I have nothing, nothing but pure imagination, hoping it can take me far. 
 Devlin: 
 If you long to be free, come for the ride you'll like what you see, 
 I reside in an infinite dream, and I fly in the sky like D double E 
 Exploring the depths of the sea, fish red yellow pink purple and green 
 Swin with sharks of the deadliest breed, mother nature is heaven indeed 
 Follow me on a marvelous trip, and insight into the bars that I script 
 Imagination is vital like timing, or the breaks in the car that you sit 
 I got a golden ticket like Charlie, to advance the position I'm in 
 And now I'm on the front line like an army, what the chances of trickle and thin. 
 I am nothing, nothing, nothing but a dreamer wishing on a star 
 I have nothing, nothing but pure imagination, hoping it can take me far 
 I keep repeating in the dark, she said it didn't matter who you are 
 I am nothing, nothing, nothing but a dreamer 'Nothing but a dream' 
 Devlin: 
 I float on the breeze, like the pollen and the birds and the bee's 
 I'll always have roots in the ends, Like bushes and tree's upon metropolitan streets 
 But I'll smile when I'm dreaming, I'm somewhere far on the wings of a phoenix 
 Ow what a marvelous evening, I met Bob Marley and sparked up a 3 skin 
 And spoke about common affairs, and various ways to build and repair 
 Look deep in the depths of your mind, and you'll find that your imagination is there 
 I can't stop till my family crest is cemented in time, and I'm half way there 
 And then when I float on the breeze, I'll leave the throne to my heir. 
 I am nothing, nothing, nothing but a dreamer wishing on a star 
 I have nothing, nothing but pure imagination, hoping it can take me far 
 I keep repeating in the dark, she said it didn't matter who you are 
 I am nothing, nothing, nothing but a dreamer 'Nothing but a dream' 
 Devlin: 
 Through the stress and pain I've seen, is it wrong to dream a dream 
 Everyone holds the right, to have some hope in life 
 Through the stress and pain I've seen, is it wrong to dream a dream 
 When you find one hold it tight, it just might be your guiding light. 
 I am nothing, nothing, nothing but a dreamer wishing on a star 
 I have nothing, nothing but pure imagination, hoping it can take me far 
 I keep repeating in the dark, she said it didn't matter who you are 
 I am nothing, nothing, nothing but a dreamer 'Nothing but a dream'
