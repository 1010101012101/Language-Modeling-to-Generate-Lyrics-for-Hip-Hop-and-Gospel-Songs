Listen, 
 They wanna build me up, 
 Postpone my attempt to kill my bars, 
 Well you better have an army, 
 Cause' it's day one all of my boys show love, 
 Now I'm here where I should be, 
 When I'm high of a night I wonder where I would be, 
 On the streets where the thieves and the hoods be, 
 (The world still turns around) 
 As life continues 
 And with the lyrics and rhymes I bring you 
 I'm telling you strife you been through 
 Might make your heart feel colder than pingu, 
 I stand in a place, 
 Contemplating distant memories 
 You have never seen so many tear drops in a place 
 But a voice in my brain keeps telling me 
 (They build me up, to break me down, 
 But the world still turns around 
 They build me up, to break me down, 
 But the world still turns around) 
 Yeah, as the road spins on it's axis 
 I feel trapped in a box like matchsticks 
 But I've got the UK head over heels 
 Like gymnastics on a mad practice in back flips 
 But they wanna steel my career like silicon mastic 
 Some days when I wake I tell myself I'm feeling fantastic 
 Cause' whatever occurs 
 Time won't stop the earth still turns 
 Every lesson I've learnt 
 I reckon it's worth the pain and seconds of hurt 
 So as the world rotates 
 Isolate and float through space 
 A never ending cycles occurin' 
 A carousel that won't stop turning 
 They build me up, to break me down, 
 But the world still turns around 
 They build me up, to break me down, 
 But the world still turns around. 
 They wanna build me up to break me down 
 They show love when I was heard up 
 And now I'm coming up it seems they wanna break me down 
 They wanna build me up to break me down 
 They show love when I was heard up 
 But now I'm coming up it seems they wanna break me down. 
 They build me up, to break me down, 
 But the world still turns around, 
 They build me up, to break me down, 
 But the world still turns around.
