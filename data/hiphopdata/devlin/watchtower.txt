There must be some kind of way out of here 
 Said the joker to the thief, yeah 
 There's too much confusion 
 Mmm I can't get no relief 
 Yeah 
 I see jokers on my left, thieves upon my right 
 You'd find me in the middle if I picked a different life 
 Before my name started tripling in size 
 But I'm still showing signs all attributed tonight 
 In the pitch black, it's too cold 
 I'm all alone take me back to the roads 
 I had to rode to get here and I'll hitch back 
 Get a cab to my mother's house 
 See my old man and grab a six pack 
 Tell my brother I love him 
 And give him something that will see him through the hard times 
 What's a brother for? 
 When I'm sick of this life I see 
 It has to be my family who lift me off the floor 
 Make sense of all the madness in a world full of money, full of tears, full of war 
 I was a failed man and worse I couldn't give a fuck 
 Save your wine for the entrepreneurs 
 All along the watchtower 
 Princes kept the view 
 While all the women came and went 
 Barefoot servants too, yeah 
 Outside in the cold distance 
 A wildcat did growl 
 Two riders were approaching 
 And the wind began to howl 
 'Cause your world is the same as mine 
 Pour more blood in your cup 
 Take a sip full of sin and let your taste buds savour the buzz 
 The flavour of an ill-mannered nature 
 That lingers on as animals in all of us 
 Trying to fight for the right to live a life 
 But some will never win though 
 That's why they live a lie 
 I don't think I'll ever win 
 All of this is anything 
 When I die I hope a love is at my side 
 There's no trap door, or get out clause 
 The world can be your oyster or a set of jail doors 
 You've seen mine, I think it's time I see yours 
 I bet you that we've been scarred by the same swords 
 Some are lost some are... 
 Apart from the fact I live my life in the light and now I'm trapped in it 
 The way I feel within a few years time 
 I might have a couple kids and just forget I ever wrote lyrics 
 All along the watchtower 
 Princes kept the view 
 While all the women came and went 
 Barefoot servants too, yeah 
 Outside in the cold distance 
 A wildcat did growl 
 Two riders were approaching 
 And the wind began to howl 
 Take away the treasure of a man 
 Convinced that he holds heaven in his hands 
 Even though I ain't religious I'm a little superstitious 
 Maybe there is a promised land 
 But will I make it or not is a different matter 
 I've been a joker, I've been a thief, I've been a rapper 
 I've been the only enemy that I can never beat 
 Give me a piece of mind upon a platinum platter 
 All along the watchtower 
 Princes kept the view 
 While all the women came and went 
 Barefoot servants too, yeah 
 Outside in the cold distance 
 A wildcat did growl 
 Two riders were approaching 
 And the wind began to howl
