According to the aztec calendar 2012 is the end of the world 
 And time will unwind with a celestual cross in in the skys in sync 
 And in line with itself so forget life as you know it 
 If you wanna view life in the eyes of a poet 
 Peer through mine in this fearful time 
 Where wages are cut but tax keeps growing 
 When the globe collapses on it's axis 
 Watch men, women and children with axes 
 Fighting for food cause? 
 And they haven't got jack shit 
 It looks like disasters back with a sting like elastic 
 But on a whole new scale now I'm talking inter galactic 
 Genocide in a moment of madness 
 As some set on the end of days 
 Capital city's burning in flames 
 Ocean swepped your possessions away 
 Welcome to the end of days 
 As some set on end of days 
 There ain't no escaping natures rage 
 And I've never seen an atheist pray 
 Until the approaching of judgment day 
 Buildings burning 
 Pilgrims verming 
 Children are serving 
 Searching for earnings 
 Old bill are lerking 
 Circle the circuit 
 Cctv cameras are perving 
 Don't park there if you ain't got a permit 
 Murders occurring but low level crime is the type their concerned with 
 Yeah with a microchip bill gates is a serpent in person 
 You relied on emergency service 999 says a lot when you turn it 
 The devil in disguise all loves been deserted 
 I'm watching animosity spread like herpes 
 I visualise allien crafts decending on earthlings 
 And all homosapiens left in the dirt like worms when there squirming 
 I smell petrol burning 
 As some set on the end of days 
 Capital city's burning in flames 
 Ocean swepped your possessions away 
 Welcome to the end of days 
 As some set on end of days 
 There ain't no escaping natures rage 
 And I've never seen an atheist pray 
 Until the approaching of judgment day 
 Insight into a world of decline 
 Like michelle nostradammas mind 
 A moment of peace is harder to find 
 The thicker the skin the darker the mind 
 [?] Accompany stars that are sent from the sky 
 A lot of men are repending tonight 
 You wasted your life now wave it goodbye 
 New world orders an anogram of now 
 So we ain't got time to be standing around 
 Devil's on your doorstep 
 He's got you in a tight grip like a forestep thundering down
