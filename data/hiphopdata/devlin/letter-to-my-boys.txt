As my head spins, I don't know 
 How this slight show had the time to grow 
 I was too interested on live the life alone 
 Chase the money, chase the savings 
 Man, doesn't really matter 
 I'm just trying to make this happen, here's a letter to my boys 
 Out to everyone I ever ran the streets with 
 You know more soul, but this here is deep shit 
 Me, wilsey and dope inside of a chip wheep 
 Or in the park in a Friday night with free chips 
 Or are plenty, with four are out the belly 
 Few less guards with a bit that last the many 
 Bags it out, trying to rule worry bands weary 
 Face is in the place, back in that where it was heavy 
 Don't get me hard, fools say start slow 
 Freestyling in this stats flat we're good at 
 Then it disappeared and never fooled to turn back 
 Out the jacko, see my wrist slash but gold smash 
 When little Guinness was as quiet as a field mass 
 We would've stole your car and probably though it was the start 
 But it's bigger than my little brother 
 He wait for princess, it's too many names to cover 
 As my head spins, I don't know 
 How this slight show had the time to grow 
 I was too interested on live the life alone 
 Chase the money, chase the savings 
 Man, doesn't really matter 
 I'm just trying to make this happen, here's a letter to my boys 
 As it grew, I feel a gold fraction under quicker 
 I felt lonely inside and maybe slightly bitter 
 Start writing, told myself I'll be a spitter 
 Then I met dogs and Mikey and the Picture figure 
 Too big to lock the quick fig from an older level 
 Mine's sort of fool pine dose to see the rebel 
 At fifteen I resurrected my whole crew from hard times 
 Youngen on this mad fire 
 Then we met Deves and 'cause he only put it in 
 Along with Benson and Emma I knew from my science 
 Back in '05 when we used to smoke and drink 
 Fifty kids on boot street where rule the piffs 
 Way back when it was me upon my bones 
 A shoe lace around my neck, held my keys up close 
 He waits a Lego flash, check his back on violence out 
 We represent it to the fullest after time, fact 
 As my head spins, I don't know 
 How this slight show had the time to grow 
 I was too interested on live the life alone 
 Chase the money, chase the savings 
 Man, doesn't really matter 
 I'm just trying to make this happen, here's a letter to my boys 
 Be Bred, two friends, come I come west 
 My boys now, we share a pile and lie the rest 
 Where's new gets and my gets and at the park 
 In the youth club with haseties and we spray some bars 
 Three years by, rest in peace, Lace 
 Remember days he used to run around the heath wave 
 But I don't get to see your face into these days 
 Last crase, will I make it through this grind rage 
 Get started, show 'em love, they really understood 
 Though I was better, then fucking good, they grind the hood 
 Behind the mic, slop it still do 
 Then it see is too expensive, I move to lose 
 And by the way, I forgot to say 
 I met when I was 13, I lose by the place 
 For mom the dictorial role when we used to spray 
 Bars on the old block, we're jumping right in flame 
 So 
 As my head spins, I don't know 
 How this slight show had the time to grow 
 I was too interested on live the life alone 
 Chase the money, chase the savings 
 Man, doesn't really matter 
 I'm just trying to make this happen, here's a letter to my boys
