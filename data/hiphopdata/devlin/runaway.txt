Listen Yeah, 
 Life of time of dreaming 
 Visualizing paradise 
 I woke up, rolled over and told my girl were leaving, 
 Its time to sacrifice the lot, 
 Because you ain't happy with your job, and round here nothing seems appealing, 
 So let me know you feel the same, 
 Throw your life into a case, and we'll depart from Victoria this evening, 
 And embark on a path of rediscovery 
 Searching for the fruits of the lost garden of Eden, 
 I'm wondering if I ran away and came back another day, 
 And will the young men roll with the metal put the guns away, 
 And when the devil who took charge will the slums be safe, 
 I pray that life's right for everybody's mummsies sake, 
 And if I could disappear for years and re-appear, 
 Will my natural intuition still be crystal clear, 
 Or will I have lost clarity, 
 Through this trivial pursuit we're walking through so casually. 
 I gotta leave I gotta go, 
 There's nothing here for me no more, 
 I gotta be free 
 I gotta be somewhere that I can just be me 
 And I'll run, run, runaway 
 Run, run, runaway, 
 Run, run, runaway, 
 I'll runaway 
 We'll share a last cigarette and walk into the station, 
 Purchase two tickets to an alien destination, 
 Board the train and witness pain upon the faces of multicultural races 
 But not me and my girl, we're breaking through like an escapist 
 Because we need to escape this 
 And I for one have got my mind made up 
 Even if where we stay is make shift 
 I can't remain in this domain of semi-ape shit 
 All I see is hatred, if I disappeared I wonder how many men would miss me 
 Or would they forget like I erased my name from history 
 I'm still trying yet to make a break within the chain of pain and misery 
 And vanish of the planet like a mystery 
 And if I did return would the things be the same but worse, 
 You see the gear stick shift and then whip reverse 
 And I'd be straight back on my travels 
 Burning rubber over gravel till we see the English channel 
 I gotta leave I gotta go, 
 There's nothing here for me no more, 
 I gotta be free 
 I gotta be somewhere that I can just be me 
 And I'll run, run, runaway 
 Run, run, runaway, 
 Run, run, runaway, 
 I'll runaway 
 As the carriage pulls away 
 I'll pull my lady closer and I'll tell her she's okay, 
 'Cause if we never broke the barricades today we'd always be afraid, 
 And left to feel threatened in this dark and deadly maze, 
 But now I've come of age and as the train starts entering suburbia a smile comes across my face 
 The unwinding of eternal rage 
 That was locked up inside just like my mates behind prison gates, 
 If I could runaway, and come back another day, 
 I'll let this song play on the summers longest day, 
 Kick back and just enjoy the rays, 
 All the lager and the **** to blaze 
 If I ever contemplate returning to this crazy place 
 I'll leave it long enough so they don't recognize my face 
 Ill let this song play on the summers longest day 
 While we roll upon the roads of the motorway 
 I gotta leave I gotta go, 
 There's nothing here for me no more, 
 I gotta be free 
 I gotta be somewhere that I can just be me 
 And I'll run, run, runaway 
 Run, run, runaway, 
 Run, run, runaway, 
 I'll runaway 
 I'll runaway
