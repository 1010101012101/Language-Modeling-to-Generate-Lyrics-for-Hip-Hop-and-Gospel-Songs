How different is my life to another man's, 
 I'm just trying to earn a living in this cold, cold place. 
 Then escape to the summer sands, until my time has expired I'll be trying and 
 I finally found sometihng I'll never give up, finally found something I can be proud of (I finally found something I can be proud of) 
 Hustling, money coming in, there ain't nothing worse than watching mummy struggling. suffering, and I can't tell you how easy it is but I can tell you how tough it's been. I know you're wondering, well first off, I would need a warehouse to store my troubles in. nobodies aware of what I'm covering up but one thing [?] my bloods bubbling. I'm stressed out, frustrated and hungry that's enough to send a man over the edge. and if it ain't me against the world then I feel like I'm going against this whole country. nobodies on my side they wanna take my soul, body and my mind but I still got a problem with property so watch [?]

 First off, for too many years I've been worse off now every single verse is bloody worth dosh, it's hard to always stay on track sometimes I swerve off, lifes a lesson, in one second you could learn a lot. give me the chance to accelerate and I'm burning off. because I've been left too long to rot in the eternal fog and I was always told to aim for the stars now I'm cruising through space like scotty and the captains log. deep space mind, don't hate me just make yours how I make mine? take time to stay tight, and when times get messy like a cage fight, we will soon see which individual suffers stage fright. I'll be ready on the double, my flows flexible and suple leave you buried like a dead man in the ruble. fully proud how my teams emerging from the tunel full of never ending trouble!

 I was on the road all day or I was getting locked up. had find some other way to change my life up, [?] I was on the path but sometimes I fucked it right up. I was either thinking I should leave or I should quit, but something always telling me I don't know what it is, I got something I am proud of, I'm enjoying this, I know, I know, I know. I would always try my best but nothing ever worked, so someone please just tell me straight cause now I'm feeing worse. now my pockets [?] on fire all my credits burnt. I always paid the price and I never learned. I was just a crazy kid, broke and I was lost, cause anytime I would flip and they would call the dogs, always scrapping, always fighting, show my teeth [?] music changed my life now I'm never lost.
