I'm fed up with life at the minute so I get it off my chest when I'm writing my lyrics having to give my Nan hospital visits. I pray to god she don't turn to a spirit 'cause she's the only Nan I got left and it hurts in my head when I contemplate her death knowing that 1 day soon shell be gone that thought leaves me short of breath. 
 And yeah that's just 1 of the things, that got me feeling that I'm running in rings no process made that's a regular thing but if I stop spitting that il be the death of a king it's like I've gotta learn to focus my mind and I know it's the times that no one behold the scene could be mine draw you a picture with words of described with a caption besides. 
 As life goes by in the blink of an eye I stay focus on writing my rhymes these streets are inviting to crime if I didn't write rhymes and I'd probably go mad in my mind 'cause its only music that keeps me sane plus bud and beers to forget the pain just reflecting on days run away 
 (Smasher) 
 Let me tell another story, tell 'em about a 23 year old man that don't wanna fail every move he makes his hearts in it from the start to the finish 'cause losing ain't never ever been an option constantly cooking up plans and concoctions raised up in a place called Hoxton by his Nan and granddad, gets to see his mum on a weekend that was a treat then she was spoilt rotten and then its back to the east then. years later man will be sick with a big pen living in a place where the youths strap big lens pure drama a star performer leave the boost so hot you could call it a sauna 10 out of 10 I'm back at it again whatever the outcome its music to the end. 
 As life goes by in the blink of an eye I stayed focus on writing my rhymes these streets are inviting to crime if I didn't write rhymes and I'd probably go mad in my mind its 'cause only music that keeps me sane plus bud and to forget the pain just reflecting my days run away 
 Just another day in the life this music ain't paying me right like a worker at MacDonald's receiving minimum wage I get pennies for the shit that I've write on the pages like I'm feeling so what in slaved due to power and urban decay. there ain't no prospects in the uk today so my m8s keep playin' up the kane I don't know what I stand in the struggling and strain I'm trapped in the thunder and rain but I don't give a fuck for the fame so if I full pray to my sins then lust is to blame I'm in your ear like blood in your veins and yeah I'm on the rose like buskers and trains I'm just like everyone I love to be paid I'm messed up it must be the bud that I blaze there ain't nothing for us they way I'm feeling there ain't no word in the thesaurus born on the 7th of may I'm a Taurus can't keep my job 'cause I can't take orders I feel like I'm outside of the borders looking inside of the rich and the borders then I take a look around my headquarters and I'm ripping my hair out soon my heads gonna look like Gayle porters they hit us with extortion and treat illegal immigrants much more important than me and you 'cause I've lived there all my life and live got nuffin to show for it and you can't get rich from work so spitting I've gotta have a really good go at it I've put my boat in the stream and now I keep rowing it it's my dream I won't let go of it. 
 As life goes by in the blink of an eye I stay focus on writing my rhymes these streets are inviting to crime if I didn't write rhymes and I'd probably go mad in my mind its only music that keeps me sane plus bud and beers to forget the pain just reflecting my days run away
