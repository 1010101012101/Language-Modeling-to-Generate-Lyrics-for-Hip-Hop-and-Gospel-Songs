 Am I comin' for that number1 slot 
 Or will I come second

 I want more doe than David Beckham 
 My boys blaze zoots 
 And beers we neck 'em off 
 So you can suck out 
 'Cause I spit bars on the mike then I duck out 
 And if I'm in the place then get the fuck out 
 You come across me blood your lucks out yeah 
 And no I'm jus not givin' up 
 Na I don't give a fuck 
 Yeah I'm gunna live it up 
 So bring your boys an ill hit 'em up

 Everybody knows that your fake and your plastic 
 So please don't come with that wack shit

 You'll be getting dashed in the back of the transit 
 'Cause I've had enough of your antics 
 Your not a war boy 
 Na you're a prang bitch 
 And you don't bang clips 
 Your gay now you don't bang chicks 
 Ok now were gunna make chips 
 I've had enough of these little fake pricks yeah 
 And were lunatics so bring your boys 
 And we'll slew the pricks 
 Got more style than ludicrous 
 Ill merck your crew I'm not new to this 
 Spray like a magnum 
 The worlds deadliest handgun 
 I've been around son 
 I'm the quiet type I'm not a loud one 
 But if I feel blows I'm a loud one 
 And I spray like a mac 
 Fast repeatin an black 
 Automatic an that 
 Ill make your body movement erratic and that 
 I'm more ill than an asthmatic on crack 
 And I shoot like a shotty 
 Spit bars to your body

 Ill leave your body curled up in the lobby 
 Believe that's my hobby 
 Shoot like a tech

 We bun them hot bars to the neck yeah 
 You can't play the hero

 And yeah I'm De Nero 
 You must have wax in your ear hole 
 Told you not to spray with this weirdo 
 I'm weird because I spit the real shit 
 Stuff you can feel shit 
 Not about the steal clips 
 Who says crime never pays 
 Crime kings bling with rings round my ways 
 What they know about all night party's 
 Blazin' green at 7 in the morning 
 With hardly no snout in the zoot 
 And smoking kills but fuck the warnin 
 Wakin' up at 8 pm 
 Getting ready then doin' it again 
 Drinkin' bears blazin' peng 
 Scanckin out till 10am 
 Bring your boys I'm havin' 'em hung 
 Devlin yeah I'm that Dagenham scum 
 Simmy and fats there blazin' the zoots 
 With Joe French and the rest of the crew 
 The smoke goes through the stairs in the tower 
 Willsey has to reload every hour 
 Dagenham streets cold and sour 
 If the girls butters don't allow her na 
 Jus draw that protection 
 Roll that shit back down you erection 
 And your girls not terry she's ows 
 And sound boy your not havin' 1 segment 
 On this microphone I sense tension 
 Your styles long like your girls extensions 
 So here's a suggestion 
 Shut your boat less I ask you a question 
 I've got more than the tools of the trade 
 And I want rings with jewels and jus bade 
 And I wanna go Spain in the pool with the babes 
 Sip drinks in the cool and the shade 
 So I'm gunna start schoolin their face 
 Let 'em know that its wrong to be foolin your mates 
 I don't care if you rule in your gates 
 'Cause ill smash a tool in your face 
 And sound boy your small in this race 
 Your just a beginner blood I'm a winner 
 And I'm hungry for papes 
 Want them for breakfast brunch lunch and dinner 
 And I'm a joker like frank skinner 
 But if I switch then ill turn to a killer 
 I'm devastate boy iller for realer 
 I'm the white beast I'll be no gorilla 
 They say I ent got what it takes 
 But I spit real though not like the fakes 
 I'm on plot not leavin' a trace 
 I spit hot bring heat in the place 
 Yeah I'm young and I've made some mistakes 
 But I guess it's all trial and error 
 I'm devastation now is my error 
 So I'm gunna open my file of terror 
 Now its gunna rain ash from the heavens 
 Face kicked back while I start the massacre 
 In the drivin' seat I'm no passenger 
 Confidential like Kim Bassenger 
 Yeah and I'll be merck and harrasin ya 
 'Cause you ent ready for my minions 
 Low the short change gunna make the millions 
 Low the millions after the trillions 
 No I didn't have a good home life 
 Concentratin on me take a look at your own life 
 I've gotta flow right 
 Devastate white boy I'm my own type 
 Yeah believe that I'm my own fuckin' person 
 MC's I will merck em 
 It's my time best role back the curtain 
 You can tell your boys that ill burn em 
 Ill put a hammer in their sternum 
 And these swag might men 
 I've gotta teach and learn em 
 And if you want war ill merck your crew 
 Like England mercked the Germans 
 Yeah and you can tell your boys 
 Ill kidnap pimp and sell your boys 
 'Cause you ent nothing but fakes and snakes 
 See you on the rode wont give I just take.
