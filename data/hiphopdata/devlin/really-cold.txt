Show me who you know really flows 
 Show me who you know is really cold 
 Show me who you think is really in my zone 
 And I bet he's someone in the circle that I know 
 Show me someone that you think is spitting venom 
 I'll take his freedom in a sentence like a judge 
 Show me something that I don't know 
 Before it's too late, I came to wrap the whole game up 
 MCs, I should punch you in your mouths 
 You ain't from the streets, you spit shit on funky house 
 European dance mixed into trance 
 Can't feel safe with all the jewelry on your arms 
 I bet you no-one even knew you in your manor 
 Before you got a deal spitting swag bars 
 I put my manor on the map 
 And I've been running these streets for my young teens carving out a path 
 Forget modest, I've been modest too long 
 I buried you in freestyles, bodied you in songs 
 Call me Devs, call me Jim Laden, call me Kong 
 Beating on my chest, now it's time to get it on 
 Show me someone that you think I should be weary of 
 I'll grab his cranium and tear it off 
 To fill it full of thoughts, that'll make him think twice 
 'Bout stepping 'round the mic when I'm present, unfair or not 
 Show me who you know really flows 
 Show me who you know is really cold 
 Show me who you think is really in my zone 
 And I bet he's someone in the circle that I know 
 Show me someone that you think is spitting venom 
 I'll take his freedom in a sentence like a judge 
 Show me something that I don't know 
 Before it's too late, I came to wrap the whole game up 
 I see pop stars posing like rap stars 
 You ain't urban acts that's just what the facts are 
 In your videos posing in your flash cars 
 You don't even own, walk the street alone 
 And find you get moved to quicker 
 The mice inside of a pythons home 
 I guess I'm one of the few true spitters 
 The rest can't cut it, so slice 'em to the bone 
 System overload, is too late 
 I'm cracking up, smacking up, MCs who never run the road 
 Never bought an ounce of anything apart from gold 
 You ain't got no credibility, you bastards know 
 I've been a force within the underground 
 Since nights that I was writing at my mother's house 
 I've never been no type but big man 
 Just a little sick screaming out, fuck 'em now 
 Show me who you know really flows 
 Show me who you know is really cold 
 Show me who you think is really in my zone 
 And I bet he's someone in the circle that I know 
 Show me someone that you think is spitting venom 
 I'll take his freedom in a sentence like a judge 
 Show me something that I don't know 
 Before it's too late, I came to wrap the whole game up 
 Who the fuck told you it was fire you were spraying? 
 You know who you are, so do I, so what you saying? 
 Nothing 'cause your management would tell you not to speak 
 Mine would tell me burn 'em and then fight 'em in the street 
 Cash hungry vermin, I deprive 'em of their sleep 
 Scare 'em like a nightmare, the way I write the beat 
 Ain't a fan of vegetables, it ain't about the peas 
 As long as I'm the best within my field then I'm at ease 
 Underground, overground, Dev's might mow you down 
 In a vehicle that was stolen at your mother's house 
 My father ain't Samuel 
 But the way that I kill all these MCs, I feel like the summer Sam 
 Show me who you know really flows 
 I blow him back like I was rolling with a gun in hand 
 All I know is that there's not that many pros 
 So when I'm around I have to keep it really cold 
 Show me who you know really flows 
 Show me who you know is really cold 
 Show me who you think is really in my zone 
 And I bet he's someone in the circle that I know 
 Show me someone that you think is spitting venom 
 I'll take his freedom in a sentence like a judge 
 Show me something that I don't know 
 Before it's too late, I came to wrap the whole game up
