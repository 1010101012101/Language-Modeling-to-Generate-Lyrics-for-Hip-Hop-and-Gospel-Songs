Devlin, community outcast 
 And this one's for all the characters 
 That have been forgotten at the present time 
 I represent for the jobless 
 That have been made redundant 
 That have got four kids 
 And don't know how to fund them 
 Ever since the wife and the husband 
 Both lost their jobs at the office in London 
 Now they feel financially trapped 
 Now are locked with the rats in a dingy old dungeon 
 Take this young father of two 
 Signing on and the government 
 Says that his family are spongers 
 He's like, "Damn man 
 We ain't got a penny or a pound" 
 Let alone money for milk 
 And nappies and trainers and jumpers 
 He got taken off site 'cause it's cheaper 
 To pay Europeans to labor in numbers 
 How's he gonna take care of his younger's 
 I represent for the people 
 Let down by a nation 
 And left in the streets where it's evil 
 Little kids surrounded 
 By knives and heroin needles 
 I represent for the people 
 Let down by a nation 
 And left on the streets where it's evil 
 Community outcast, cold, tired and feeble 
 I represent for the homeless 
 Let down by a nation 
 More interested in war and invasion 
 When children are sleeping at railway stations 
 No home or money 
 They wish they could phone their mummy 
 To put a hot meal in their tummy 
 So at night when the temperature drops 
 I'm asking you remember what you got 
 These kids go home to a cardboard box 
 They're the soul survivors 
 Warming their hands 
 With their flickering flame of their lighters 
 All their life they've been frightened 
 On the streets with their head down 
 Knowing deep down inside 
 That they've really been let down 
 By a country that's crippled 
 And I thought mankind was supposed to be civil 
 I represent for the people 
 Let down by a nation 
 And left in the streets where it's evil 
 Little kids surrounded 
 By knives and heroin needles 
 I represent for the people 
 Let down by a nation 
 And left on the streets where it's evil 
 Community outcast, cold, tired and feeble 
 I represent single mums, all alone on their own 
 Tying to put food in the mouths of her two sons 
 And the fathers gone, there's no cash flow 
 Lack of income 
 But that's just the way it is 
 She counts fifteen needles 
 Pushing her pram on the way to the lift 
 And this is where Brown said 
 It's safe to live and raise kids 
 She finds her way out of the block 
 With two kids in a pram 
 And a rip and a stain in her top 
 She goes to sign on 
 Just to maintain the little she's got 
 For her kids sake 
 They'll never seen a decent life 
 But they can dream and they'll sleep tonight 
 They've been hung out and left to dry 
 The kids are in bed, mums left to cry 
 I represent for the people 
 Let down by a nation 
 And left in the streets where it's evil 
 Little kids surrounded 
 By knives and heroin needles 
 I represent for the people 
 Let down by a nation 
 And left on the streets where it's evil 
 Community outcast, cold, tired and feeble 
 I represent for the old folk that live alone 
 No family or kids at home 
 And all he wants is someone to speak to 
 But nobody thinks to phone 
 Sits at home in the dark, no electric 
 Since his wife passed, he can't accept it 
 He feels isolated, neglected 
 And now his council flats infested 
 So he goes to the shop for his papers 
 With his stick and he falls in the mud 
 The people around him all pulled him up 
 But to him that's just a reminder 
 He's old and he's weak with no one to love 
 I sees clouds up above 
 Another bad day in the diary 
 An old man one of many 
 Killed by society, strangled quietly 
 I represent for the people 
 Let down by a nation 
 And left in the streets where it's evil 
 Little kids surrounded 
 By knives and heroin needles 
 I represent for the people 
 Let down by a nation 
 And left on the streets where it's evil 
 Community outcast, cold, tired and feeble 
 I represent for the people 
 Let down by a nation 
 And left in the streets where it's evil 
 Little kids surrounded 
 By knives and heroin needles 
 I represent for the people 
 Let down by a nation 
 And left on the streets where it's evil 
 Community outcast, cold, tired and feeble
