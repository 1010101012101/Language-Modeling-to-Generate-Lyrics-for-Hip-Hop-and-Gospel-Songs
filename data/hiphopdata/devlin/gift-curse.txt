You want to see the best of me 
 You gotta see the worst of me 
 You wanna see the gift of me 
 You gotta see the curse of me 
 You gotta see the world I've seen 
 You gotta see the dreams I dream 
 Well, nobody sees me, no 
 The rise and fall 
 You gotta see what I've seen 
 Be where I've been to achieve these dreams 
 Be a team on a UK street 
 Scared for your life, can't change for the night 
 And the world's getting rootless 
 You got a red eye, everybody's on a height 
 And the matters got stupid, so have I 
 All you ever do is bring me down 
 I'm living up to the name you gave me tonight 
 And I am silent, that's why everybody wants me to live a lie 
 I ain't sure being thirty, I come from a place where the good die young 
 And the bad die when is their time, they say this to the face 
 Just know that my head's inside too well so my new name's to the face 
 You want to see the best of me 
 You gotta see the worst of me 
 You wanna see the gift of me 
 You gotta see the curse of me 
 You gotta see the world I've seen 
 You gotta see the dreams I dream 
 Well, nobody sees me, no 
 The rise and fall 
 I showed you the gift, let me show you the curse 
 You get big, then vultures emerge 
 And so called friends try pulling your beard 
 Once again, I gotta roll in the curb 
 And I try, but my life models 
 Prefer myself in many more qurels 
 So I seek salvation in words 
 So many votes, a gift and a curse 
 The reason I flower and grew 
 Might be the reason I feel malnourished and blue 
 I felt pain in the world 
 Now I just run through the chambers of hell 
 All I know is from an old man's view 
 I've seen some things so amazing in this world 
 Sometimes the grass is greener 
 Sometimes is quite hard to tell 
 You want to see the best of me 
 You gotta see the worst of me 
 You wanna see the gift of me 
 You gotta see the curse of me 
 You gotta see the world I've seen 
 You gotta see the dreams I dream 
 Well, nobody sees me, no 
 The rise and fall 
 Head in the sky, but my hands on the floor 
 Hard, but this night, will survive through this storm 
 You gotta see the world I've seen 
 You gotta see the dreams I dream 
 But nobody sees me at all, the rise and fall
