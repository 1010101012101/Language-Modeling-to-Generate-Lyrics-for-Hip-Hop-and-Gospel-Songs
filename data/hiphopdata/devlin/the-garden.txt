Welcome to the garden the HQ of Jim Lardon 
 Where weed trees grow around the things I leave departed 
 Got AKs in black bags you think were full of garbage 
 Guess again the weapons I've obtained are like Osama's 
 Who, by the way, is still alive, and stays to say hello 
 And told me to tell you all that he's just lying low 
 Then disclosed he was paid to take the blame 
 For what happened to the towers, so America could take control 
 I make the fans mosh, but this ain't rock and roll 
 Just a snip it of the craziness of life I know 
 Inside the grimey flow, I'll blow your mind to Idaho 
 You'll fly it back to return it to it's rightful home 
 I'm like a Warlord with lyrics, I've got much more than spirit 
 I'm trying to conjure up a spell and take control 
 Of every single area code across the globe 
 For every fairy tale told I tell it straight and bold 
 I'm something like a common cold 
 No one's found a cure for me, so I'll just hang around until it's time to go 
 And come back when I decide too 
 And play the synesses for viruses, like bird flu and swine flu 
 Or whatever's in line next that's been designed to 
 Kill her slowly within life's huge human zoo 
 It's Jay Lardon with a chete in your alley way 
 Don't ask me who I am, who the fuck are you, Buckaroo? 
 All my bars and rhymes move in syncrasy 
 Think of me as mother Mary boy you can't get into me 
 But I ain't virginal I'm dangerous to pussy holes 
 Who think that I won't step to them instinctively and sink my teeth 
 In their damn necks, take a rain check 
 Instead of blazing you I'd probably rather blaze the bless 
 But I'll be spraying to the day and date the game starts making sense 
 Won't stop until I'm dead 
 That's what I call going to grave extents 
 Bring me back to life in fifty thousand years 
 And I'll rain on whoever's rapping nice 
 Then kick back with a diet coke, jack and ice 
 See words for me swells within the devil's eyes 
 A never ending well of luster probably made me jealous, I 
 Throw my hands up, I admit 
 But I run up my lips a bit because I felt like I'm handcuffed 
 But now I've broke free, I'm never leaving bankrupt 
 Rappers think they're dead stiff like rigor mortis is 
 Just know I come hard like porn star performances 
 Norman of Normandy, I'll force you out your fortresses 
 Until you're hiding like your moonlighting as a contortionist 
 I've seen men collecting medals, I think we need to pause a bit 
 'Cause I ain't hating for the day that I start making soft songs son 
 I'll probably win an award for it 
 And for a spitter like myself that's what the bullshit is 
 Anyways, I'll never stray away for real 
 All I can do, I guess, is demonstrate the way I feel 
 The way I speak, the way I walk, the way I breathe, the way I meal 
 So real life's got me chasing that 2 stone still 
 I lost when diabetes, handed me my tombstone and fucking Will 
 Listen, I worked hard to get signed, but that's irrelevant 
 The point I'm trying to make's I never had a lucky deal 
 So all you inbreads can climb my money hill 
 'Cause D.E.V is on the hunt for money still 
 And then my hands ain't on the curb they're on the till 
 I'm O.T., you know me 
 Running through the whole scene, screaming Dagenham is ill 
 With young whippers snappers grabbing on the steel 
 What the fuck is with this manner chat will get you killed 
 Crack and smack is everywhere, just like the weed and pills 
 My backyard is too rough for Titchmarsh 
 Fuck all the little pricks that keep saying my name 
 You'll never be of ill 
 I've done everything you've done 10 times over 
 Forget everyone doing good things for the U.K 
 Nothing but love all day, let's make it happen 
 O.T our time, Devlin, A Moving Picture
