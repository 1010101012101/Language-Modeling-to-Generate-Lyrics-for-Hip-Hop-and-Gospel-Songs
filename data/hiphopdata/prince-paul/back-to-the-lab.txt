 Makin' up anythin' hes imaginin 
 There goes didi his sister 
 He always argues wit her 
 She thinks she knows it all 'cause she's older and she's bigger 
 What ever dexter wants he just goes and creates 
 Robots doesn't matter the size or da shape 
 Hes always doin' crazy tests or makin' a mess 
 And if they don't come out correct 
 Boy you know what happens next

 To get him into trouble or to get him out of it 
 Sometimes if he needs didi then hell just fuckin' use her 
 But dexters only true best friend is his computer

 Dexter wit all his new acting experience 
 So tune into dexter the worlds youngest inventor 
 You could join him for his crazy adventures
