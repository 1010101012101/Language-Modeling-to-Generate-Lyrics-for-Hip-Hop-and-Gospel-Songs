I've thrown away, I've thrown away again, tales that make me, 
 I've thrown away, I've thrown away again, 
 The chance to want to change, I've thrown away, 
 I've thrown away again, standing all alone, 
 I've thrown away, I've thrown away againnn! 
 Eyes wired shut, we're running through my brain, I'm pulling back the skin it happens, we're getting loner, 
 Eyes wired shut, we're running through my brain, it's all the same but in the end it keeps me coming! 
 I've thrown away, I've thrown away again, the fear of failing, 
 I've thrown away, I've thrown away again, the lies that make me sing, 
 I've thrown away the chance to make it righhhhhhttt!, 
 And I wanna be, and I wanna see, I wanna make it back to me! 
 Eyes wired shut, we're running through my brain, I'm pulling back the skin it happens, we're getting loner, 
 Eyes wired shut, we're running through my brain, it's all the same but in the end it keeps me coming! 3x
