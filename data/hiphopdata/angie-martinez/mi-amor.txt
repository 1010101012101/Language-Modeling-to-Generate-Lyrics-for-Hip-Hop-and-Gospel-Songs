*Chorus (Jay-Z (Angie Martinez))* 
 How you say "my love" in Spanish? (Mi amor) 
 (How you say "my love" in thug?) Can I hit it raw? 
 In the backseat of my jeep, or maybe on the floor 
 (Easy papi) Nah mami, teach me more 
 (Tr'teme especial means treat me special) 
 I ain't got no time for that now, dame un beso 
 (Wanna keep a good girl like I told you before) 
 (Easy papi) Yeah, teach me more 
 (Jay-Z) 
 I like fast cars, I love faster chicks 
 You don't need a small waist.I take ass and tits 
 Love chicks that deep throat, love being left alone 
 On a Sunday afternoon with the remote 
 Love having my cake plus eating it too 
 Shit, I got cake what the fuck I'm 'posed to do? 
 Like chicks to dress, but I love a good shoe 
 Sophisticated mama with love for the hood too 
 Love sexin girls on that boricua shit 
 Love black girls when the levi's fit 
 Chicks that play hard to get on that Aaliyah shit 
 If at first I don't succeed, then believe I split 
 Can you blame me? Young buck, dirty-ass pops trained me 
 Moms allowed it, Daddy was about it ('Bout it) 
 Game got inherited 
 Mama said if you find love you better cherish it 
 Teach me! 
 (Angie Martinez) 
 I like to slow dance, I liketo romance 
 I like to... stroll through the park holding hands 
 Ask me how my day was, tell me "Ma looking pretty" 
 On Sundays in the cut watchin "Sex and the City" 
 Having long talks and good lovin' in the morning 
 Walk them dogs when my body is callin 
 Fleash air force cuts a wound with a line 
 No stress of course, 'cause I don't have the time 
 Like to wine and dine but please hold your liquor, 'cause 
 I'm rollin' with ya and I hate a silly nigga 
 Like 'em rough and rugged, love it when you tug it 
 You buggin out of line on that thug shit its nothin' 
 Dealt with cats before that I had to train 
 Dealt with cats that's poor and a cat with fame 
 One who played basketball and I had more game 
 So por favor papi, stay in your lane
