(Little Girl) and you will never break me till the day I die 
 (Angie) 
 Yo every time I turn around they say 
 How I deal with that weak shit 
 I told y'all of the stages I can't agree wit 
 We showed y'all, promoted y'all 
 On how to freak shit ... 
 But here's a little secret... uh uh 
 We still number one 
 Blazin' hip hop and r&b quick 
 'Cause its simple and plain 
 How can you sit and complain quick 
 When we paid the way for you to 
 Get in the game chicks 
 Nigga's wuteva... its 
 Only the real that they recognize by the real 
 And since you don't recognize 
 U know the deal 
 How I feel? I don't 
 No emotionz get showed 
 If anything I feel violated being 
 That we been cloned 
 Reporterz quit, I don't get caught up in the mix 
 10 years deep, I wuz brought up in this shit 
 OG, big truck series, the carz is gone 
 Any questions? I'll be directing ur commentz 
 To alkatron... sing that shit 
 A primitive mind is all i 
 All I eva had 
 And you will neva break me 
 Till the day I die 
 My reputation and my name is superb 
 Now add that with animal house 
 And a flow that's like rain down a curb 
 'Cause I, write a verse and I change a few 
 Words, edit and perfected it ... 
 And and... 
 I'm still on the air 
 About the dough 
 Be clear, u gotta go 
 Each year we lock and load 
 Beware I'm outta control 
 Animal mode will let you know not to hand me no goal 
 Everything I write hot like mah hand on a stove 
 The ----- know bullshit don't effect me 
 Like a die hard knicks fan 
 So na mas if's and's 
 I could show you how power shit get ran 
 And I can't get budged 
 'Cause when ur best friend is the jury 
 Bottom line is you can't get judged and 
 That last line when ova ya head so 
 U'll prolly neva know till ur dead eitha way 
 Wut I said iz real, sing 
 A primitive mind is all i 
 All I eva had 
 And you will neva break me 
 Till the day I die 
 Uh yo uh... 
 And I'm not bein cocky 
 'Cause I work mah way up 
 And even tho it hurt 
 Neva gave up 
 Went from handin out fliers 
 To number one major... 
 I don't ---------------------- 
 I'm about dollaz, hold ur 2 centz saved up 
 Dropped mah first album 
 Neva rocc in mah life 
 Did everything on mah own 
 Wrote the songs, hit the mic 
 Get the beats all nice 
 Stayed up got it right 
 Minimal help, felt alone 
 Now you got a problem right? 
 'Cause its animal house, the team iz here 
 It's a new day with me this year 
 Be clear, I'm focused 
 Best coaches, way too many peeps 
 Pro to machines and way to much heat 
 Still grounded neva been way up in the sky 
 Workaholic still spend days inside 
 Angie you could neva break me, I move wise 
 And that's till the day I die, oh my god 
 A primitive mind, is all i 
 All I eva had 
 And you will neva break me 
 Till the day I die
