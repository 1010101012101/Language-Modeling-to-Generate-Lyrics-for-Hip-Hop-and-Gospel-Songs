He was all I wanted, late night talkin', 
 On the phone till daylight often, 
 At home he came through, dinner on the table, 
 Plate bites lost him, the love was strong then, 
 We went for walks then, then I lost him, 
 I mean he's still her but I ignore him, 
 'Cause hes too busy for me, 
 He comes around a few minutes then leave, 
 Things ain't the way they used to be, 
 Then I met this guy right down the street, 
 And this is what he said to me 
 Hello good lookin', tell me how are you, 
 Every time I see you baby, lookin' so 
 Good, let me show you girl, I can be so good 
 I tryed to work things out, bring things back 
 Arguments started, you don't know how to act, 
 Coulda brought up the fact, that today I met this new dude, 
 And I don't need ta say it, he probly woulda thought I was playin', 
 And he probly woulda said stop playin', 
 But this bullshit I'm about to stop, takin', 
 'Cause this new guy's about to drop, waitin, 
 I ain't playin', he played himself, 
 Need space need time, oh well, you can have all the space in the world, and 
 Your man might have found a new girl 
 Even though you don't know me, what can I do, 
 Let me see you girl, one Saturday afternoon, 
 Let me show you girl, I can be so good 
 Every girl need's affection, not somebody whos stressin, 
 Hope he learned his lesson, 'cause in one direction, 
 You can't see to the left and, you're stuck wit a dumb fuck, 
 Who don't understand that one truck, don't matta to you, 
 No car crib either, just you and him in a two seata, 
 But they always find out when it's too late, 
 Tellin' me to wait, no you wait, 
 Wait till you see me in his arms, 
 And understand that I'm gone 
 Hello good lookin', tell me how are you, 
 I see you girl, walkin' that avenue, 
 Let me show you girl, I can be so good
