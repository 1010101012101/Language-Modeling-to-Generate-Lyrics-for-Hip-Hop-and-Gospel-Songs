 Whoo! Cool and Dre, baby 
 Oh! (Laughing) 
 It's club but it's still sexy 
 Hey! Life is good 
 I need it louder 
 Yeah, man 
 What is that? 
 (Angie Martinez) 
 What's that sound? 
 If you outside the club, and your joint c'mon 
 You just pop the truck 
 Pull the car up and the line is packed, and you far 
 You tired a' waiting, you better be catch a charge like 
 "Move bitch, get out the way", flash the bouncer to get out a payin' 
 And that sound make you wanna get on stage 
 Oh, you gotta move dem thangs 
 Beat change 
 It's a Cool and Dre thing 
 That'll move your thang thang 
 Remove your ring 
 Change the sound 
 Get your jewels all sweated up 
 The booze is deaded up 
 Anything goes 
 Bring it back 
 If you just catchin' up 
 The sound coming outta the club, that's wassup 
 And they let you up 
 Finally you dancing it up 
 Movin' around, DJ Keith - (damn) 
 I need that sound 
 That new shit, that hot shit 
 Make you move shit - what's that sound? 
 That move crowds, that new sound 
 Make you can kick down - who's that chick? 
 That's Angie I'm manly 
 Screamin' Angie - what's that sound? 
 And this Missy gettin' tipsy off the whiskey 
 (Missy Elliott) 
 2002 be scared, 'cause I'm runnin' this shit this year 
 Haters 'n' haters you better be clear 
 Or you'll be kissin' my pussy on the rear 
 What I'm talking 'bout, with my filthy mouth, from the Dirty South 
 Is a drug-drop, c'mon check me out 
 Ain't nobody does it easy sleezy 
 And ain't nobody got the dick to sling me (owwww!) 
 God damn, what's that sound? 
 Didn't I tell you I'm about to shake it down? 
 I'm no punk, but I kill her like time 
 Get on the floor', yes yes m'am 
 When I show up the club get cram 
 Insecure bitch watch yo man 
 Me and Ang like butter on toast 
 I don't mean to boast, but we do 
 (Angie Martinez) 
 Hello? 
 Oh that's my ears ringing 
 I'm sitting here thinking that sound is still bangin' 
 As we leavin' the spot I'm still drinking 
 Gotta' leave cause the cops are still waiting 
 So we circle the block, as we workin' to blot 
 Then purposely watch - we so blingin' 
 And the truck is bright 
 Light up the night 
 Blinking, as we stuck in the chair feel like we sinking 
 That sound still drowned the air waves 
 The echo in my head feel like a bear cave 
 So I sit back to the sound of this track 
 Playin' on my way home - I can't forget that 
 That beat when you hear from the street 
 Make you wanna get on the floor and don't even speak 
 Cause it don't even matter who be around 
 Get... And that's DJ Keith - playin' that sound
