Featuring wyclef jean [wyclef jean] 
 Wyclef, chillin' with angie 
 Live at jimmy's, worldwide baby [chorus: wyclef] 
 Azuuuu-car! 
 Angie martinez, can I get a date on 
 Friday? 
 Suavemente, be-sa-me 
 Yo, yo, that's when a kid pulled the tec and the whole crowd parted 
 Why you fuckin' up the party before it gets started? 
 Suavemente, just when I thought she'd say yes... [angie martinez] 
 The way I flip it make you switch your shit to plan b 
 And I'dll be dipped out in the club lookin' fancy 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo it's angie 
 And we ain't chillin' too tough if you ain't family 
 You mad at me man please I'dm chillin' low-key 
 In the v.i.p. where everybody high fash-ion 
 That's why I got my little hat on 
 Gettin' they mack on, thirsty fo' satisfaction 
 And it's, bound to happen like latins goin' platinum 
 Now we, in it lookin' for the big peso 
 And my, song inspired by elvis crespo 
 And we, gettin' it started so baby let's go 
 Better, make it easy 'cause we livin' suave 
 Nasty boys in the party singin', "(??)" 
 Be 'bout the +smooth operators+ like sade 
 East l.a." [chorus] "coast 2 coast, new york to chicago [angie martinez] 
 It's three a.m. and we still ain't had enough (uh-huh) 
 Funny how times flies when you gettin' drunk (uh-huh) 
 See them niggaz pushin up, now you know they wanna (what?) 
 'Bout the time when everybody know whassup 
 See the big pop-pas chasin mu-cha-chas 
 Whylin out, right right, be like ooh-la-la 
 Like ha-ha-ha, ha-ha! 
 But they gets na-da, make me laugh ha-ha 
 They be, silly boys in brand new clothes (uh-ha) 
 Actin' up with nothin', puttin' on shows (uh-ha) 
 At the bar, frontin, strikin up a pose 
 In cubic zircon's like nobody knows, but 
 It's okay papi, I won't tell (uh-huh) 
 If they don't know you might as well 
 Do your thang duh-dah-dah-duh-dah 
 Pero suave yo! [chorus] - 2x [wyclef]
