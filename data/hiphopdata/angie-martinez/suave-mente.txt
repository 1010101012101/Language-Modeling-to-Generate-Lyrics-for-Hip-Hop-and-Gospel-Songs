(Wyclef) 
 Wylcef chillin' wit angie live at jimmy's 
 World wide baby azuca (sabroso) 
 (Chorus: wyclef) 
 Yo, suavemente besame 
 Angie martinez can I get a date on Friday? 
 Suavemente, just when I thought she'd say yes 
 Yo, yo that's when the kid pulled a check in the whole crowd party 
 Why you fucken up the party before it get started 
 *Angie says ya in different places in the chorus 
 (Angie) 
 Yo, it's angie the way I flip and make 
 You switch it in the flan be (flan be) 
 And I'll be dipped out in the club lookin' fancy (fancy) 
 And when your killin' 2 tub if you ain't family (I don't know you) 
 You mad at me, man please 
 I'm chillin' low key, 
 That's why I got my little hat on in 
 The v.i.p were everybody high fashion 
 Gettin' there mack on 
 34 satisfaction and it's bond to happen like latin's going platinum 
 Now we in and lookin' for the big peso and my 
 Song inspired by elvis crespo 
 And we gettin' it started so baby lets go 
 Nasty boys in the party singin' "dale huevo" 
 Pero take it easy 'cause we livin' suave, 
 We bout to smooth operators like sade 
 Coast to coast new york 2 chicago, east l.a. 
 (Angie) 
 Funny how time fly's when you gettin' drunk 
 It's 3 a.m & we still ani't had enough 
 'Bout the time when everybody knows what's up 
 See them niggaz pushin up now you know they wanna (what??) 
 See the papas chasin muchachas whillin out ra ra be like wo la la 
 Then they gets nada makes me laugh ha ha like ha ha ha ha ha 
 Baby silly boys in brand new clothes (hu ha) 
 Actin' up for nothin', puttin' on shows 
 At the bar frontin' strikin up a pose 
 Eatin cuban ciggaros like nobody knows 
 But it's ok papi I won't tell (hu ha) 
 If they don't know you mite as well 
 Do your thing ta ta ta ta ta pero suave yo 
 (Wyclef) 
 Suavemente (hu ha) 
 Suavemente (hu ha) 
 Suavemente
