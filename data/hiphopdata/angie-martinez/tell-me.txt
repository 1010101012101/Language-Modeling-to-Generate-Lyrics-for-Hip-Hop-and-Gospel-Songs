Mashitof 
 Remix 
 Yes yes, we stack money baby 
 Angie are you ready? 
 Lets go 
 Tell me, what you want (what you want baby) 
 Tell me, what you need (what you need baby) 
 And tell me if I'm good enough for you babe 
 Tell me what you want, tell me what you need 
 Tell me, what you want (what you want baby) 
 Tell me, what you need (what you need baby) 
 And tell me if I'm good enough for you babe 
 Tell me what you want, tell me what you need 
 How'd it happen, from pr to jamica 
 Its Angie mar superstar 
 Beenie man, man tell me whatchu want 
 Me I want more then 8 bars, more then one car 
 My nigga gotta call me ma 
 With good intentions and good injections 
 Me and Beenie new Caribbean connections 
 Rollin' large like terror squad, oh my god 
 Its on tell me what you want 
 Tell me, what you want (what you want baby) 
 Tell me, what you need (what you need baby) 
 And tell me if I'm good enough for you babe 
 Tell me what you want, tell me what you need 
 Tell me, what you want (what you want baby) 
 Tell me, what you need (what you need baby) 
 And tell me if I'm good enough for you babe 
 Tell me what you want, tell me what you need 
 More then 8 bars, good lookin' 
 Me again shorty reppin' basic fundamentals that you learn 
 In Brooklyn, look man, let me tell you something 
 'Bout me, a-n to the g-I-e 
 That would be double e, n-I-e 
 Said to be multi-talented I-e 
 I spell, rhyme and write see!
