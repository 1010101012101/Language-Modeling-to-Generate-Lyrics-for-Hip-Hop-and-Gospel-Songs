Every record label sucks dick (yeah!) 
 Every record label sucks dick (dick!) 
 Every record label sucks dick (ughyeeuh!) 
 Every record label sucks dick (dick!) 
 Every record label... 
 Every record label... 
 THEY SUCK DICK (sucks dick) 
 Fuck the new clothes sport shitty jeans 
 Fuck the limosines, when a Hoe Schemes, you end up with No Beans 
 There's only fifty thousand heads that are true to this 
 The rest are clueless to what real hip hop music is 
 Plus the labels think the artists are pathetic 
 I don't sweat it if they take the credit I'm a send um to the medic 
 The industry will gas ya head up, you ain't shit to them 
 Don't get fed up 'cause when you're down and out they won't help you get up 
 They sit around creatin' gimmicks, sky's the limits but to them its 
 Nothin' A&R men act like schizophrenics 
 Fuck the negative reviews, I sing the blues, 'cause if I blow up I still lose 
 Every record label sucks dick (yeah!) 
 Every record label sucks dick (dick!) 
 Now how could the musicians be the scholars 
 When they making less than four percent of six dollars 
 Most the kids that gig to rap just don't 
 Deserve opinions actin' like critics 
 Lookin' like richard simmons 
 Now they sportin timbalands 
 And I ain't tryin' to be accepted 
 But its hectic when ya trying to sell ya records 
 And your record label don't respect it 
 Now all these promotional stunts keeps me emotional 
 Not hospitable, I never recoup so it's not profitable 
 And I can end up as white trash, livin' in the trailer park 
 Eatin tuna fish with my cheese whiz 
 So howd you get your job in the black music department? 
 Since I was growin' up that's where my heart went 
 I won't be goin' out like kurt cobain, or tattoo 'Da Plane, Da Plane' 
 Jibba- Jaaaaane! 
 So if my sales don't succeed the expectations 
 My relation... ships will be uzi clips and decapitations 
 Cause the facts is technically, I need a vasectomy 
 No pregnancy, kids got the tendency to be sweatin me 
 So do ya own, them scumbags is makin' moneybags in the meantime 
 Your Karl Kani's turn to rags 
 Cause labels don't know shitty rappers from any rappers 
 So listen rappers they only know how to pinch a penny rappers 
 I end up bankrupt and penniless while you remain the rich man 
 My fist is up your ass to rip your lips off 
 This ain't the rock 'n' roll era so how could you know 
 What's worse or better chillin' in your polyester sweater 
 A big advancement doesn't make the move the wisest 
 Cause Def Jam offered more loot than Jive did 
 Every record label sucks dick 
 Every record label sucks dick (dick!) 
 Every record label sucks dick 
 Every record label sucks dick (dick!) 
 And the executives at labels they bout equal to McDonalds workers 
 They all down to jerk us try keep us poor on purpose 
 They expect that respect that they don't give 
 So don't think that it's negative if ya don't wanna let a record executive live 
 Now pretty bitches wind up givin' up they butts 
 But I'm used to bustin' nuts in stank perverted sluts 
 Just the thought of getting signed you masturbatin 
 Can't you see the industry is gold plated? 
 "He sounds like ice cube! Lets sign him! 
 He sounds like onyx! lets sign him! 
 He sounds like that shit that's hittin Let's sign him!" 
 God forbid I get HIV I be bitin people 
 And spitting blood at the entire music industry
