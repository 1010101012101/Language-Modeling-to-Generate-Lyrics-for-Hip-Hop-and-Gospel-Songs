No mistakes what you listening to 
 You listening to one of the all time greats 
 These are the breaks like Kurtis 
 Never heard this the way we disturbingly word shit 
 My dick spit flames, bitch, try not to get burned, bitch 
 I'm the master, the kingpin, do my thing, ring king 
 Put your gloves on, it's round 1, ding ding 
 Some of our G.O.A.T.'s passed on 
 Some of our illest lyricists sold out, they suck now, they're gone 
 Rugged Man, mamas keep your daughters away from his broke ass 
 No cash, looking for a place to crash 
 He just a dick-swinging dirt-bag, no class 
 Only fuck little, skinny, white bitches with no ass 
 The underground kill shit, my clique Paz, Killah Priest 
 Masta Killa, Kool G Rap, sick, lyrical beasts 
 Timbo King, Hell Razah, Tragedy Khadafi 
 And of course R.A. The Rugged Man, you can't forget about me 
 Big guns, hold up's, it's L.I.'s finest 
 Ten hut, uppercut, bow down to your highness 
 The legendary rhymer, howdy ha 
 Yeah, he walk through fire, la di da 
 Oh, who's that guy? He's so fly 
 That's what all my fat girls tell me, miss you, baby, love you, bye bye 
 Pretty bitches mostly hate me wishing I die 
 Oh wait, that was the past, bitches love me now 
 I don't know why they thinking they getting with a rap star 
 Handsome heartthrob, in reality they sucking the dick of a fat slob 
 I'm a star in the hood these days like Black Rob 
 My childhood fucked me up for real, I'm really that scarred 
 Let's get ready to rumble like Michael Buffer 
 You sold out, I saw what you did last summer 
 I'm a foul motherfucker like old school Slick Rick 
 With your wrinkled pussy I can't be your lover 
 This boom bip boom bap true funk 
 I'm from New York City, I do not get crunk 
 I'm so damn talented, I'm so damn gifted 
 I'm the Grand Puba, the Grandmaster, the Grand Wizard 
 Big guns, hold up's, it's L.I.'s finest 
 Ten hut, uppercut, bow down to your highness 
 The legendary rhymer, howdy ha 
 Yeah, he walk through fire, la di da
