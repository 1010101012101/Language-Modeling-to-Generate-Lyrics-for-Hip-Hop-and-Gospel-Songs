They used to call me Bobo, man 
 (J-Zone scratches) 
 R.A 
 He's rugged! 
 All right friends, on your feebles 
 (R.A.- Verse One) 
 Yo, see how they go, hip hop R-A-Hay-Oh 
 I'm a Special Ed. student, with an A+ flow 
 Used to call me Bobo, Buzzbee Burbley 
 Bronson, ?, Disco Derby 
 I'm a modern day Ozzy Osbourne 
 Bitin bats heads off and bustin' nuts in your pop corn 
 Wonderin how this ugly motherfucker got on 
 The whole white trash nation, rock rock on 
 Now wait a minute, let's bring it back a little bit 
 When you first started rappin', you was all on my dick 
 Yeah, you went multiplatinum, but you bit my shit 
 What you rappin' is my life, you ain't live that shit 
 See all the others say I'm twisted, and I'm over the edge 
 I'ma whole crew they stay ? off, and stick in their heads 
 Sledgehammer, break pay phones, still calling 
 Stay out the trouble, stay home, Rugged Man, J-Zone 
 (Chorus-R.A. sings) 
 Here we come from Suffolk County and you might not heard about me but we poor 
 (It's time for a showdown, between you and I) 
 You might not wanna be about me cause the shit's bout to get rawdy 'cause we brawl 
 (If we gonna do war, fuck 'em up fat) 
 Here we come from Suffolk County and you might not heard about me but we poor 
 (Come on sucker, let's get on) 
 You might not wanna be about me cause the shit's bout to get rawdy 'cause we brawl 
 (?? Fuckin' for troubles, 'cause we're gonna give it to ya) 
 (R.A.- Verse Two) 
 The way we recreate shit, Rugged Man 
 We don't make hits, we stay broke, sleep, fuck sluts and take shits (Ah-Ah) 
 And roll with the real life whores that appreciate dicks 
 Fuck they asshole, dick full of shit, taste bitch 
 It's easy to criticize me for being so vowel 
 It's worst when you lookin' down a shotgun bubble (BANG!) 
 They say, "Rugged Man, he can't keep no deal 
 His mental, I like the way being broke feel" 
 I'm at the homeless shelter, for nigling three meals 
 I'm like Buster Keaton, N.W.C. fields 
 I'ma die broke, no success 
 When I'll, die I'll chocked up, jerkin off like Inxs 
 Now wait, this is the place where stars are born 
 Strictly business, too potholes in my lawn 
 Uzi weights a ton, public enemy #1 
 Don't you dare sleep on the spot that we come from 
 (Chorus-R.A. sings) 
 Here we come from Suffolk County and you might not heard about me but we poor 
 (It's time for a showdown, between you and I) 
 You might not wanna be about me cause the shit's bout to get rawdy 'cause we brawl 
 (If we gonna do war, fuck 'em up fat) 
 Here we come from Suffolk County and you might not heard about me but we poor 
 (Come on sucker, let's get on) 
 You might not wanna be about me cause the shit's bout to get rawdy 'cause we brawl 
 (?? Fuckin' for troubles, 'cause we're gonna give it to ya) 
 (R.A.- Verse Three) 
 Yeah, it's true motherfuckers, I'm alive and shit 
 The mainstream motherfuckers, tryin' to hide my shit 
 You hate a man's rap flow, I invented that shit 
 You see hoes on stage show, I invented that shit 
 They say I could have been, but I never been 
 That's bullshit, I'm a underground rap letterin 
 I'm like get-get-get-get, get off my dick 
 I'm the wrong kid you don't wanna fuck with 
 Call me Big Dog, Mr. Crustified Dibbs 
 When I think to all the devious things I did 
 This is a hold up, catch your ass all ? up 
 Bitch drink cum, when this fat fuck roll up 
 Yeah, six million ways to die, choose one 
 True hoodlum, true ?, I'm the sequel 
 Fuck Mandingo, you can call me drum 
 Stupid dumb, Long Island hoodlum 
 (Chorus-R.A. sings) 
 Here we come from Suffolk County and you might not heard about me but we poor 
 (It's time for a showdown, between you and I) 
 You might not wanna be about me cause the shit's bout to get rawdy 'cause we brawl 
 (If we gonna do war, fuck 'em up fat) 
 Here we come from Suffolk County and you might not heard about me but we poor 
 (Come on sucker, let's get on) 
 You might not wanna be about me cause the shit's bout to get rawdy 'cause we brawl 
 (?? Fuckin' for troubles, 'cause we're gonna give it to ya) 
 (Scratches) 
 R.A 
 He's, He's rugged 
 Fuck 'em up fat
