 Hardcore white, bar brawl type, American lowlife 
 Sneak in your crib past midnight 
 Sticking dick in your wife, I'm a dirty boy 
 Eat the pussy out all night, hit the whore right 
 Vietnam war like, lose your life, white trash shit 
 I'm the fat fuck version of Brad Pitt 
 Glock cock shit, take you out, 2Pac shit 
 Real rap shit, bloodshed, bloody axe shit 
 I'm the stick dick in your face type, hate bright daylight 
 Hate life, steak knife, gang fight, waste life 
 I'm the barbarian ape type, brutally rape, take life 
 You ain't safe late night, daddy Warbucks, no dough shit 
 No folks shit, no hope, homeless broke shit 
 Dynasty Ayatollah, flamethrower 
 Rugged man tie you up, blindfold ya, it's all over

 Or focus, without wondering, where the coke is

 Papi, you might die right now 
 Can't afford legal services 
 Court appointed is leaving niggas nervous 
 I heard it's a long road to travel 
 And there's glass in the gravel 
 Still I press on, with the vest on 
 With Avirex and guess on, I gets down to business 
 I guess it gets down to physical fitness 
 Leaving you niggas out of breath 
 With right to left, I'm quiet as kept 
 But I rep, blow the smoke, stick my neck out the
