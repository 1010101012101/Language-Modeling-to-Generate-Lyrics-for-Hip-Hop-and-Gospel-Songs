Hand on the Bible, gotta hide though from the five-o 
 Shut your piehole, get your eyes stole 
 Ain't no industry devil ever getting my soul 
 I be the belligerent militant until I die, yo 
 Be like '88 Bobby smash tender Roni's 
 I'm a master at mastering ceremonies 
 Hit the bitch with the bad weave till she can't breathe 
 In the garden of Eden I'm Adam, pimpslap Eve 
 You should win an award for real when you're rapping 
 Get a gold statue an Oscar for acting 
 Your ignorance limitless when you live in abyss 
 You looking like Cool J when he licking his lips 
 Lay in a bloody bath water when you're slitting your wrists 
 If it isn't a diss, bitch, then you get in ya ditch 
 I'll might put a bullet in the cop; bigot 
 White boy slam, dance mosh pit-ed 
 Rob your mama house to lock pick it 
 Lucked out if you thrown out; slit it 
 I'm the underdog Cinderella Man James Braddock 
 A pain addict, it ain't matter till your brain severed 
 I'll be kicking your dick until your dick piss puss 
 I was given a gift like Kringle on Christmas 
 I'mma live my life, no consequences 
 Grab the barb wire, hop the fences 
 Indie rap fans, a lot are pretentious 
 Talk hip hop, but never got in the trenches 
 Bitch, ha 
 Bang, bang, boogie, the boogie, the beat
