Yo, yo 
 I will not stop runnin' till I'm winning the race 
 I can't live with myself being in second place 
 (R.A. the Rugged Man) 
 Ay yo, here's a little story, something for your ear 
 Like the new millennium version of Paul Revere 
 Except this ain't fiction, this is real life here 
 I be 30 years old in even less than a year 
 Yeah I made my mistakes, yeah I paid my dues 
 Hated by blacks, made enemies with jews 
 I was 7 years ahead of my time in '92 
 I said things that wasn't accepted till '99 
 It's awful, I don't care about the past no more 
 I don't wanna get rich, trust me, I'd rather be poor 
 Now think about it, notice how I never shown my face 
 I don't really want fame, I just want my space 
 Yeah, I had hard times like Run-DMC 
 But actually I feel pretty blessed just to be me 
 I never seen the penitentiary 
 I've been shook since I seen the Haiti kid in Penitentiary 3 
 They say I should have been more, I should have been great 
 Like I'm washed up now, like it's already too late 
 I can feel all the hatred when I walk in the place 
 But y'all are too scared to say shit to my face, it's 
 Midnight (repeated several times) 
 I'll come for you 
 When the clock strikes midnight 
 I'll come for you 
 (R.A. the Rugged Man) 
 Ready for hell, ready for war 
 Yeah, it's nice to be loved but I like being hated more 
 All the sudden magazines give me good reviews 
 It used to be my name on the equal bad news 
 All the sudden I'm a genius, all the sudden I'm bright 
 Like I just now became intelligent overnight 
 I be as 1990 grimey as I could be 
 And finally society can see admiring me 
 And finally dirty dirty boy, dirty b 
 Wordy wordy free, dirty boy 
 Yeah that's me 
 My father specialist 5th class Thornburn John A 
 A Vietnam war hero, green beret 
 Taught me how to shoot guns and taught me how to fight 
 Throw the left hook and throw the uppercut with the right 
 Taught me all about bitches, they can ruin your life 
 Like in his prime, look what happened to Iron Mike 
 People wonder what it's like and how is to be me 
 The most underrated in hip hop history 
 Think I care if you disagree? 
 You ain't got no song out 
 And right now you're busy listenin' me
