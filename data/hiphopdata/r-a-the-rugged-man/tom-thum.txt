I got a big head and a fat ego 
 I got the starving and hungry poverty superiority flow 
 My pistol is old school class, I'm peeling your ass fast 
 Yo, I'm uncontrollably gifted, I totally ripped it 
 I'm vocally vicious 
 Naming the best ever, I'm supposed to be listed 
 Even if I'm emotionally and overly twisted and socially timid 
 And every chick had left with a broken ovary when I hit it 
 The fans follow me like disciples, I'm Charlton Heston 
 Not the Moses version, I'm the gun toting version with the rifles 
 Don't let them crabs gash you 
 When I'm jacking a rapper and ripping the jacket 
 And patching your ass and using a machete to smash you 
 I'll rob anyone, anywhere, under the jacket, get the flame up 
 Pull the gun out at your wedding while your grandma do the macarana 
 All these feminine rappers wanna see me dead and buried 
 Too many rappers is drag-queened out; Tyler Perry 
 Sick of the similar imitating 
 I did it already to pitifully paint 'em 
 The bigger the better, debate 'em 
 You biting what I'm spitting, you already verbatim 
 I don't need to breathe when I rap, I got gills, fuck lungs 
 I'm like a superhero out of the toilet of the slums 
 Come on 
 Every verse like a firearm 
 Blasting ya 
 I'm the greatest! 
 You ain't shit 
 Compared to me 
 Shacking up for the night at the crib with a B-movie actress 
 Shocking next to the bed and the wad of cash under the mattress 
 As a kid I wasn't into theatrics 
 After school my daddy used to teach me combative Green Beret tactics 
 My flow natural, you artificial, beefed up Barry Bonds at BALCO 
 Dope or dog food? I spit heroin, your rhymes are alpo 
 I ain't into the tight jeans 
 I'm into bar brawls, brass knuckles, and bloody fight scenes 
 The mainstream pussies ever give me props? No, nada 
 That's like the Fox News giving props to Obama 
 Wait, I teach the children and the world the word hate 
 I eat pussy 'til every dyke on the Earth turn straight 
 I'm disturbing with the grammar 
 I'm more disturbing than bombing the baptist church of Birmingham, Alabama 
 I've been repping 
 I'll put a hit on any paper that my pen blessing 
 I'm nice with the hands, each fist is a registered weapon 
 I'll leave you forever rested 
 I don't care if you're beefed up on steroids or what you bench pressing 
 I'm at the Best Western and tossing your girl salad with some French dressing 
 Hit you with a batter of hatchets in the back of a ratchet 
 My flow, ain't a rapper that match it 
 Too much lyricism too digest, I do it on purpose 
 Two of my bars is more lyrical than two of your verses 
 Come on 
 Every verse like a firearm 
 Blasting ya 
 I'm the greatest! 
 You ain't shit 
 Compared to me 
 I tour the world 
 You're at home with your momma 
 I get ass 
 Every night you get no ass 
 Suck my balls, and choke on my dick you bitch 
 You ain't shit 
 Compared to me
