Proud to be poor 
 Proud to be what? Proud to be who? 
 Poor people, poor people, poor people, poor people 
 Proud to be poor 
 Proud to be what? Proud to be who? 
 Poor people, poor people, poor, poor, poor people... 
 Y'all don't want this, Rugged Man take no shit 
 Notice you fake y'all just go where the dough is 
 We do this for the poor people cats that are homeless 
 My whole clique roll thick roll with strictly broke kids 
 Hopeless, y'all can't even see what the truth is 
 We ain't give two shits ruthless rugged 
 New shit, you ain't think that I can fuck you bitch 
 You ain't think you roll with us you'll be sucking dick 
 Lack politeness like this don't act like 
 The typical stereotype so what's whiteness 
 Being grimey greasy that's what being white is 
 I got a bitch with a flat ass and I like it 
 I like big breasts and I like to lick vaginas 
 And fucking bitches on dumpsters in the back of diners 
 Everything we do is white trashing razor blade 
 To the wrist 'cause we hate life with a passion 
 Proud to be poor 
 Proud to be what? Proud to be who? 
 Poor people, poor people, poor people, poor people 
 Proud to be poor 
 Proud to be what? Proud to be who? 
 Poor people, poor people, poor, poor, poor people... 
 I like being broke I like being dirty crusty 
 Proud to be poor I like being fat and ugly 
 I like not succeeding I like beefing I like 
 Bleeding I like starting fights for no reason 
 Bad temper no patience shit on ya floor 
 Stick ya face in it make you lick the raisins 
 Everybody on this hip hop dick makes me sick 
 Seeing chicks like Mariah doing hip hop shit 
 I don't care if they think I'm sexist I don't care 
 If I talk about the same shit on every record 
 And with this gimmicky pop rapping the way that P. Diddy 
 And Will Smith be getting jiggy 
 I'd rather not take showers and smell shitty 
 Born to be poor we born poor we die poor 
 I rhyme for the low down scummy 
 I rhyme for the true hoodrats that ain't ashamed to look bummy 
 Understand that, where ya man at we blow ya head 
 Backwards we Linda Blair that we rugged man that 
 You better watch out, don't talk that you fake that 
 Fakeness take that with ya platinum plaques 
 Proud to be poor 
 Proud to be what? Proud to be who? 
 Poor people, poor people, poor people, poor people 
 Proud to be poor 
 Proud to be what? Proud to be who? 
 Poor people, poor people, poor, poor, poor people... 
 If you got no place to live, if you ain't got no job, if you ain't got no dough (Let me hear you say) 
 I'm broke as fuck (I'm broke as fuck) I'm broke as fuck (I'm broke as fuck) 
 If you a piece of shit and you proud, and ya whole squad ain't worth shit 
 And you ain't got shit (let me hear you say) 
 I'm broke as fuck (I'm broke as fuck) I'm broke as fuck (I'm broke as fuck) 
 Proud to be poor 
 Proud to be what? Proud to be who? 
 Poor people, poor people, poor people, poor people 
 Proud to be poor 
 Proud to be what? Proud to be who? 
 Poor people, poor people, poor, poor, poor people...
