I just want to be famous 
 I just want the world to love me 
 TV Reporter 
 : 
 And this just in 
 Tom Cruise and Will Smith are buttbuddies 
 Back to you gentlemen 
 Block McCloud 
 : 
 Top celebrity, top celebrity 
 Top celebrity, top celebrity 
 I'll make you famous 
 R.A The Rugged Man 
 : 
 Hmm, so you wanna get your ugly face on TV? 
 Wanna be a superstar, wanna be a top celebrity 
 Too short to be a ball player, too ugly to be an actor 
 Too dumb to sell drugs and now you're trying to be a rapper 
 Now all you gotta do is shake hands with the devil 
 Maybe lick a little, uh, penis, I'm for real on the level 
 If you take a dick you could make a hit 
 You could jack the styles of underground rappers and claim you've created it 
 You could get cash and be massive 
 You could be worshipped and be a tool for the corporations 
 And help them gain control of the masses 
 Make sure you make more hits, product placement, packaging products 
 So poor people could make corporations more rich 
 Block McCloud 
 : 
 I'll make you famous 
 I'll take your kids, your rhymes, your blood, your life, your soul 
 Top celebrity, top celebrity 
 Top celebrity, top celebrity 
 I'll make you famous 
 R.A The Rugged Man 
 : 
 Society, celebrity obsessed 
 Shock value, Janet pulling out a breast 
 Gaga wearing a meatmaggot infested dress 
 You don't need talent to be worshipped when you walk in a building 
 They'll praise you if you ain't shit 
 But you rich and your parents own the Hilton 
 More and more people are becoming non-believers 
 In a world where your children 
 Know more about Snooki then they know about Jesus 
 And in the hood there's more pressure 
 'Cause if you're a black actor in Hollywood 
 They try to make sure you become a crossdresser 
 We like Martin running through traffic, butt-naked with a gat 
 Or little Britney shaving her head, beating up cars with a bat 
 Don't forget during your journey of dreamchasing 
 You should promote Illuminati images, pretend to be a Free Mason 
 Worshipping witchcraft and satanic scriptures 
 RnB divas posing as baphoment, goats and pagans in pictures 
 Don't try to help the neighborhood, they're broke, the don't feed you 
 And who cares if the babies are dying? They don't really need you 
 The ladies love you now, you're large 
 Till a lying ass gold digger show up at your hotel 
 And you catching a rape charge 
 So black people, don't be stupid 
 Stop letting white lawyers, business execs 
 And white accountants dictate your music 
 I just want to be famous 
 I just want the world to love me 
 R.A. The Rugged Man 
 : 
 Now BET got bought out, let me explain briefly 
 Now it's WET, white entertainment TV 
 Viacom, Time Warner and Disney 
 Those the true dictators of black music, hip hop and RnB 
 They're politicing your careers 
 They could set you up and you could get murdered 
 And your murderer just mysteriously disappears 
 Try to get murdered, take note, rappers 
 Cause getting killed can turn an average artist 
 With above average talent to GOAT status 
 Female entertainers, you losing the race 
 God forbid you get a wrinkle, go see the surgeon, hurry and mutilate your face 
 Some times you gotta come from the struggle and suffer 
 Other cases your dad can be OJ's lawyer 
 And you can fuck Brandy's little brother 
 I just want to be famous 
 I just want the world to love me
