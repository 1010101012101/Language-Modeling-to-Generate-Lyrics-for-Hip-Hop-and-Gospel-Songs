Radio speaker : Yeah baby, it's Phil ? live at Night Talk 
 We're talkin' about musical genius R.A. The Rugged Man 
 Let's take some calls, find out what you guys think 
 # 1 Caller: Yo, R' s definitely one of the illest liricist I've ever heard, that's real 
 # 2 Caller: R.A. man, he's comin' out, guns blazin' baby, BOOM, watch out 
 # 3 Caller: He's very intelligent, he's a positive model in rap 
 # 4 Caller: I went to a show last week, he was the bomb... He was better than Michael Jackson 
 # 5 Caller: He's so sexy, My girl said he has an 11 inch cock, couldn't walk? 
 # 6 Caller: Yo R.A. is worldwide man, he's goin' platinum, quadruple, and big time 
 # 7 Caller: First time I saw him, I knew he had a star quality, he's a superstar 
 Ayyo, here's the whole story, the whole true, "He's retarded" 
 Here's how my whole bullshit career started 
 Back in '88 it was about battle rappin' and shootin' guns off 
 At house parties, say "HO" (BANG! BANG!BANG!) ? before rhymin' 
 No complainin', no money, no fame, still maintainin' 
 1991, now my whole career started bustin' 
 You see in on stage shows, guess the crowd jump in 
 Let the kids come on 
 Tommy Boy, Mercury, Priority wanted me 
 Russell Simmons, and 9 other record companies 
 Sendin limousines out to pick up my broke ass 
 Feedin' me stakes, buyin' me hookers, I hope that shit last 
 I was used to have no cash, I got gats 
 White trash, why they wanna sign my ass? 
 '92 the whole industry was on my dick 
 I signed to Jive Records, and fucked up the whole shit 
 You're a shinin' star 
 You're a superstar 
 Ooh... 
 Large star 
 But you gonna be large 
 You're a shinin' star 
 You're a superstar 
 Ooh... 
 Yeah, right 
 Now I'm stuck on a wack label 
 They say, "You see the way you behave 
 Now wonder why the label hate you" 
 They say "He's a beast, he's a creature 
 Keep him in the other room, don't let him see Aaliyah" 
 Banned from the building, I don't wanna see? 
 "He just don't know how to play the game right 
 He could be large than life" 
 They try to turn the label caucasian 
 They signed me, Whitey Don and the Insane Clown Posse 
 And they signed the Backstreet Boys and Britney 
 It's a pop label, what the fuck they want with me 
 Forget R. Kelly, I' ma do that rippin' out your cunt shit 
 I flipped the fuck out and did some dumb shit 
 ? Looked at me, I got a gun shit 
 I ain't gonna give that commercial run hit 
 Instead I gave your label suck dick 
 Try to press charges against me 
 Suited me, blackballed me 
 My lawyer wouldn't even call me 
 You're a shinin' star 
 You're a superstar 
 Ooh... 
 Large star 
 But you gonna be large 
 You're a shinin' star 
 You're a superstar 
 Ooh... 
 Large star 
 You're a shinin' star 
 You're a superstar 
 Ooh... 
 Large star 
 But you gonna be large 
 You're a shinin' star 
 You're a superstar 
 Ooh... 
 Yeah right 
 '95, I'm broke out the ass, no doe 
 Watchin' everybody else around me blow 
 Trackmasters, Mobb Deep, Keith Murray 
 Biggie and Puff, I'll admit it, I was jealous as fuck 
 I was so pathetic 
 No doe under ugly chick 
 With a no doe fetish, all my old hoes jetted 
 Went from hearin' "You're a star kid" 
 To hearin' "He ain't talented, he's garbage" 
 ? Shitty ? there's no market 
 '96, I got a gun now 
 I remember I was bout to kill Jeff Henster 
 Moved back in with pop duke 
 And my handicapped brothers and sisters, and we had no loot 
 That's when the Feds came by 
 And surrounded the house 
 They had automatic weapons, and was pullin' 'em out 
 And the moral of the story is 
 All that glamour and glitz shit (what?) 
 Fuck that shit, I don't need it 
 You're a shinin' star 
 You're a superstar 
 Ooh... 
 Large star 
 But you gonna be large 
 You're a shinin' star 
 You're a superstar 
 Ooh... 
 Yeah right
