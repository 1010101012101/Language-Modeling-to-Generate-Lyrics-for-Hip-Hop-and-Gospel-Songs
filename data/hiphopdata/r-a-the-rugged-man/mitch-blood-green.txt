They say snitches get stitches 
 You snitch or you hit me, hit me, hit me 
 You fucked up 
 You see, we sit here in jail, right? 
 They sit over the phones and TV 
 That's where they, that's where they argue and fight over the most 
 Who gon' use the phone, they stressed out 
 They got, see that's why, that's why back in the day in the 80's 
 Guys go to jail, only had one phone 
 Ready, ready, Rugged, you gotta grab that cup 
 All that rioting and fighting and all of that shit 
 Now they got like four 
 But they got a Muslim phone, Peruvian phone, a regular phone 
 Got all of them phones to keep down, to keep down the peace
