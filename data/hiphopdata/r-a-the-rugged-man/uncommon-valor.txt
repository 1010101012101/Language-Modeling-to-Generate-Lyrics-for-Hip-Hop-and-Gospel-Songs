Richard Nixon (US Government PSA) 
 : 
 I have spoken to you from this office, where so many decisions have been made that shaped the history of this nation. I have always tried to do what was best. (Duck... and cover!) 
 Vinnie Paz 
 : 
 I don't know why I'm over here, this job is evil 
 They sent me here to Vietnam to kill innocent people 
 My mother wrote me, said: "The President, he doesn't care" 
 He trying to leave the footprints of America here 
 They say we trying to stop Chinese expansion 
 But I ain't seen no Chinese since we landed 
 Sent my whole entire unit, thinking we could win 
 Against the Vietcong guerrillas there in Gia Định 
 I didn't sign up to kill women or any children 
 For every enemy soldier, we killing six civilians 
 Yeah, and it ain't right to me 
 I ain't got enough of motherfucking fight in me 
 It frightens me, and I just wanna see my son and moms 
 But over here they dropping seven million tons of bombs 
 I spent my days dodging all these booby-traps and mines 
 And at night praying to God that I get back alive 
 And I'm forced to sit back and wonder 
 Why I was a part of Operation Rolling Thunder 
 In a foxhole with nine months left here 
 Jungle like the fucking harbinger of death here 
 Vinnie Paz + R.A. The Rugged Man 
 : 
 I don't wanna be here, I'm scared, I just wanna go home 
 You fucking kidding me?! Don't be a pussy! 
 Don't you love your country? I like being here, I'm ready 
 R.A. the Rugged Man 
 : 
 True story, call me Thorburn, John A., staff sergeant 
 Marksman, skilled in killing, illing, I'm able and willing 
 Kill a village elephant, raping and pillage a village 
 Illegitimate killers, U.S. Military guerrillas 
 This ain't no real war, Vietnam shit 
 World War II, that's a war, this is just a military conflict 
 Soothing drug abusing, Vietnamese women screwing 
 Sex, gambling and boozing, all this shit is amusing 
 Bitches and guns, this is every man's dream; I don't wanna go home where I'm just an ordinary human being 
 Special Op, Huey chopper gun ship, run shit 
 Gook run when the minigun spit, won't miss 
 Kill shit, spit four-thousand bullets a minute 
 Victor Charlie, hair-trigger, hit it, I'm in it to win it 
 Get it, the lieutenant hinted, the villain, I been it 
 The killing, I did it, cripple, did it, pictures I painted is vivid 
 Live it, a wizard with weapons 
 The secret mission, we 'bout to begin it 
 Government funded, behind enemy lines 
 Bullets is spraying, it's heating up a hundred degrees 
 The enemy's the North Vietnamese, bitch please 
 Ain't no sweat, I'm told be at ease 
 Until I see the pilot got hit, and we 'bout to hit some trees 
 Tail rotor broke, crash land 
 American man in Cambodia, right in the enemy hand 
 Take a swig of the Whiskey to calm us 
 Them yellow men wearing black pajamas, they wanna harm us 
 They all up on us; bang, bang, bullet hit my chest, feel no pain 
 To my left, the Captain caught a bullet right in his brain 
 Body parts flying, loss of limbs, explosions 
 Bad intentions, I see my best friend's intestines 
 Pray to the one above, it's raining, I'm covered in mud 
 I think I'm dying, I feel dizzy, I'm losing blood 
 I see my childhood, I'm back in the arms of my mother 
 I see my whole life, I see Christ, I see bright lights 
 I see Israelites, Muslims and Christians at peace, no fights 
 Black, Whites, Asians, people of all types 
 I must've died, then I woke up, surprised I'm alive 
 I'm in a hospital bed, they rescued me, I survived 
 I escaped the war, came back, but ain't escape Agent Orange 
 Two of my kids born handicapped 
 Spastic, quadriplegia, micro cephalic 
 Cerebral palsy, cortical blindness - name it, they had it 
 My son died, he ain't live 
 But I still try to think positive, 'cause in life, God take, God give
