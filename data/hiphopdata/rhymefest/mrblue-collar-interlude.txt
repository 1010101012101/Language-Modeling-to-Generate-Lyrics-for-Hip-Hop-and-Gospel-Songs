 (Ay man get you bad ass over here and listen to what these 
 People got to say) 
 (Wild hundreds whasup, Chitown)

 Imagine you was hustlin' 
 The romans came in 
 And somehow you was able to evade the search 
 (All right now) 
 (Come on son)

 (Hmm) 
 Maybe its time for you trade in merch for a blue collar 
 (Man I ain't workin' no job) 
 'Cause even if you is hustlin' you gonna need a job on the side 
 And if you are payin' paul, then peter get robbed on the side 
 (Teach)

 If you been in perpetual, continuous grind mode 
 And only been able to get small stacks on 
 Then you need somethin' to fall back on 
 (Mmhmm)

 But we the people they talk tall smack on 
 (Come on, come on)

 And tellin' you that all the blacks and latinos is out here smuggling 
 When the vast majority of minorities 
 Got two jobs, a career, and family time 
 They jugglin', strugglin' to keep adulthood from kickin they rear 
 (Yes sa, yes sa) 
 (Sho we do, sho we do) 
 This chapter is for chicken and beer 
 Some kicks and some gear 
 The money for the whip and the tip we keep over here 
 We try to take a trip a year 
 Cause you gonna need a vacation from all the hatin' 
 And the pigs tryin' to put a seam in your wig 
 (Tell em, boy you tellin' 'em right)

 (You tellin' 'em right) 
 Because you have two things a flow and some kids
