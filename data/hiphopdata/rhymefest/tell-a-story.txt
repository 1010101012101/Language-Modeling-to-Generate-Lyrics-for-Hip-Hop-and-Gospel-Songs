This is your life yo 
 You got ups and you got downs man 
 You got downs and you got ups 
 We all go through the same thing on different days 
 Man don't act like you ain't like me 
 What you don't put your pants on one leg at a time 
 What's going on with you playa 
 Let me tell you somethin' man 
 I'm ready to tell you about your life on this one look at here 
 These the things we all go through 
 It's everyday life for me and you 
 Don't feel bad 
 Don't feel bad 
 Things that happen everyday 
 Around the world or around the way, we just... 
 Just tell a story 
 Tell a story 
 Where can I start 
 Start at the part 
 Me at the part 
 Playin' this part 
 Provin this role 
 Waitin on old? 
 Just got fronted at eight for that blow 
 Now you burn the pot 
 Watch me rock 
 Back on the block 
 With a few in the sock 
 Doing the heavy 
 Cops in the chevy 
 Scopin his every move already 
 Smooth and deadly 
 Cool his belly 
 Probably get popped right in front of the deli 
 The ghetto to mallon 
 His tools was heavy 
 His crew was ready 
 To do whatevy 
 Got juice but not tryin' to turn in the power 
 Ain't burnin the pot 
 Now you watch me rock 
 Chop drop swap cop 
 Chop drop swap cop 
 Chop stop you cop we cops 
 Swallow that working end of the glock 
 Only thirteen ain't know what it mean 
 But he lovin' the green the American dream 
 His momma says stop his father was hot 
 Couldn't just stop 'cause he coulda got shot 
 They move him down south to straighten him out 
 And he's still selling dope by the big warmer house 
 What you gon' do when it's all up to you 
 Stuck in this cell with nothing to do, but... 
 Just tell a story 
 Tell a story 
 These the things we all go through 
 It's everyday life for me and you 
 Don't feel bad 
 You feel that 
 Things that happen everyday 
 Around the world or around your way, we just... 
 Tell a story 
 Tell a story 
 Jenny was bad she stayed on suspension 
 Hung around guys she liked that attention 
 Give her daddy an honourable mention 
 He wrote her letters while he was in prison 
 Brother ain't home 
 Momma was gone 
 Working them doubles now she all alone 
 Stuck at the crib with no food or a phone 
 What you thinkin' your girl gon' be on 
 Party at jam's house people would come 
 Sippin that scissor, hitten them blunts 
 Underage kids could come and get drunk 
 Did I hit it? well maybe just once 
 She had a boyfriend they was in love 
 He had a job he was sellin the... uh 
 Same shit's on the streets 
 Now she gettin' two letters a week sayin' 
 What is the lonlest number that your'll ever do? 
 When your looking for love, 
 And daddy ain't there to hug 
 And two is the lonlest number is as bad as one, when your hurtin' your soul 
 Thinking your makin' a feelin' at home 
 But these are the thing we all go through 
 Its everyday life for me and you 
 Don't feel bad 
 I know you feel bad 
 I know you feel bad 
 Things that happen eveyday 
 Around the world or around your way 
 Just tell a story 
 What do we do? 
 Tell a story 
 This is starting to get old 
 Got me feelin' lyk a whales in fish bowl 
 When the city and the summer can get cold 
 When the army your home is gnna get stole 
 N everybody and your moma got bad credit 
 It don't matter we ball like we athletic 
 On the run from the cops 
 Till we asmatic 
 In a house will a bill...? 
 This ain't nothin' but life for ghetto youghts 
 That I'm writing spitting this little booth 
 N if I lie I still mix it with little truth 
 When I go down nigga I'm living proof 
 Don't get mad because I'm stuck in this glory 
 N y'all rappers ain't go nothing to for me 
 But right now I guess the storys over 
 The storys over 
 Ryhmefest 
 A leader of records man

 Put it down

 We get on borey
