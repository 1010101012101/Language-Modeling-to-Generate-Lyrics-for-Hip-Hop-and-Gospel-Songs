(Some of these days) 
 I wanna bust some heads 
 (Some of these days) 
 I'd rather lie inda bed 
 (Some of these days) 
 I'm out tryna get love 
 (Some of these days) 
 I'm just up in the strip club 
 (Some of these days) 
 I feel like crying 
 (Some of these days) 
 I feel like dying 
 (Some of these days) 
 MAA-N! 
 (Some of these days) 
 Woo, thank you very much now 
 I wanna spaz out 
 Throw a brick through a sucker ass nigga glasshouse - wit cho' 
 I know the time comin' 
 Child support gonna bust in and try to find something - but no! 
 My baby momma just don't understand, 
 I ain't rich bitch it's just an advance - but she know 
 She better off wit some of these nigs 
 Whose baby dads don't even care for these kids 
 I don't kick it wit cowards, this my career you just rap in the shower 
 You ain't stackin on power, he ain't...?? 
 You ain't ready to ride, get yo' ass out that impala... Holla! 
 I'm on my grind, be back in an hour. 
 I'm like a bully up in the class, whose waitin for a chance to whopp yo ass, but then again, 
 I used to get cheese, kids said they actin' white...???? but then again 
 Ain't no benefit, 'fest can't not lose 'cause he get ignorant 
 I ain't innocent, Jesus walked me to the grammies 
 Thank you god, now I can sin again 
 I feel like puff daddy, 'cause I ain't vote and I ain't die 
 I ain't a hypocrite, I don't hate rap music, I just love my shit 
 Kanye, common and twista, that's it 
 But then again, I kinda like eminem, he be funny and dissin 
 I bought his record, it's a one time listen 
 But man, some of these days I'm mo' black and I be ready to blast 
 Till I see a white girl with a black girl ass 
 I wanna take that white girl give her a black girl mask 
 But if I get a dark Italian girl, it just might paaaass. 
 I wish I wasn't good at rhyming, 'cause then my dumbass would go dining 
 But until that time arrive I won't play thug 
 Just say hey this is tough love
