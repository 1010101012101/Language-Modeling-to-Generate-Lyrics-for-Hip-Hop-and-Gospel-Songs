Hey 
 It's time to live it up, oh 
 You get sent the fine wine deliverables and chocolate candles 
 It's time to live it up, oh 
 Horse and carrots, ride round the riddler and rock chinchillas 
 Girl I ain't going nowhere, sit here and play cops and robbers down by the moonlight 
 Sunrise it's time to go, grab your phone take some pictures 
 Love in modern time 
 If we just go for a ride 
 Speed of light ignoring the signs 
 I'll race you to St. Harvest Way 
 It's time to live it up, oh 
 You get sent the fine wine deliverables and chocolate candles 
 Its time to live it up, oh 
 Matching shiny shoes dressed like Thriller and watch Godzilla 
 It's a lovely Sunday, sit here and crack a big ole lobster, shrimp and pasta 
 I seen your face when I call, grab you phone change your status 
 Love in modern time 
 Hey

 Speed of light ignoring the signs 
 (Speed of light) 
 I'll race you to St. Harvest Way 
 (Oh, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon... c'mon, mon) 
 Diamonds what were sending in time 
 (Diamonds what were sending in time) 
 Illusions they can fall through the mind 
 (Fall through your mind) 
 Hey lookout go the other way 
 (Hey c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon) 
 Hey 
 It's time to live it up, oh 
 All right I want to introduce you to Mr. London 
 Take the night out I've been wondering 
 Hit the coast, and cruise the beach 
 Cop the flavor, taste like peach 
 Conversations go your way, talk to me take it to the U.K 
 T.N.T. consider the topic it's the function for why I'm in the Tropics 
 C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon 
 Hey 
 (Not one place, not one time) 
 If we just go for a ride

 Speed of light ignoring the signs 
 (Speed of light) 
 I'll race you to St. Harvest Way 
 (C'mon, c'mon, c'mon) 
 Hey
