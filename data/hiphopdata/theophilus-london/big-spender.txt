Good lookin', so refined 
 Say wouldn't you like to know what's going on in my mind? 
 So let me get right to the point 
 I don't pop my cork for every guy I see 
 Hey Big Spender 
 Spend, a little time with me 
 (Verse 1: Theophilus London) 
 This here is Givenchy, 900 dollar jeans homie 
 All these girls be raunchy, like let me see your peen homie 
 She tryna cause a scene, but I'm in Paris with my team 
 Walking slow like I'm on lean, damn a nigga jewelry look so clean 
 I occasionally ball in Lanvin, I ain't talking 'bout Jim Jones 
 Nigga, I'm talking 'bout hooping up, expensive shirt, breaking bones 
 Fuck yo Rolex, roll up homie, roll that kush, blow that homie 
 Oh stop that, the po-po on me, uh, shit out the window 
 We just getting saucy in Aussie, we bossy 
 Tryna bring back the term bling bling 'cause we flossy 
 You brought snapbacks back, well that's a cool accomplishment 
 I'm on the other side, on another globe in a conference 
 Good lookin', so refined 
 Say wouldn't you like to know what's going on in my mind? 
 So let me get right to the point 
 I don't pop my cork for every guy I see 
 Hey Big Spender 
 Spend, a little time with me 
 (Verse 2: A$AP Rocky) 
 Fuck that shit I'm too throwed, pretty nigga my jewels gold 
 Pinky ring and my tooth gold, your main bitch is my new ho 
 Boss nigga like Hugo, Rolex or the Hublot 
 Niggas taking my Screw flow, they tryna jack it like new clothes 
 Purple drank make me move slow, same shit, different day 
 Spanish bitch, she sniffing yay, she say (Yuuup!) that Trigga Trey 
 Like hit that strip, I'm flipping yay, like fuck that shit, I'm getting paid 
 I fuck that bitch, I'm getting laid, I hope that bitch go different ways 
 I get 'em wild, I'm gettin' by, tell 'em roll that shit, I'm getting high 
 I'm tipping low, I'm sitting high, this young Harlem motherfucker getting fly 
 Purple lean, purple weed, got that shit, nigga what you need? 
 Me and Theo had a trio with these bitches from Belize 
 Good lookin', so refined 
 Say wouldn't you like to know what's going on in my mind? 
 So let me get right to the point 
 I don't pop my cork for every guy I see 
 Hey Big Spender 
 Spend, a little time with me 
 (Verse 3: Theophilus London) 
 Fuck that 
 Home boy, I'm never home, I'm not even in my continent 
 In a town, I can't pronounce this shit, this is more than confidence 
 Fuck your continental breakfast, you incompetent 
 My nickname International, my accent changed by accident 
 It's Soho House put your phone away, I don't give a fuck who ya protege 
 I'm from Brooklyn, I fuck with Jay, time to time, I chill with 'Ye 
 Fans don't mosh, nigga they pause, bitches so fly like "Oh, my gosh" 
 Yeah, we selling out girls, girls, money yelling out 
 They planking 'cause they bored, nigga need a new hobby, need a new body 
 You the biter, you the new hottie, you a stylist, wait in my lobby 
 Nigga dance like Bobby, tryna get like 2 cribs for my mommy 
 That ain't guap, bitch that's wasabi, tell Rich I'm the face of Tommy
