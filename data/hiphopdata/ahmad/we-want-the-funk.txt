If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk 
 If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk 
 If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk 
 (We want the funk) 
 If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk 
 (We want the funk) 
 If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk 
 (We want the funk) 
 If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk 
 (We want the funk) 
 Dig it, the mic is mine 
 I'm the incredible man with the gift of gab 
 And when I speak you'll be doin' the freak 
 So if you don't want the funk then you a punk 
 Everybody out of they chairs should go for theirs 
 And if you can find anyone better or as bad as mine 
 That's thick as a dreadlocks and rocks like Lenny Kravitz 
 Then you done great, you done good 
 Wait, I hope they told you I'll explode to any track 
 I'm back on top, ready to drop bombs 
 I'm the only rapper that can rap like this, then do the twist 
 So hold up, wait a minute 
 Let's put the boom back in it to show the Joneses can win it 
 And that's my crew, that's my clan, that's my posse 
 The niggaz with the funky tunes, turn up the volume 
 All you ballers with your '64 Impalas 
 And bass comin' out of your trunk, you better holla if you want the funk 
 If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk 
 (We want the funk) 
 If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk 
 (We want the funk) 
 If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk 
 (We want the funk) 
 If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk 
 (We want the funk) 
 Word now everybody get up then sit back down and yell 
 (Ho) 
 The nigga rolls back with a verse and it gets worse 
 By worse I mean, better than you and I can do 
 Cruise and never lose in fights 
 Because I write and flip scripts 
 I rip up punks and do a cheer, think I'd ring the funk bell, yell 
 (Party over here) 
 Now peep what I brought and maybe I even got 
 A million funk styles for ya, baby 
 In stacks, so when I rap the claps come 
 Through I'm new but been hearin' cheers for years 
 And fear is a mind state, I rip up raps and do up dance stuff 
 The great Ahmad, if you agree then nod 
 Your head like this or like that I can rap with anyone 
 And still won't fall, I do it all so y'all kids with tapes on your shelves 
 And twelves boomin' out of your trunk 
 You better yell if you want the funk 
 If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk 
 (We want the funk) 
 If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk 
 (We want the funk) 
 If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk 
 (We want the funk) 
 If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk

 If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk 
 (We want the funk) 
 Well, I'm still kickin' the funk, don't believe it, you don't have to 
 But bet a buck, you gon' believe it when I leave it stuck 
 Imprinted through a rhyme I invented 
 To indent your skull 'cause I got soul 
 Everybody get ready then set go 
 And when I let go of the microphone get your jam on 
 But one more thing before I sing 'cause I'm fat and ask for you 
 Please get off your rump and scream if you want the funk 
 If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk 
 (We want the funk) 
 If you didn't come to dance then you don't want the funk 
 (We want the funk)

 Party over here, bust you over there)
