Dig it, if you got the feeling, then jump and rip the roof up 
 Steady flowin rhymes, drop 'Heavy' like that 'Blue Funk' 
 Niggaroe, Westcoast kid, with the new sound 
 Never fake, I be real, so what you gonna do now? 
 Battle? I don't think so, look, I got your noose tugged 
 Did ya, now standin there, daisy with your dukes up 
 Who's up next to watch me get loose, then bruise necks 
 And niggas who stink 
 Then go hang out like a link 
 I'm the brink of the blow up 
 Sink and watch me go up 
 Another level, let the bass boom 
 As the treble tunes up 
 My too rough style 
 I'm too tough 
 I'm gifted, ovin the crowd 
 I make 'em get up, then I get down 
 It's the sound of the new kid gettin' stupid 
 I know shit stinks, so I don't mind if you loop it 
 Oops, almost went pop, now drama like that deserves a Grammy 
 It's the (bonafied funk for your fanny)
