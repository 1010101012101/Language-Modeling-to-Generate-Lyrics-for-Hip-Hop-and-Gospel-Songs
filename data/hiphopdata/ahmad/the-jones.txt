Don't let the jones' get you down 
 (Get you down) 
 (Don't let the jone's get you down) 
 Thinkin' well it's the niggaroe back with my crew 
 Now what you wanna do 
 The jones', we on this, mic 
 So we'll fight to the finish 
 But I don't need spinach for me to do this 
 Pride in givin' niggas pop-eyes, I'm large as buddhist 
 Rappers wanna be down, 'cause they think that I'm better than 
 They, but I'll be ok-solo like the letterman 
 Use my common sense to boom-shalaklak-boom 
 Then lock the room, get busy as I get busy 
 Sayin' "don't let the jones' get you..." 
 But I'll hit you where it hurts, made you relapse in curves 
 When I throw verbs and nouns, any sound that I spit up 
 I have battle rappers usin' they clappers because they don't wanna get up 
 They all wanna be like me, and so they re-write 
 Them wack-ass raps that they make and try to fake 
 So I break bones and holler "jones' forever" 
 Cleverest shit around 
 But don't ever let us get you down 
 Well, everybody says, "'mad, what are the jones'? " 
 Well, let's see, it's a posse, true, and it's a crew 
 But not really, so what I'm gonna do 
 Is combine 'em all and find a title that'll fit 
 We're a group of money makers from the west that be runnin' shit 
 Fly like a discus, don't miss this, 'cause it's me, and 
 I win fights with more mic energy than a pre-amp 
 They listen to ahmad and the jones' in here rock 
 And roll with soul, then wanna copy like a xerox 
 'Cause I mic-check and never once sound like das at all 
 >From a superman crew, so I do the impossible 
 Droppin' y'all wack crews like missiles, then I whistle 
 Kendal'll bring the 808 until the party say, "the great 
 'Mad is the king of the ring," because I bring 
 Funk that shakes the ground 
 But don't ever let us get you down 
 (And everybody wanna be like us 
 I think it's 'cause we on this mic 
 We're the jones', so) 
 Don't let the jones' get you down 
 Kick it, I'm back, never can lose, I'm the man when I wanna 
 Might gruff on rappers get ran like jackie joyner 
 The jones' everybody wanna be us, they be jockin 
 'Cause we rockin' the boat and in control like a remote 
 So I pack a 38-page rap book, put your gun away 
 And yell 'truce!' before I have to get loose and run away 
 With the title I've already won, don't mean to brag 
 Kendal blew up like a rocket, and I get down like a sag 
 I nag rappers that don't follow my lead, and if they need 
 Assistance they get dragged the distance in a bag 
 The jones' for life, throw up a j if they ever say 
 Who's runnin' this town 
 But don't ever let us get you down 
 Don't let the jones' get you down
