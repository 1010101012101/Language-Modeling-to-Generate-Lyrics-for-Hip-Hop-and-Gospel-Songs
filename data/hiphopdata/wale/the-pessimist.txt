Oh so there's still hope? 
 I don't want hope, hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. 
 When you're hopeless you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference, it makes you attractive 
 A nigga feelin' hopeless 
 Who am I to change perception? 
 If a nigga kill a nigga he's another statistic 
 If his skin's a little different they gon' say it was self defense 
 Nigga feelin' hopeless 
 Starin' at the idiom box, riddle me this 
 If a killer was a nigga would niggas still really care 
 'Cause niggas worser than Zimmerman livin' life everywhere 
 Niggas hopeless 
 Small niggas with big tools 
 Couldn't get to Harvard, hard work, he hard whipped 
 'Cause them hardy hah's and hard nights 
 Are hard to live through 
 When you hopeless 
 What we gotta do to be winnin'? 
 'Cause all the schools gettin' closed 
 Dribble a little, coach, shootin' at a foe 
 'Cause they chargin' them to hoop at community center 
 My nigga, hopeless 
 25 bands, he was shootin' not a damn givin' 
 Cousin threw a couple grand at some dancers 
 Throwin' back their fat ass, is my glasses confused? 
 We're the hopeless 
 America's dream and nightmare in the same being 
 Even when being polite here 
 Niggas try to bring me down, the life of a pioneer 
 Lightyears worth of hopeless 
 Celebrities celebratin' disgust me 
 The cerebellum invaded with all these fresh things on 
 Watchin' "Love and Hip Hop: Atlanta" as we speak 
 Nigga we hopeless 
 Okay, the Steebie show is on 
 And so my broad rollin' weed now she's mad at me 
 'Cause she seen a scene with Rasheeda baby father 
 Said, "You niggas all hopeless" 
 Got a pocket full of lint again, but it make no difference to me 
 Fallin' out with my friends again, but it make no difference to me 
 Goddamn I'm hopeless 
 Oh man I'm hopeless 
 Got no gas in my tank again, but it make no difference to me 
 Overdraft at the bank again, but it make no difference to me 
 Goddamn I'm hopeless 
 Lord knows I'm hopeless 
 Still I pray 
 Nigga feelin' hopeless 
 Like a Penny with a hole in it 
 We as empty as a coraz√≥n of a widow 
 From a soul that she don't know when he's comin' home 
 He don't got no limit, hopeless 
 What's a purple heart to a hurt head? 
 He done done 12 years, he was told 6 
 Prolly go back in a minute, ain't shit here 
 Nigga so hopeless 
 Thoughts are ravaging in the whole crib 
 Now he post-traumatic and always on the edge 
 On the pills, some bills, two kids, one leg 
 Nigga so hopeless 
 A lot of black cops always clap back 
 And some foul white cops always on deck 
 Playin' race card, guarantee you'll make a blackjack 
 Nigga so hopeless 
 'Cause we ain't 'posed to ever have shit 
 And we ain't vocal as rap 
 Niggas 'cause we don't mope unless we trap hits 
 Nigga hopeless 
 Look at what I go through to show you 
 Niggas respect money, money respect power 
 And power, we never given unless 
 A nigga catch, shoot or dribble 
 We are hopeless 
 Nah you ain't out here for the culture 
 You finna riot, without a purpose 
 You ain't a mothafuckin' rider, you a fuckin' token, posin' 
 Nigga hopeless 
 Of course not literal 
 But why complain about the man 
 When a nigga with my skin 
 The same problems with them I had 
 Is out there killin' niggas too? 
 Eat your food, nigga 
 Got a pocket full of lint again, but it make no difference to me 
 Fallin' out with my friends again, but it make no difference to me 
 Goddamn I'm hopeless 
 Oh man I'm hopeless 
 Got no gas in my tank again, but it make no difference to me 
 Overdraft at the bank again, but it make no difference to me 
 Goddamn I'm hopeless 
 Lord knows I'm hopeless 
 Still I pray
