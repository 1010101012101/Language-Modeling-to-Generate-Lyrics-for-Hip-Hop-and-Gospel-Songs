 Get out of my head, get into my bed 
 Come to me now, I'm tired of dreaming; imagine, baby 
 Ooh, get out of my head, get into my bed 
 Come to me now, I'm tired of dreaming; imagine, baby 
 Fame has made me more foolish, uh 
 What would you do with all these lusty groupies? Uh 
 And I know that God has made me only human, uh 
 But I'd like to take the time to describe to y'all my favorite woman 
 Look... teeth, white and bright and still talk to me like we back home 
 And the weed? That's optional cause my only concern's that her head's strong 
 And her feet? Let's see; course you know I like them clean 
 And I can understand a little bruise, you've been running through a nigga's mind all damn week 
 And no, I won't OD, you'll get D, young as 19 
 I believe age is for math, all I need is chemistry, yeah 
 The shawty be the glory - until my dream real 
 And I like a good story, I bet she got a mean tail 
 Your little attitude, and the way you make your moves 
 Baby, it's just hella cute, baby... 
 Girl, I've been lookin' for you cause of the things we do 
 In my dreams, how I be makin' you scream; I wake up like... 
 Get out of my head, get into my bed 
 Come to me now, I'm tired of dreaming; imagine, baby 
 Ooh, get out of my head, get into my bed 
 Come to me now, I'm tired of dreaming; imagine, baby 
 HUH! (Maybach Music) 
 When I look in your soul, all I see is the gold 
 Her beauty is blinding, she's in total control 
 Her emotions at peace, let's walk the shoreline 
 Statuesque as can be, we're spending more time 
 Sky-dweller moving counter-clockwise 
 A perfect 10, I'm watching you through God's eyes 
 Bonita Applebaum - my strawberry letter 
 Love Potion #9, this shit's a gifted era 
 If this is wrong, you my co-defendant 
 As we plead guilty to this life sentence 
 Choosy lovers - she my block goddess 
 I love the realist - rock solid 
 Your little attitude, and the way you make your moves 
 Baby, it's just hella cute, baby... 
 Girl, I've been lookin' for you cause of the things we do 
 In my dreams, how I be makin' you scream; I wake up like... 
 Get out of my head, get into my bed 
 Come to me now, I'm tired of dreaming; imagine, baby 
 Ooh, get out of my head, get into my bed 
 Come to me now, I'm tired of dreaming; imagine, baby
