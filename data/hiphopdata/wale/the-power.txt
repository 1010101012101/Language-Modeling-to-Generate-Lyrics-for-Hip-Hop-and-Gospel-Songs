I told ya! 
 WHAT?! 
 I told ya she liked... 
 How do you know?! 
 She told me. She said she's never had a man 
 Stir up all these feelings inside of her 
 She's questioning her faith! 
 She's thinking of leaving the church! 
 WOW! 
 Rrrgh!..boy... this is power! 
 Avery Storm: 
 I got two whole tears in a bucket 
 And if my plans fall through then fuck it. Naaaaw 
 Way to much right here is at stake. 
 I am invincible! 
 I am unstoppable! 
 Wale: 
 Straight renegade, penetrating minds 
 Taking my time, let me levitate 
 Y'all can't ever fade that 
 I don't ever lack shit 
 I ain't ever ask for nothin' to make it right here. 
 Y'all all passe, stuck up on last year 
 I'm everybody top ten, you ain't even top tier 
 My criteria ain't even that serious 
 The way a nigga see it you lil niggas is ________ 
 Yeah, I got felipe ____ flow 
 See I slept now atleast y'all know 
 I live by the code, fuck bitches, love queen so 
 You don't gotta wonder what I got up on my team 
 Got a pocket full of cream, my moccasin's clean 
 I'm playin' for the green shawty ima team pleaser 
 Ima team player, I ain't tryna be no king 
 Just tryna be a legend for a nigga hit 3... 
 0, the board CEO 
 I'm glad you all witnessing what I did for D.C. tho 
 They disregard me, I guess they all got egos 
 They all need attention, they call me and ____ 
 The Roq to a ____, they all believe me tho 
 And even with that, I be the rap Don Cheadle 
 Its hotel Rwanda, boast got 'cause I got-ta 
 Spit that raw shit, y'all some talkative condoms 
 (Fall back)

 Wale: 
 Who woulda thought that the little running back 
 With the dickerson mask 
 Would be getting in the ass of opponents 
 Witness what I'm showing 
 And I don't need no center or guard, to get him open 
 (Hold up) I used to run powers and draws 
 Now I'm trickin with the strippers, the power of the draws 
 And I don't run counters no more 
 But I took a fly route to an opposite shore
