Ladies and Gentlemen 
 I ain't trynna be politically correct 
 But I won't rest till I'm givin' my respect 
 And my vision isn't set on the money I get 
 But more less the vest I'm comin' for y'all neck 
 I ain't jelous, though vexed 
 Just feelin' how you felt when you came, 
 More or less the change is imminent 
 I ask Mr. West for a lil bit of hope realize us new niggas gotta get it ourself 
 So I dreamed of presentin myself and the only thing I fear is I being shelved 
 The cocky, liveliest for nobody, book so many bitches shoulda been the cum laude 
 Fuck the comradery with B rate artists 
 I'm ballin you niggas is Arliss so watch this 
 Always knew where the pot was 
 With no receivers had the pickin' of a option 
 Tommie Frazier on the mu'fuckin' one or two's 
 Or Michael Vick if y'all bark nigga y'all through 
 Yeah, 25, 25, 25 can I get 30 my side jones is fat and my freak jones is purdy 
 Why? 'Cause I Mac like Bernie and she swallow everything like Kirby 
 Not Puckett but I hit it then I duck a bitch 
 And older women put a nigga on their Bucket list 
 Me against you the movie of the year 
 Cause you slum dawg and I'm the millionaire 
 Their buzz internet and mines in her net 
 Should know I'm winnin' that Chanel fitted cap 
 I know they suck I'm just showin you where my city at 
 Where fiends always on that water like a lily pad 
 But since Mark put a nigga on that lily track 
 I had the British shows talkin' bout bring him back 
 But that's a shitty accent you should've figured that 
 'Cause I been drinkin' till the point that I'm a dizzy rap 
 Scab, fix up look shop joe 
 'Cause I'mma look that part until I'm all broke, yeah
