(Intro: Wale) 
 The streets is cold and the beaches is warm 
 The bitches is everything in between... 
 (Verse 1: Wale) 
 Who would believe this rap shit would have me well off 
 Type of life a nigga kill or go to jail for 
 Yeah, can't wait till the wheels down 
 And I'm amazed you clown niggas is still around 
 Smoking haze all over town like it's allowed 
 I like my women soft-spoken but the weed loud 
 Catching Heat floor seats and we all fresh 
 From coarse seats to court seats is progress, of course 
 Tell them other niggas "man up" 
 Tell Lebron drop 50 unless he playin' us 
 KOD a couple 50s like a precinct 
 Straight conch got a nigga feeling seasick: oh shit 
 Chef creole, 2-seater 
 And my watch looking like it's all 3PO 
 2 V's in the street blowing trees with hoes 
 And more weed for me, shout out to Me-PO 
 (Hook: Wale) 
 Miami nights, it was all a dream 
 If I can get my money right, I'm about to OD 
 Little more weed, 1st class seats 
 1st class hoes, we on South Beach 
 Miami nights, it was all a dream 
 If I can get my money right, I'm about to OD 
 Drinks out, c'mon, Drinks out, c'mon. Drinks out, c'mon 
 (Verse 2: Wale) 
 We at mansion, but no cape on 
 And that ass looking right, what you pay for it? 
 Look: I know you not gay or nothing 
 But we should find another girl with a tapeworm 
 I'm in a rental on collins 
 Me and my compadres, burning up Barneys 
 With a model and some [?] 
 My name hold weight and you don't really keep the bar raised 
 With dark niggas with dark thoughts and long braids 
 It's not far from white girls with big bread 
 And light beers, they slight care, they spring breaking 
 But right there, they skill scheming, they not eating 
 Knowing they needy as a bitch, they don't need a reason 
 And when you repping Wet Willies you ain't even thinking 
 (Verse 3: Wale) 
 Ok black panamera, dash on a million 
 It ain't nothing better than a passionate woman 
 She graduated top of the class, Carol City or was it the west 
 Hold up I don't remember really, hold up 
 2 whips, 6 tattoos, no kids 
 And I heard you come alive, when you gonna live [?] 
 I ain't trying to be ignorant, but I'm leaving town in a little bit 
 Miami nights, ain't another one, until the buzz go away lets have a little fun 
 Paradise, get away, thinking why it's not South Beach everyday 
 (Outro: Rozay) 
 We got the jet waiting on us at the airport homie 
 We got money to go get baby 
 Let's get it
