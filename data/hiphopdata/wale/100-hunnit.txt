(Wale) 
 I promised Ricky and Milly that I'ma kill it 
 Running throughout them digits, and Dollars on me I'm on it 
 I'm running I'm so 100 with every nigga I run with 
 Tell them niggas we coming, we f-cking it up this summer 
 (Meek Mill) 
 And I'm stunting like it ain't nothing, most of these niggas fronting 
 I pull this Rolly from Travi, and I got this Beamer from nothing 
 If they ain't talking bout paper, just tell them end of discussion 
 And now that I'm getting money, my neighbors turn to my cousins 
 (Wale) 
 Gold bottles, lot of bitches 
 Didn't think I'm sorry I'm such a shallow nigga 
 The mind on me just shine on them, you shadow women 
 Went out with rats you niggas should be in glass slippers 
 (Meek Mill) 
 Ha, and I don't ever ask the price on it 
 Married to the money hater, throw some rice on it 
 I told my jeweler get my Mueller, throw some mimes on it 
 I treat that p-ssy like its Tina, I go Ike on it 
 Beat it up, I'm getting heated up 
 When I say I'm high, I ain't talking weed it up 
 (Wale) 
 Bitch I'm talking G5, Titobero ?, ? out 
 Beaters on my sneakers, even though I never be with Dex 
 B and me, train hi up 
 (Meek Mill) 
 He lying I'm on papers 
 But when I knock this shit off, ima go and buy some Lakers 
 Yeah I'm talking bout that Cali kush, We can work in? 
 Two bad bitches in the back, they prettier than ratty look 
 (Wale) 
 Bitch I'm hot as Wasabi in Abu Dhabi 
 In a sauna with some models, we treat them like? 
 I ain't thugging, I ain't robbing, I'm puffing on my broccoli 
 Doing 100 in a bucket, be like 20 in a 'rari 
 (Meek Mill) 
 And I'm back on this shit again, Pressie blue like Michigan 
 I put on for my city I should ball with Vick and them 
 When I get my D12 I'ma be a Sixer then 
 Riding round with Looney and your sister and your sister's friend 
 (Wale) 
 Hold up 
 Got the fridgedest temperature on my wrist again 
 Trying to shit the niggas is like giving children ritalin 
 ? Sitting in the front, see you in a minute yo 
 And them haters went away as soon as I left Interscope 
 (Meek Mill) 
 Big money, I'm talking bad hoes 
 You niggas full of shit, f-cking assholes 
 I'm in this presidential suite, I'm in my bathrobe 
 Counting 100 grand I put it from my last show 
 Shitting on them, something I ain't mean to do 
 These hoes do anything, our wish is like a genie do 
 A nigga by a point, here take the nina too 
 I get a chick to come and serve you like Serena do 
 (Wale) 
 I think its genius when Lena do you in a group 
 Stunting, I'm in the sixth, I call that shit middle school 
 High as shit, I'm in a booth 
 Never nag them, ima choose 
 And I don't gotta front, I play these niggas like I wish 'em to 
 This is where the Wizards play, this is where them bitches play 
 Weed a have you falling, and now you scraping up that ? shape 
 The day a hater treat a nigga like he fake, 
 Tthat be the day his label treat him like a signal fade 
 (Meek Mill) 
 And I'm balling bitch, I'm balling bitch 
 Me Wale, so hard, this shit 
 Get your budget money back, fire all your artists-ess 
 We be burning everything, they label us as arsonists 
 If ain't in the middle of the track, in 106 and Park in it
