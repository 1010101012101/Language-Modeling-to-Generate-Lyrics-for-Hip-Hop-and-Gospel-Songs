Come fly with me, yeah 
 You're the one I been waitin' for 
 This is all I got, girl, I saved it all for you 
 Usin' real emotions you can't ignore 
 That you've been lovin' all night 
 Yeah, pour some Patron, have a cup with me 
 Come by the crib, keep me company 
 Don't worry 'bout bitches who buggin' me 
 Girl, if you fuck with me, just come and fuck with me (goddamn) 
 I can put it on you, I just need me a change 
 Goddamn, must got mirrors on you, I see me in the plans 
 Fuck the club, girl, I've been ready to go 
 Got the Uber waitin', we can head to the door 
 Yeah, Four Seasons or a room at The Ritz 
 I'ma show you this is as real as it gets 
 Take me out the game, you might even do it (Yeah, we gon' see, right) 
 Christian Louboutin, Jimmy Choo and Louis 
 It's on me 
 You'd be my heaven on Earth 
 My love, my forever, my first 
 I know you're not perfect, but girl, you're still worth it 
 I swear you're my gift and my curse, oh 
 You'd be my heaven on Earth (my heaven on Earth) 
 My love, my forever, my first, oh 
 I know you're not perfect, but girl, you're still worth it 
 I swear you're my gift and my curse (yeah, gift and my curse) 
 Fly with me 
 If heaven had a height, she would be that tall (mmm) 
 Exceed that far, you see my scars (mmm) 
 I see your flaws, I see no problem 
 I know we're not gods, so we all got 'em 
 She a introvert, still good in public 
 I'm not a socialite, so sure she love it 
 I would tell you more, no lyin' or nothin' 
 Maybe I like to pick fight just to write about 'em 
 Maybe you right, you a good muse 
 Lemme right a couple wrongs, couple hooks, boo 
 No Postmates, aye, 'cause that gon' make me wait 
 I just go below your waist for the good food 
 With me, yeah 
 And with you I'm tryna be, with 
 So I'm at your door again 
 And it's just past 4 AM 
 And I hope you phone ain't ringin' (haha) 
 So when love's in your reach 
 To whole share a key (Wale) 
 And the moon is in the sky 
 And it's cool 'cause she can fly 
 So pull up on me, pull up on me 
 And keep doin' your thing 
 You'd be my heaven on Earth 
 My love, my forever, my first 
 I know you're not perfect, but girl, you're still worth it 
 I swear you're my gift and my curse, oh 
 You'd be my heaven on Earth (my heaven on Earth) 
 My love, my forever, my first, oh 
 I know you're not perfect, but girl, you're still worth it 
 I swear you're my gift and my curse (gift and my curse) 
 You'd be my heaven on Earth 
 My love, my forever, my first, oh 
 You'd be my heaven on Earth 
 I swear you're my gift and my curse
