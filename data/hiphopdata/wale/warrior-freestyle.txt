Wale in the buildin' 
 D.C. in the buildin' 
 My name Wale Folarin, larin 
 And I came here to party, party 
 You not built for no drama, drama 
 They just tough when they talkin 
 Chill 
 And I will not stop 
 Wale Folarin I am hip-hop 
 I spit hot, this shit so pop 
 Burn my wirstwatch like the top of a cop 
 Car, but I don't run with the fuzz, don't run I fly 
 Drugs in my lungs, pounds in my jeans 
 BBC on T.V. BBC 
 Streets on fire I need to leave 
 I'm Stayin Alive, I'm so Bee Gees 
 Wyclef Gene, Jean 
 Please my product calls for no squash 
 Bathin' Ape a bitch or King Kong 
 Come to my place and take the things off 
 You will jump off I need to jump off 
 Hop in my car and we can play ball 
 We be on green like weed and playin golf 
 Bitch Kick game like I play football 
 Got so many hoes you thought I'm Julard 
 Symtex says they know who I are 
 So I made songs for ya'll, ya'll, and ya'll 
 Icy shock, no other more 
 Haters in the way can't stop my hit 
 If you want mercy than stop the diss 
 I'm the shit I ain't ever letting up 
 Symtex said they ain't better than us 
 So that's what's up, and that's what's dope 
 The ultimate warrior shaking on ropes 
 HA!
