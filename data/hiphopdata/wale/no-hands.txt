 Then I'ma throw this money, w hile you do it with no hands 
 Girl drop it to the flo' I love the way your booty go 
 All I want to do is sit back, and watch you move as I proceed to throw this cash 
 (Waka Verse)

 Long hair she don't care, when she walk she get stares 
 Brown skin or a yellow-bone DJ this my favorite song

 She said look ma no hands, she said look ma no hands 
 And no darlin' I don't dance and I'm with Roscoe I'm with Waka I think I deserve a chance 
 I'm a bad muhfucka, go ask some muthafuckas, a young handsome muthafucka, I sling that wood I just nunchunk 'em

 Them niggas tippin good girl, but I can make it flush, 'cause I walk around with pockets that are bigger than my bus 
 Rain rain go away that's what all my haters say, my pockets stuck on overload, my rain never evaporates. 
 No need to elaborate, most of these ducks exaggerate 
 But imma get money nigga, everyday stuntin nigga, ducks might get a chance after me
