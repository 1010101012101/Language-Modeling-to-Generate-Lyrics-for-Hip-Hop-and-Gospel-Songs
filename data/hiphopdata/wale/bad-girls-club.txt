She's a star if I ever seen one 
 Perfect 10 and Lord knows that I need one 
 So now I'm under pressure I want it bad 
 She got something I never had, I see ya looking at me 
 Bad bitches get low 
 Bad bitches get low right now 
 Bad bitches get low 
 Bad bitches get low right now 
 Wale and we are not the same 
 Got bread in the diesel, got diesel in the check 
 Rock steady, me and my nigga, Cole 
 Leave me a couple minutes, you leave me a couple hoes 
 Quite gifted, ambitions of life living 
 Despite living with more attention than light skinned women 
 Okay, you think a nigga shallow? 
 Okay, you probably think I get 'em all with the cash flow 
 Actually I like a broad that can bag hoes 
 That's how I rope 'em all down, see my last hoe 
 (Work) 
 Blast off 
 (Work) 
 Get involved 
 Gas women then return 'em like a rental car 
 That's one show, that's fifty large 
 Nigga, I just glow bright as any DeBarge 
 I'm just tryin' to get ya comfortable 
 And it's amazing what some liquor and a blunt'll do 
 She's a star if I ever seen one 
 Perfect 10 and Lord knows that I need one 
 So now I'm under pressure I want it bad 
 She got something I never had, I see ya looking at me 
 Please show love 
 Make way for the bad girls club 
 Please show love 
 Make way for the bad girls club 
 Hey, Cole World, down for whatever 
 Boy got dollars, pounds or whatever 
 Being broke and it's a Diddy ass world 
 Still found a way to get pretty ass girls 
 Killin' y'all niggas, any last words 
 'Cause you didn't play the game right 
 Hey girl, before you throw it at me 
 You gotta make sure you aim right 
 Red dots 'cause I'm red hot 
 Seen dead, girl, you smoking 
 I get paper like I a mail box, seen 
 But girl you got me open 
 Proceed, pocket full of G's 
 Kush, baby mama less, yeah, no seeds 
 Blow trees like a hurricane 
 Damn, if looks kill then ya murderin' 
 Damn 
 She's a star if I ever seen one 
 Perfect 10 and Lord knows that I need one 
 So now I'm under pressure I want it bad 
 She got something I never had, I see ya looking at me 
 Bad bitches get low 
 Bad bitches get low right now 
 Bad bitches get low 
 Bad bitches get low right now 
 Please show love 
 Make way for the bad girls club 
 Please show love 
 Make way for the bad girls club 
 I am what you want 'cause you like what I make 
 I am what I am and you is who I say 
 Go where you ain't been, no reservation 
 And most hoes be so-so when they hold no makeup 
 Yeah, I got the flow that they know is the truth 
 It's getting ugly in here, guess I coated the booth 
 After the club, gettin' you open 
 And I'm talkin' passenger action 
 I'm pulling you over and you walkin' 
 After the fact, it's knowin' it's over 
 Now tomorrow, you sober wishing you ordered a soda 
 I am more than the dopest 
 I'm forever improving, they can't fuck with ya, boy 
 Like a BYU Cougar, they 22's or something 
 I'm brutal as a bazooka 
 And when the smoke clears don't you dare ask hooka 
 Or who did 'cause I did 
 Bitch, I'm here and I'm it 
 And I'm is what you ain't 
 Who's iller, I'll wait, hold up 
 She's a star if I ever seen one 
 Perfect 10 and Lord knows that I need one 
 So now I'm under pressure I want it bad 
 She got something I never had, I see ya looking at me 
 Bad bitches get low 
 Bad bitches get low right now 
 Bad bitches get low 
 Bad bitches get low right now
