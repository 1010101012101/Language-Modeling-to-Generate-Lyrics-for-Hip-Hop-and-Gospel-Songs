Yeah 
 When I'm gone, the whole city missed me 
 I'm on my UK shit 
 Get me 
 The eye of the Bengal shuffling my Ickey 
 Y'all Boomer, You need you an MD 
 Like Esiason 
 Dominating of the eastside shall commence 
 And I shall commence that I'm the truth yo 
 Yo, they try to block me like Munoz 
 I know my car is worth, like phone card 
 I get brain everyday, I'm a know it all 
 More birds then know it all cool wit y'all 
 Keep talking my know it knows none of y'all 
 Hit the green like running backs with no yards 
 No hoe, I'm playing with the floor 
 Overly Ingracious 
 They call me say word 
 Wiki say word 
 Just so happens mine they prefer 
 Yours is the fur 
 We ahead of the curve 
 And they all look a like, like the girls all virgins 
 Cut beats, I'm a fucking word surgeon 
 Scalpel and sponge 
 This work 
 Dance 
 Under the spotlights 
 Neither black nor white 
 It doesn't matter 
 Do the dance (do the dance) 
 As strong as you might 
 Working day and night 
 What ever happens 
 Do the dance (do the dance) 
 On my way back home 
 Now I'm in the zone 
 My simcards a bomb 
 They blowing up my phone 
 Kicks Hong Kong 
 Bape undergarment 
 The face of hip-hop 
 My DC audience 
 And you niggas will acknowledge this 
 Born again social life thanks climate 
 My climate is way higher then Lindsay Lohan nostrils on powder 
 Sorry Mark, I don't want offend your sister's good friend 
 But when my pen get in 
 It pretends in itself it's an entity 
 And it interferes and gets the best of me 
 So I'm one with that 
 I'm stuck with that 
 Y'all little ass niggas can't fuck with that 
 Nigga, this how it'd sound if a truck could rap 
 Little light in the ass 
 But I muscle rap 
 And I must admit 
 I bring creatine to the scene 
 Your developmental league don't see a team 
 I got a stitch little nigga 
 You can see my seam 
 Spit selvage my nigga, it's in my jeans 
 Kicking Mule, my denim raw 
 Kicks made you look, Nas 
 Riding in the black joint listening to Gnarles Barkley 
 On, DS y'all, DS flow like nothing y'all heard 
 Broke ass niggas all see before 
 Low cash niggas, broke ass niggas 
 I don't fuck with you all hoe ass niggas 
 I be Remy sippin ammo as sippin 
 On my 35-double-O ass niggas 
 Rittenhouse niggas, K-D-Y niggas, Trinidad niggas 
 I got y'all niggas 
 DC pimpin', uptown roamin 
 Moco 124 when I go out 
 PG, Ardmore where my niggas ball at 
 Say what you want Largo with my homie 
 Do this shit for all em 
 Smoking on a Marley 
 Rawer than a marlin 
 Fresh above the water 
 Say I'm not hot 
 Then your prolly on water 
 They prolly on water, they prolly on water 
 Prolly on water, they all on water 
 Acquire more broads then Zachary Morris 
 Y'all all Screech to me 
 You released the beast and I play your little niggas like Lisa, shit 
 Y'all niggas don't worry me a least a bit 
 And a finger in the middle what I leave 'em with 
 I can't hear little niggas and he be's a bitch 
 What the least thing he has that don't know English 
 Fuck it, I'm done 
 Let me breathe hard like it was hard 
 Gone 
 Under the spotlights 
 Neither black nor white 
 It doesn't matter 
 Do the dance (do the dance) 
 As strong as you might 
 Working day and night 
 Whatever happens 
 Do the dance (do the dance)
