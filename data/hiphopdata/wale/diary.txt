If I told you I wanted to talk to you, you know 
 You'd think I'm tryin' to holler at you 
 And maybe I am, but you wouldn't hear me out anyways would you? 
 Rather lose love than to move on never knowin' what it feels like 
 Short days, long nights by the phone, no call 
 Need a clear mind 'cause I been blind got me goin' down that road 
 Heart made of stone 
 Far away from home, 
 Black woman c-c-cold 
 Every problem that you ever had with another man, I gotta face 
 Started off on thin ice I'm still here but I can't skate 
 Slow sink, can't breathe 
 No remorse, don't think 
 Listen to your friend, 
 Get another man for a minute then repeat 
 Queen, 
 You deserve the title 
 But she rejects what I give 
 While she nurse the wounds by them 
 Tried them, didn't work 
 Got impossible standards, 
 Nothin' I do's gonna work 
 Diary of a black girl 
 I wonder why I sit and cry, wish I could shed all these tears 
 I'm down and out, I'll keep on movin' and tryin' to get out 
 I don't know how to move on, where I went wrong 
 Wish I could live with no fears 
 So down and out, I'll keep it movin' and try to get out, somehow 
 Black girl 
 Raise by a momma who, hates the baby father, so 
 She don't have a problem with, sayin' "fuck a nigga" quick 
 I'm just tryin' to be the one who never run, but you run away from me 
 Your girlfriend's men cheat, why not me the same thing 
 She can't see in me, what I see in her 
 This pain she inherit, can't be reversed 
 I can even stay livin' in the shade above the motherfuckers that played ya 
 The irony in that is I ain't even that but you put it in those pages 
 Wife, you deserve the label, 
 But you been hurt before, 
 So you sore, and don't feel you're able 
 Tried them, didn't work 
 Got impossible standards, 
 Nothing that I ever do'll work 
 Diary of a black girl 
 See all I ever want to do is be relevant, 
 Just tell me that I ever meant, 
 Anything or that you could ever see me and you in another light, 
 But it's like the dark winter-endures the darkest nights, 
 By the wrong men, 
 Mostly all of them, 
 Have made you somewhat incapable, 
 Of a first impression, 
 What I do is channel my aggression, 
 With no cable, 
 Or antenna just intentions 
 To impress you, 
 If capable, 
 Hoping that the material possessions can materialize a better you, 
 Cars-nothing I drive 
 Can drive better this frame of mind 
 With such an ugly picture in the end, 
 Money-Nothing I buy 
 Can buy me more time 
 For your ears to say to your heart to listen 
 Diamonds-A girls best friend, 
 Is what they say, 
 But believe me with the right allegiance shorty you gonna shine anyways, 
 And every day that goes by is a couple more lines in her diary, 
 The day before is better than the present, 
 So anyone presented in her presence, 
 Endures her life-sentences- 
 No key for release no reason to be around, 
 Her mind's in the clouds, 
 She writes it all down, 
 In her diary... 
 See all I wanna do is be relevant, 
 Just tell me that I ever meant anything more, 
 That you could ever see me and you in another light, 
 But it's like the dark women indoors in the darkest nights by the wrong man, 
 See all of them have made you incapable of a first impression, 
 What it do is I channel my aggression with no cable or antenna, 
 Just intentions to impress you if capable, 
 Hoping that the material possesions can materialise to a better you, 
 Cars, nothing I drive can drive you out of this state of mind, 
 For such an ugly picture and, 
 Money, nothing I buy can buy more time for your ears to tell your heart to listen to it, 
 Diamonds, a girls best friend is what they say but believe me with the right allegiance shorty you gonna shine anyways, 
 And everyday that goes by is a couple more lines in her diary, 
 The day before is better than the present, 
 So anyone presented in her presence is doing these life sentences, 
 There's no key for release, 
 No reason to be around, 
 Her minds in the clouds, 
 She writes it all down, 
 In her diary,
