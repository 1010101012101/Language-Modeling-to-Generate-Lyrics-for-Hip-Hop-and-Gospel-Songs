Would you believe that? 
 If you believe that 
 TV killed the radio 
 TV killed the radio 
 Let's get it 
 What if they tell you this music was bogus? 
 The government run it, they controlin the culture 
 Would you believe that if you read that? 
 What if they tell you the iPhone was tapped? 
 And see all of your browse and I know you viewin your apps 
 And Twitter and Instagram is really like middle man 
 And internet soldiers, everybody was carrying max 
 And when they said Obama was in a raid 
 He actually got a gut, tan and scratch to pair of black 
 Would you believe that? We reached that, look 
 How bout they tell you you dyin' if you ain't voting? 
 So now you vote for one in reline 
 I got a motion and believe that 
 You know you doin' what you eat 
 What if they make it less? Talkin' you what it do 
 Talkin' you what's here but never let they mother jump 
 Part in the flow with consistence control they many souls 
 I thought it's it, loaded by television shows 
 Opinion show with Muslims see what they lovin' boy 
 A little gossip to you keeps watchin it on point 
 So don't believe so how they are breaking the law? 
 A lot of bullets are prodigal to the gullible 
 I'm turnin' on the radio just to turn the TV on (on, on) 
 I live my whole life in stereo, always singing my old song (song, song) 
 As it flows into my vein 
 As it flows into my vein 
 TV killed the radio 
 TV killed the radio 
 TV killed the radio 
 And then the internet slit the television throat 
 And the world star model fell up out the orbit 
 That's what that brought a rappin' artist behind his mortgage 
 And now the rappers would visit Shawty, Shawty keep goin' 
 And everybody be laughin' at him, he doesn't know it 
 'Cause he believed her, thought he couldn't be G but such a squeaker 
 News flash, news flash, it's a cruel world 
 And no one's too thorough to lose it on to a girl 
 Uh, what if they told you your chip was a boogie 
 You know, like a hoe, the type I've been shootin 
 You gon play it like nah homie, soon as the car pull up 
 Tell er you'll holler at er so get in you gonna lose it 
 TV killed the radio 
 TV killed the radio 
 TV killed the radio 
 And then the internet slit the television throat 
 When I moved forward I gave birth to several episodes 
 Our generation is turned, we got too many clones 
 We just believe they gon repeat what niggas told 
 And all the bullets are prodigal to the gullible 
 I'm turnin' on the radio just to turn the TV on (on, on) 
 I live my whole life in stereo, always singing my old song (song, song) 
 As it flows into my vein 
 As it flows into my vein 
 I'd like to thank all the beautiful people that came out here tonight 
 There's Reese, yeah I see you in the bag baby 
 Oh yeah 
 You hear that? Uh, here to adapt things in the back 
 Young Dallas 
 I feel good right now 
 I just want something bout people but I appreciate 
 I'm to believe it 
 You done
