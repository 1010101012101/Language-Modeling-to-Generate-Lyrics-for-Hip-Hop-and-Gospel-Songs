Wale: 
 Mmm-mirror tell me I'm the realest 
 Since all these other niggas gg-gimmicks ll-lyrics 
 It's all gun bustin', its such a lack of the subject. 
 C-could I be that nigga rejuvinatin l-lovers 
 Ddd-did I stutter the missing piece of the puzzle 
 Feel like the only rapper that look at you with no trouble 
 Its easy on TV make them believe what they be seeing 
 M-mirrors never lie so they keep eyes up on they re-runs 
 For fear of what you show them, reality is golden 
 Real recognize real, you need some IV's to be noticed tho 
 One of the coldest to mix pro-tools with your vocals 
 What the fans can't see that mm-mirror gon notice back 
 Wale: 
 Mirror mirror on the wall, who the realest of them all 
 That ain't hard, swear to God. These niggas ain't real at all 
 Mirror mirror on the wall, Is it right, is it wrong? 
 It ain't hard, swear to God, these niggas ain't real at all

 Bun B: 
 Say there Mr. Mirror, put yourself up to yourself and in 
 Just take a look at the reflection that's reflectin in 
 Your own physical, superficial not spiritual 
 All the possessions you possess, and they can't keep your spirit full 
 You need to hear it fool, but you don't want to listen 'cause 
 You so f-full of your-s-self and you just sit and judge 
 You point 'em out, and call 'em up, and then s-sit 'em down 
 Then you put fertalizer, lyin', spread the shit around 
 But if you took a second Mr. Mirror, you would see 
 That you just mad at you man, you ain't really mad at me 
 You took the hatred of yourself and just projected out 
 No disrespect, you can't respect yourself then just get out 
 For real, you need to go away just like the rain song 
 'Cause you f-frontin and f-fakin its just plain wrong 
 So Mr. Mirror, man I'm just gon keep it G 
 If you can't look up at yourself, 
 How the fuck you lookin' at me, mane. 
 Bun B: 
 Mirror mirror on the wall, who the realest of them all

 Mirror mirror on the wall, Is it right, is it wrong? 
 It is not hard, swear to God. These niggas ain't real at all

 Wale: 
 Mmm-mirror, tt-tell me she the realest. 
 I met her in the club and she wouldn't let me in it 
 S-seen her in a video, seen her in a magazine 
 See me I ain't frontin', we ain't see them titties last week 
 So far you nasty, ff-fuck you call that? 
 I call that insecure, sh-sh-shawty think she all that. 
 Ff-fuck outta here, that's how they gettin' gas 
 '09 Gold Diggers, walkin' with a different path 
 Find a dummy, wrap him up, let him fuck, suck him up 
 Gettin' good graces, take his money, aa-another one 
 No longer (Caffera?), Surgery and maskera 
 Looking at your money, 
 But c-can't look up in that mirror 
 Fearin what it show you, reality is gold 
 Real recognize real, real women don't know you 
 One of the coldest, the gracing On that pole 
 What them tempers don't see, 
 I bet that mirror gon show you. 
 Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the realest of them all
