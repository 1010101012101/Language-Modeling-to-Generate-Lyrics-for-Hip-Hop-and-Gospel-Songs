(1st Verse - Wale) 
 Top of the dome wit it or wrote lyrics 
 They ain't grossing a million, liquid don't form an opinion 
 I'm sort of a genius, nothing short of a legend 
 Sort of Tommy Lasorda 
 The way I'm sorting these pitchers 
 Pitchers whatever, f-ck it my speech is off 
 Weekend trip to wherever, only heaven is far 
 Metaphors in every color, these indelible bars 
 Jordan 4s seated floor side sitting with Mars 
 Only fear is mediocrity 
 Every time I got a beat I feel like I don't gotta sleep 
 You keep praying on your break, I hope you got a sling 
 Shot for all them shots coming out them beaks 
 Sort of like Socrates in a Prada T 
 You can't kick it, your pockets thinner than soccer teams 
 People f-ckin' with me, they ain't f-ckin with you 
 Lyrically sup hmm being generous too 
 I remember a nigga demo just sit in a room 
 Made some moves, now I'm known to spit December to June 
 Rented a coupe - cool - met me a chick 
 Always keep a rubber, word to telling your kids 
 If you gon do what you gon do, go handle your biz 
 Or smoke some purp take a Percocet and Xanax and chill 
 For real, you real then I don't need to say it 
 It's something to be great, it's nothing to be famous... 
 F-ck fame, f-ck money 
 F-ck everything anyone can take from me 
 It ain't hard to make money 
 We young niggas, we just tryna be legendary 
 (2nd Verse - Wale) 
 Zoning my 2nd bottle, focused still on tomorrow 
 'So what thoughts' keep me anxious, Moet gon' keep me calmer 
 Poetry keep her honest, these readings Stevie could draw up 
 Don't see this deeper than music, don't hear it but feel the author 
 I don't hear no talking, we just hear them barking 
 And you know you run shit when they pay you good for walk-ins 
 Failure is not an option, success is just a process 
 Say "yes" one time they use you, say "no" one time they plotting 
 Didn't make it through college, still debating my progress 
 End some friendships with homies, made some haters with albums 
 Limitations for cowards, this is Shay mixed with Malcolm 
 This is anti Mark McGuire it takes patience for power 
 Zoning my 6 -rillo legendaries forever 
 Roll a nigga that lala - that's how I play the -mello 
 Niggas plotting against you, hate you but never tell you 
 And I know my haters want to make my heart beat acapella 
 Hella proper, my garment is propeller of chopper 
 'Cause I hella copped 'em so I could be way flyer than all them 
 I Aspire for awesome and require some flossing 
 Only way they gon listen, find it highly unfortunate 
 Tryna see if real lyric spittin' can buy me a Porsche 
 Tryna see if I get my critics as silent as auctions 
 I decided to boss up, life's a bitch and I caught her 
 Don't always fuck me good, I'm just too cheap to divorce her
