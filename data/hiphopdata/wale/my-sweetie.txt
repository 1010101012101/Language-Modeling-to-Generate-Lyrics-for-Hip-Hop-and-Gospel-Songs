I need up, I needed to feel like you know 
 When your mother used to take you to the African party 
 You're my sweetie, my sugar, my lady, my lover 
 So honey, let me hold you, let me love you forever 
 Well, maybe not forever 
 Chain withdrawn when we not together 
 Best foot forward, holla at your boy 
 And I can get 'em all without lots of effort 
 Take her home, we can get it on 
 And make my jelof with lots of pepper 
 God has blessed her, prauda dresser 
 Mix my Guinness with a Dr. Pepper 
 I'm so naija, she so ibo, she so sweet, shortie feed my ego 
 Me bold dude, boladipo olu, whole crew, roll through 
 Got more green than whole foods 
 African queen got what you need, said my name Wale, ba wo ni 
 You're my sweetie, my sugar, my lady, my lover 
 So honey, let me hold you, let me love you forever 
 Who said I don't rap, I am naija all day 
 When I meet your mom I still du ba le 
 I am Wale, Oluwa 
 We be in the party like we own that bar 
 No regard when I'm going at a broad 
 And I go up in a party like I'm goin' abroad 
 Understand that's fly 
 Damn super fly guy land in Dubai 
 Y'all can't get it, I make y'all get it 
 Hate estate and my iPod wit it 
 Money on the floor, throw it on a broad 
 This is not ballin' but this is our culture 
 You is not hip then I cannot coach her 
 If it's not couture, I will not go to her 
 If it's not K9, I will not couture 
 Too much cognac, where's my chauffeur 
 You're my sweetie, my sugar, my lady, my lover 
 So honey, let me hold you, let me love you forever 
 Like money on the floor, spray it, spray it 
 Said, "There's Money on the floor, spray, it spray it" 
 Said, "There's Money on the floor, spray, it spray it" 
 Said, "There's Money on the floor, spray, it spray it" 
 Said, "There's Money on the floor, spray, it spray it" 
 Said, "There's Money on the floor, spray, it spray it" 
 Said, "There's Money on the floor, spray, it spray it" 
 Said, "There's Money on the floor"
