Turn a brick to a stone but you think we don't have a soul 
 As a kid need to grow, the powder's weight in gold 
 Getting blowed 
 Thinkin' I'm so glad that I can't rap 'cause I can't move no dough 
 But I do know a few niggas that did and a few niggas that still 
 And a few niggas that's through or a few niggas that's dead 
 So fuckin' 9 to 5, they clockin and tryna to survive 
 Cop a brick and supply 'cause nobody offerin jobs 
 Bricks build, buildings build, houses build neighborhoods 
 Better ripped than turned into a baller or a Davis shirt 
 Understated to say it hurts, I was optimistic 
 Tryna see my gang and whippin plain English that I was flippin 
 This college went out of his dollar pension 
 'Cause after 4 or 5 you don't got to have a college ticket 
 Bounce 
 But them niggas tryna hold my head and work this out 
 Countin' numbers up in my head tryna build this house 
 Mama told me if I made my bed then I gotta lay down 
 But I never seem to keep these words all up out my mouth 
 Bricks bricks - it's all them niggas talkin' bout 
 Bricks bricks - it's all them niggas talkin' bout 
 Bricks bricks - it's all them niggas thinkin' bout 
 Many niggas on the scene, ain't gotta dream it now 
 Tulio getting blowed 
 Thinkin' I'm so glad that I can't rap 'cause I can't move no dough 
 But I do know a few niggas that did and a few niggas that still 
 And a few niggas that's through or a few niggas that's dead 
 Look, little niggas will shoot you, they got nothing to say 
 'Cause local celebrities only 'bout a brick away 
 If you still whip 'em he getting those from whippin yay 
 And you got no paper, you been so patient, come get some weight 
 Just think about it, come see your products 
 And you weekend shoppin', show people no people problem 
 I can see the problem, you nigga don't have no conscience 
 Can't shoot, can't blow but can rap 
 Young nigga don't have no option 
 Turn a brick to a stone tryna feed for my homie 
 From the powder to the power and the power turn to gold 
 Turning head with yo whip 
 Is it worth what you did? 
 A brick is a brick and a brick you can build 
 Turn a brick to a stone tryna feed for my homie 
 Trenches on the full, turn reefer to a homie 
 Turn the powder into power and the power to the homies 
 A brick with a brick to a brick you can throw 
 Build bricks 
 Bricks 
 Bricks 
 Bricks 
 Many years old, feds lookin' for my moms 
 10 to 11 held my first gun 
 First time I held bricks I was getting construction 
 Tell me you puff a medical, gave him my introduction now 
 16, get them bricks for the 16 
 Course I'm rappin' bitch but now wrappin bricks for 16 
 I was 17 ridin' and then is all good 
 18 and 19 payin' nothing over 20 
 And 1008 divided by 4 is 2-52 
 If you know what that mean you noticed it now 
 And if you don't learn how to divide nigga 
 I'm talkin' bricks, no jump shots 
 I call it work, no punch clocks 
 But them niggas tryna hold my head and work this out 
 Countin' numbers up in my head tryna build this house 
 Mama told me if I made my bed then I gotta lay down 
 But I never seem to keep these words all up out my mouth 
 Bricks bricks - it's all them niggas talkin' bout 
 Bricks bricks - it's all them niggas talkin' bout 
 Bricks bricks - it's all them niggas thinkin' bout 
 Many niggas on the scene, ain't gotta dream it now 
 Bricks bricks - it's all them niggas talkin' bout 
 Bricks bricks - it's all them niggas talkin' bout 
 Bricks bricks - it's all them niggas thinkin' bout 
 Many niggas on the scene, ain't gotta dream it now 
 Million to a stone, the stone to the sour 
 The show in the hood and you know that you could 
 The powder and the crack and the crack to the suns 
 Dollars in the bag and the glocks in the front...
