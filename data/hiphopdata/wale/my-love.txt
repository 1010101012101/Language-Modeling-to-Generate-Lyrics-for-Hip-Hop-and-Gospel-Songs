You've been here, but you've been missin' for some time now 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Every time I see you, it's a different vibe now 
 I can't help but let you just slip away 
 Can we get back what we had yesterday? 
 If I ride with you 
 Better know that I'ma ride for you 
 Bet I'd use a gun and knife for you 
 I ain't finna choose the side over you 
 If I ride with you 
 Ain't nothin' to provide for you 
 Ain't nobody in my life like you 
 Ain't nobody gonna shine like you 
 Show me my love, oh god 
 Show me sweet love, yeah 
 Show me my love, oh yeah 
 Show me sweet love, yeah 
 See, show me my love 
 My team, team, we on that new ting 
 My mink draggin' like it's Liu Kang 
 My show packed, all the dimes there 
 But I be falling back from all the loose change 
 I drop the top on that new thing 
 My chocolate broad, they rock Gucci 
 Gotta know it's impossible to stop Folarin 
 Got the box, I want the new thing, yeah 
 She gon' show out, show out 
 Before its wahala, "Roll out, roll out" 
 She gon' show out, show out 
 Before you break it down, girl, roll out, roll out 
 If I ride with you 
 Better know that I'ma ride for you 
 Better know that we can live for each other 
 That don't mean I gotta die for you 
 Show me my love, oh god 
 Show me sweet love, yeah 
 Show me my love, oh yeah 
 Show me sweet love, yeah 
 See, show me my love 
 Yeah, bring 'em out, bring 'em out 
 Hard to hear, too many girls in the house, ay 
 Bring 'em out, bring 'em out 
 I started here, I got the buzz and the clout 
 I know, I know she got it all, but got nothin' to hold 
 Every time I saw her, not too many know 
 She ain't really hard, she act because she hurt, duh 
 And I can be your last 
 Leave the past with your first 
 Show me my love, oh god 
 Show me sweet love, yeah 
 Show me my love, oh yeah 
 Show me sweet love, yeah 
 See, show me my love 
 Show me sweet love, yeah 
 Show me my love 
 Show me sweet love, yeah
