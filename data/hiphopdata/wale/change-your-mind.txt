Imagine when your far away... 
 Searching for the words to say... 
 I feel it when you fall apart... 
 Our lives aren't great as arts... 
 I don't wanna change your mind... 
 'Cause I except you for... 
 Everything you done and did will be stay here with me now... 
 Oh Oh... 
 The only love is the part inside your changing face... 
 Don't walk away you can change your mind... 
 Never Ever I thought of that... 
 A sick thing is following meh! 
 You gotta stop that P Diddy, P Diddy... 
 Never be Hold in Arms... 
 Scolding those bad Ehrams... 
 You don't wanna walk away... 
 You can change your mind... 
 Oh Oh you never live me... 
 Never ever... 
 Change your Mi_____nd...
