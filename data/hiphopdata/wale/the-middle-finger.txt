Now, one of the services you provide is giving them something to talk about. 
 Let 'em talk. It makes 'em happy, it makes 'em feel good. 
 They don't believe half the shit they say. 
 People wanna talk. Yeah, it's fun to talk 
 Hate to be the bearer of bad news 
 But I can't move with too many rap dudes 
 I respect dudes from my double M crew 
 But I'm just not that dude hanging on to who's who's and such 
 Cash rule for some, got room for none 
 Can't fool with niggas who put the rumors up 
 Wanted to quit, rap music sucks 
 But couldn't run a 4.2, so with you I'm stuck 
 Went in the booth, truth? the only tool I trust 
 And that's sayin' a lot, 'cause Pro Tools be stuck 
 You grindin' hot, they wanna be cool with yah 
 They're like consignment shops, they're old news to us 
 Society, I trip 'em 
 Aye well look now 
 I got to be the realest 
 Aye well look now 
 Society, I trip 'em 
 Aye well look now 
 Should follow no nigga 
 Just the god inside of my mirror 
 Fuck you, leave me alone (aye well look now) 
 Fuck you, leave me alone (aye well look now) 
 Fuck you, leave me alone (aye well look now) 
 Fuck you, leave me alone (aye well look now) 
 Fuck you, leave me alone 
 Fuck you, leave me alone 
 Fuck you, leave me alone 
 Fuck you, leave me alone 
 Fightin' for my respect, receive it or nothin' else 
 Preachin' and geekin', I kinda think that I'm Malcolm X 
 MDMA in my juice, jaws tired and through 
 Now I'm sweatin' 'cause the bitches, they perspired me to 
 Are you judgin' me now? Do you fuck with me now? 
 Miscarried my first child, ain't finna come out 
 Fuck the therapy route, where the syrup and loud? 
 Blue 30 come around, there's the smile 
 Opiated, could show up later with more elation 
 All my bitches say, "Take it easy, enjoy the paper" 
 Try to be with the people, see what I'm fightin' 
 Them inner demons, and how it was eatin' me while I be in Vegas 
 Yeah, life a gamble anyway jo 
 Pop a perc, I could merk through the pain though 
 Mind bills pilin' up, drop a single 
 Thrill's all gone when that mothafuckin' fame go 
 Ever seen a mix J Cole and Django? 
 Educated, shit, but he whip like he ain't though 
 Black bitches say my shit is so graceful 
 White bitches barely know me up in Graystone 
 Society, I trip 'em 
 Aye well look now 
 I got to be the realest 
 Aye well look now 
 Society, I trip 'em 
 Aye well look now 
 Should follow no nigga 
 Just the god inside of my mirror 
 Fuck you, leave me alone (aye well look now)
