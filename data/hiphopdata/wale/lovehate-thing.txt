Hold me tight, let me go 
 In my heart, in my soul 
 Let 'em go, break me down 
 Hate me small, make me fall 
 Give me love, take it all away 
 Give me love, take it all away 
 Ain't no love in the heart of city, that's what they told me 
 Beefing over 100 niggas, don't none of 'em know me 
 Son of a mother studying everything I see 
 Sitting in taxi cabs, where daddy roaming the streets 
 Seven hallelujahs, my sutana was clean 
 On everything I weared are the American tee's 
 This whole system the most prolific in the DMV 
 Listen when you get the keys to sell 'em you don't get the beef 
 Make a nigga wanna get the piece to get the peace 
 You gon' need more than Wikipedia to get to me 
 PG to Mo County bet they all know 'bout me 
 Every hood, every 'burb, I got superb balance 
 From the city that made me love you forever for it 
 Hope you celebrate every moment forever ignore it 
 You made me what I am, you made me what I am not 
 They gon' love you a little different when you at the top 
 Give me love baby 
 Not enough, not enough, just a touch baby 
 What the fuck baby, it's just us baby 
 This ain't right, this is life 
 This is love hate thing 
 Give me love baby 
 Not enough, not enough, just a touch baby 
 What the fuck baby, it's just us baby 
 This ain't right, this is life 
 This is love hate thing 
 Hold me tight, let me go 
 In my heart, in my soul 
 Let 'em go, break me down 
 Hate me small, make me fall 
 Give me love, take it all away 
 Give me love, take it all away 
 Yeah, my infinty grows as the city gets cold 
 As you reaching your goals, you gon' meet you some folds 
 Having dinner with I'm dreaming to own 
 But for now me and my homies see the bottom floor 
 I'm trying to redefine the culture, and a bigger soul 
 Women in town but I manifesting every goal 
 I see potential in John, talk to him once a week 
 I lost a lot of friends, and they ain't even dead 
 When I was on my way up when why you ain't see the stairs 
 Lord father if I opted to follow them 
 My heart would tear from my dreams let me know that you here 
 And it's rare when I'm anywhere with too many heads 
 Niggas jealous and never tell it until they stare 
 How could you blame us envy 
 We do the same thing for a living 
 Champagne I'mma spill it until we fill up 
 Maybe it stopped me from giving a fuck about opinions 
 Probably not but I'm temperorary out of fizux 
 Until the posterly propaganda the politicians 
 Hold me tight, let me go 
 In my heart, in my soul 
 Let 'em go, break me down 
 Hate me small, make me fall 
 Give me love, take it all away 
 Give me love, take it all away
