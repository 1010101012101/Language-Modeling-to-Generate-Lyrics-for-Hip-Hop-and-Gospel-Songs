 All them niggas pitch verbs, so they say 
 My weaponry is words, Doe-Ray-Me 
 The wars in the form of po-et-ry 
 So it's straight C4 from the thoughts I bring, Bang 
 Epiphany, them niggas is gimmicks to me

 Huh, I'm that bomb when that hand right

 Park my plane right there, Leave the key's with that bitch, Jets. 
 Spitta flip syllables for residuals

 Livin' underground like a godfather buried alive 
 I ride by bumpin' Shine I do just that 
 Nigga ain't nothin' sweet like a Kool-Aid pack 
 Bitches roll sweets as I lay back in the sweet 
 Developin' cavities cause revenge is sweet 
 Every time I rap I unwrap another piece 
 An eighth of grape ape hella joints to the head got my eyes all varsity red 
 Sunroof flow so over your head, SB horror pack monsters under my bed
