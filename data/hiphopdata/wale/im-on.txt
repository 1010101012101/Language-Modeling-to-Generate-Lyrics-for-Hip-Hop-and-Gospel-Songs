I'm on, I'm on, I'm on 
 Ooh yeah 
 I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on 
 I'm on, I'm on, I'm on 
 Yeah, glitterati, big bodies and tall swings 
 Devil on me, spittlefields and all saints 
 Playing field ain't leveling the lane 
 Throwin' stones at ya bones kick pebbles at your pain 
 Swear they go hard 
 But they sold jello in the pain 
 Tryna Carmelo but he came 
 Lord have mercy but we be having that jersey 
 Flowin' so hungry, rappin' that thirsty 
 Think fast, fast women like Jackie Joyner-Kersee 
 Fast life like born on Wednesday and died on Thursday 
 Fast money like zakat of fitr, break-fast 
 Slow my roll like break pads 
 'Cause if you run the light 
 They just might stop you niggas 
 Rodney King on the dome, just things that I'm On 
 I'm on this one way headed where the slums play 
 If I don't make it, then somebody tell my son? 
 Struggling first class, headed for the runway 
 Real nigga shit I gotta make it one day 
 Hard times so I tell 'em to fall back 
 All white but the Phantom is all black 
 For everything I lost tell 'em I want it all back 
 Everyone who left me for nothing tell 'em to call back 
 They ain't authentic, Tell them I don't even relate 
 Minus the love feel like I was something to hate 
 Tell them hate now 
 The World looking out, they on the front row 
 Everybody looking now 
 I used to have dark nights now it's bright lights 
 Daytime bus pass, now it's night flights 
 Had a poor man swag now it's priced right 
 Always wanted a piece of the pie, now it's sliced right 
 Yeah you can tell 'em I'm home 
 The streets in need of a king, you can tell 'em I'm home 
 Used to be at the bottom, tell 'em it wasn't for long 
 Now I'm always in the hood like I was never gon' 
 I'm home, tell 'em I'm something they couldn't cut off 
 Try to hit the switch if you want I ain't gon' cut off 
 A 100 thousand volts a true thing gon' shut off 
 Anything in the way is gon' get permanently shut off 
 Never letting go, although sometimes I split like banana peels for heels 
 My spill is so legit, know the scent every time I pick up the microphone and spit 
 Eyes wide, ears open like you on a doctors visit 
 But this ain't physics or rocket science 
 This a little tune to keep you motivated and inspired 
 I am not a motivational speaker but people get easily motivated 
 When they hear BIG reeking 
 Havoc on the track boi, grab it hold it tight 
 My city, growl with me, hoochi hoo'ing through the night sky 
 Bunch of fly, bow tie, made my mark like the craters on the moon 
 Rocking alligator shoes I'm on 
 You know me, cool breeze, a nigga high 
 Rather live alone forever than live a lie 
 I'm in the zone, phone pro's keepin' me comfy 
 Got squares, dark squares cover my luggage 
 I'm in love with some women, more in love with my mother 
 I'm in love with my God, less in love with this money 
 And my loving is off, got a bigger cigar 
 Out in Vegas with broads, bout as thick as Toccara 
 My ambition is ammunition if this is war 
 They can't run, they can't run, this is a war 
 Got forever indurance, forever under purists 
 I put my breath in this muthafucka 
 They better hear it 
 Good rhythm, bad women and better lyrics 
 My only dream to get rich and never marry 
 Give these niggas the pink slip when they appear 
 And I ain't trippin', my only competition's the mirror. 
 Remember they used to be like who is this 
 Now I'm up in this bitch 
 Smoking weed out in London they bringing me fish and chips 
 Thought of this as a young'un 
 Who know this be the life that I really live 
 Now I'm flying on trips, promoters and owners giving me gifts 
 Don't gotta shop, I ain't payin' for shit 
 This Audemar on my wrist, got it harder than miss 
 Older people looking at me how I bought all of this 
 I say I got it from grindin', perfect timing 
 Started at the bottom, ain't afraid to climb it 
 Took something rough and turn it to a diamond 
 It ain't come easy, had to find it 
 And now you can't say I got game 'cause I define it 
 Nigga I'm on like the light and if I ever fall off 
 I'll be back on the same night 
 Me and my dogs we on the same flight 
 Carefree I don't need the stress 
 Smoking Khaled, my weed the best
