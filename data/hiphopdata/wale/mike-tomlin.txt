(Wale) 
 Black and Yellow bottles at my table, I'm ballin' 
 Black and yellow ladies at my section, I called 'em 
 Balck and yellow, balck and yellow SS 
 Black and yellow everything n-gga, Mike Tomlin 
 Look at my carnage, bitches be astonished 
 Up all night with college hoes, edibles and bong hits 
 This just ain't no song sh-t, do this for my city Joe 
 Bout to get my city on, had to let me city go 
 Shout outs to my Philly hoes, told her drop that eagle o 
 Called that b-tch my quaterback, wild cat all that 
 Give it to these broads, I make 'em soar back and all that 
 You don't sleep on nothing but a comforter and skull cap 
 Me I never call 'em back, she said that y'all go together 
 She just let me beat in you, an acapello kind fella, black and yellow 
 Yeah ain't that what the song say 
 What you calla lifetime, I just call a long day 
 (Wiz Khalifa) 
 Ah ha, you know what it is... 
 (Wale) 
 It's no days off, you ain't doing sh-t 
 Shout outs to them Taylors and them Jets fool 
 It feel like Woodstock in a n-gga dressing room 
 Looking at my opposition like bust and move 
 From where they take them old beats and turn 'em into news 
 You can end this verse premature 
 But I got sceptics and some fans that just be needing more 
 Louie D don't see the score, going in and leave it gone 
 Flyer than the rest of 'em, Ima (?) to reinforce 
 I don't be in wars, so I don't need a fort 
 I just be in the cut, my n-gga Neosporin 
 Some n-ggas slept on me but I don't see the snoring 
 Some n-ggas sayin' bullsh-t but they don't be important 
 They don't want, my attention, I'm cool cousin 
 A lil liquor a lil rose for my lil young'n 
 A n-gga suffer, ain't eating nothing they still bluffin 
 While I go hard and spit retarded like them little busta's 
 I'm still buzzin', chick is something like n-gga f-ck it 
 Y'all little n-ggas like lil bustas with lil budgets 
 You lil n-ggas is silly you think my n-ggas budging 
 I think you n-ggas funny, I leave you n-ggas bludgeoned 
 Hold up... ok 
 Black and yellow j-force, always wear a rubber so they never ever late for it 
 Than we celebrate when they on it 
 She can nip it in the bud and leave that b-tches face warm, yuughck! 
 In my best Pusha imitation 
 B-tch I be ballin' on the low like the chim is baking 
 And I'ma need some more Patron I don't want no chaser 
 I'm throwing hundreds at KOD, a little paper 
 And you're girl working out, I let my n-ggas train her 
 You Tim Tebow ass n-ggas probably still gater 
 I chump chump p-ssy if it smell good to me 
 And I don't do nothing to her but she do it to me 
 I'm trifling, damn right ignorant 
 Mic magnificant, you're all simpletons 
 It's a (?), bitches blind dating (?) 
 Baby I ain't liping, I just tend to keep my city there 
 On my back boy, holla back boy 
 Half a mill rap touring, Jarrett Jack boy 
 Black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow
