Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying, 
 Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying 
 I walked up and asked what's wrong, 
 She told me that the radio's been playing the same song all day long 
 So I told her I got something you've been waiting for, 
 I got something you've been waiting for 
 Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying, I walked up and asked what's wrong, she told me that 
 The radio's been playing the same song all day long 
 So get your glass lift it up in the toast position 
 We getting paper like John Travolta get it 
 'Cause we focused with it we supposed to get it 
 You know me and my whole squad we so committed 
 We not the kids coolin' out on the sofa wit it 
 We about to dominate the globe like Oprah did it 
 We getting paper like John Travolta nigga 
 Well I'm a downtown shoota who that? 
 The crown ruler is back 
 He congruent to the shape of a mack 
 Look how I do it yo I'm takin' you back 
 This how you rise down to the foundation how sacred is that? 
 I'm from the number one place on the map 
 The generational gap with yet another sensational track 
 And we don't stress for nothing I just press the button 
 It's as simple as just makin' it hap 
 To all the frauds stop fakin' relax 
 And to the broads if you cakin' 
 Then clap then shake it without breakin' your back 
 I know the world been waitin' for that you been aching fa that 
 'Cause what they playin' on the station is wack 
 And I'm a legend in the flesh that dress to impress 
 The best is that which I accept and nothing less 
 My stacks is grotesque my squad is so fresh 
 You know its Black Thought and your boy the Bro Quest, but 
 So get your glass lift it up and in toast position 
 We getting paper like John Travolta get it 
 'Cause we focused wit it we supposed to get it 
 You know me and my whole squad we so committed 
 We got the kids coolin' out on the sofa wit it 
 We about to dominate the globe like Oprah did it 
 You getting paper like John Travolta nigga so lets go 
 Hip-Hop ain't dead cause the pulse is in us 
 I got the everclear flow they mimosa wit it 
 We are the hope of the culture they posed to listen 
 And I'm posed to pivot like I'm a forward in the league, I'm Oden wit it 
 Yet don't owe them niggas nothin' but potent lyrics 
 But if you ain't gotta dance they revoke your spinnin' 
 So good rappers ain't eatin' they Olsen twinin' 
 But I'm so committed, they have grown familiar 
 With the counterfeit hitters they so so with it but they a Sosa with it. 
 They Mark McGuire with the writtin' I'm Rodriguez 
 On the road to riches this is the fork I'm hittin' 
 This is the trial and error era no co defendant 
 I push the seed every time like I'm Cody wit it 
 I said they one hit wonders pneumonia to us 
 I don't know you niggas hit the road my nigga 
 Where my grimey figures at? look lively addressing the captain 
 Show me where your first impression is at 
 And where your dedication to the true profession is at 
 How you laugh answer me what kind of question is that 
 I'll show you where my rare essence is at the adolescence of rap 
 The real muscle in the message of that 
 My name trouble I'm a blessin' to rap 
 And you can check my stats cause worldwide they attesting to that 
 So nigga listen you can probably learn a lesson perhaps 
 How I'm like bobby DeNiro Joe Pesc and them cats 
 Am I the unsung hero oh yes if you askin' anybody that's aware of the classics 
 They'll tell you I'm a legend in the flesh that dress to impress 
 The best is that which I accept and nothing less 
 My stacks is grotesque my squad? so fresh 
 You know its Black Thought and your boy the BroQuest, but
