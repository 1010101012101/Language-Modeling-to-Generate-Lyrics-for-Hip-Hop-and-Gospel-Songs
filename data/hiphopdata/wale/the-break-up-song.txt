Yeah 
 See, breaking up is hard to move along is even harder 
 It's over she got colder now can't locate where her heart is 
 And I'm just being honest, since we not even talking 
 My mind won't let you go 
 Shit even considered stalking now 
 You know I be teasin' though 
 You know that my ego won't 
 Thought this was forever love 
 Guess that was just seasonal 
 She got back with her old boy 
 She's probably had a reason though 
 Although thought that we would grow 
 Guess I wasn't feasible 
 But we ain't gonna be beefin' though 
 I missed you at my recent show 
 I speak to CJ Often and 
 Sometimes I just wanna speak you up 
 Yeah, hit you up, or call you up, or send a text 
 Your new man got my respect 
 So if I do call it's just to check 
 Heard that you all right though 
 My nigga for life though 
 It's funny how this life go 
 We love for a while then a light goes 
 Took me a while just to write those 
 Pride I had a fight so I'mma stop right here 
 And I know you don't care 
 But I hope you got that bite boo 
 Yeah tell me 'bout the love of ours 
 Contemplate I wrote about it 
 We no longer close or nuttin 
 That's why she ignore my flowers 
 And my call and my text 
 Spendin' her time wit him I guess 
 I regret some shit I did 
 But darling is y'all intimate 
 Who was better I know I was 
 Don't you lie don't blow my buzz 
 You ask me who I'm strokin' now 
 I said that the pool is closed 
 Can we stay broken up 
 And all these pages close 'em up 
 I hope we both do learn from this 
 So my next don't don't gotta be so rough 
 Gotta get better wit time 
 Relationships should never rewind 
 Better leave it all behind 
 Guess that mean you could never be mine 
 Well umm there's a but 
 Without your love it's cold as fuck 
 Life is a movie we both say cut 
 But most times darlin' the sequel sucks
