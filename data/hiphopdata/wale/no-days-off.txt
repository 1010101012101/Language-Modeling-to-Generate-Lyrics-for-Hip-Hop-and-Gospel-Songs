Revolution might be televised 
 But make sure if they do see 
 Them people see my good side 
 Black nigga with intellect 
 6th grade I was Special Ed 
 10th grade I was red as shit 
 Lookin' like a nigga just left Japan 
 Well goddamn, now I be the man 
 Now every bitch kickin' with me, and every bitch kickin it with me goin' Mia Hamm goin' HAM 
 Every visit to Neimans, I swear don't even see a tag 
 When you're reachin' your dreams 
 You got reason to brag 
 Ambition over everything 
 And I never plan on settling 
 And my wish is to have everything 
 And my only fear's a wedding ring 
 Hopin' that my niggas see 
 Hopin' that these bitches saw it 
 Hopin' when it's break in here 
 I got he same addition for it 
 Niggas think I'm slippin, niggas is lunchin' 
 Either dumb or smokin' dippers or something. 
 No days off! No days off! 
 Heard they coming for a nigga 
 Bitch I'm Ray Charles 
 No days off! 
 Takin' breaks will leave you broken 
 And we can't fall 
 No days off! No days off! 
 Heard they coming for a nigga 
 Bitch I'm Ray Charles 
 No days off! 
 Takin' breaks will leave you broken 
 And we can't fall 
 I used to sleep hungry in a bed next to roaches 
 Now I wake up, play a beat and burn a couple roaches 
 Permanently focused, learning while I'm going 
 And the word most important 
 Don't regurgitate my sperm 
 Let me work that - no nasty 
 But I'm actually quite respectful 
 But you call a bitch a bitch 
 And real bitches don't respect you 
 And that's fucked up 
 But I guess that shit's just tough love 
 Around my way, I'm cut throat 
 And what I did just ain't enough 
 Fly shit ain't not thang to us... 
 20 somethin', no baby ma 
 Mama want me to go find a wife 
 I'm like sorry ma, this not the time 
 Can't decide, take 'em out 
 G'd up, shake it down 
 Weed up, better make a sound 
 Greened up, I'm like De La Salle 
 Higher than high school 
 Mariah tunes and five flutes 
 Or 5'2" hoopers in light shoes 
 Never liked school 
 Reckless when I move 
 Where I from, it get cold 
 Niggas die over shoes 
 Niggas shoot over bitches 
 Bitches get niggas set up 
 Stuck up beat up and wet up 
 That's why I never met em 
 That's why forever I love seldom and trust never 
 And fuck whoever don't put one hundred percent in 
 Nigga
