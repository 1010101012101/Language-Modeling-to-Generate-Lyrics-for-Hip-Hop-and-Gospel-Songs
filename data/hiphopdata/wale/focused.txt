(Kid Cudi) 
 Shorty, no jokin' 
 And I'm hopin', I'm not slowin' 
 Got to just keep on rollin' 
 I'm joking (young boy movin' fast) 
 And I'm hopin' (pray that I don't crash) 
 (All I know is) I'm not slowin' 
 Gotta just keep on rollin' 
 Gotta keep at it, gotta stay focused 
 Young boy moving fast 
 And I'm hoping, pray that I don't crash 
 All I know is I'm not slowin' 
 Gotta just keep on rollin' 
 Gotta keep at it, gotta stay focused 
 (Verse 1 - Wale) 
 Pull in once, I'mma lit mine up 
 Fill up the plug, let me light my blunt 
 And I don't really know what the fucks in my cup 
 But a couple shots of it got a nigga unstuck 
 I'm just here to have a good time 
 A lil white chick, a lil white wine 
 Outta town, spent a couple nights at Chows 
 Smoking weed in the suites, till we out of towels 
 And don't bother me, high shit for my broccoli 
 Fly shit for no goddamn reason and y'all aight but y'all not like me 
 It's MMG and that's my clique 
 That's BOA see that's my set 
 My CDG shit'll match my kicks 
 An apostrophe I'm behind that S 
 Or that black Beamer, black to pick me up 
 Back wood, the tree I'm ashing out. See, I been kickin my raps good 
 With or without sales I'm killing these blackheads my rap is Noxzema 
 Haha, light it up for a nigga, one or two hoes ain't enough for a nigga 
 One or two bottles ain't enough for a nigga 
 Redberry everywhere got Puff gettin' jealous 
 (Kid Cudi - Chorus) 
 (Verse 2 - Wale) 
 One night love, I'mma need that 
 He could own that, shawty, I'mma lease that 
 I'mma put you in the game where your kicks at 
 I'mma sign that work then release that 
 I don't be where the crowds or police at 
 I just be where the cash and the freaks at 
 Smoking Green Bay nigga, I'm a cheese head 
 In a Lambo, see me with the G's at 
 $10K in my camos, word. 10 Js and I can't move 
 Shades LV was a little dough 
 Going hard for the days I was piss poor 
 And go hard 'cause I feel it's only right to 
 Maybach. G.O.O.D music, the right move 
 Girls say everything that I write smooth 
 Fuck rap, I'm getting pussy off of Haiku 
 One time for the girls with the right shoes 
 Fuckin' with a dude probably the right move 
 Two times for the chicks with the right back 
 If it's right tonight, I might bite that 
 3 times, show me your peace sign 
 Not with your hand girl, open your knees out 
 Look, money will leap out, stuntin when we out 
 Double MG, OUT! 
 (Kid Cudi - Chorus)
