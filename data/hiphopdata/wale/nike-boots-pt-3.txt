 Southside what up, 
 Uptown what up, 
 PG what up, 
 Moco what up! 
 (Verse 1: jennifer malsch) 
 The revolution of an era, 
 You think you're revolutionary 'cause you got a shirt with Che Guevera 
 Look in the mirror and tell me what you see 
 Decked out Commonwealth 
 Yeah I'm rockin' Stussy 
 Got my Nike Boots with the laces all crossed 
 Welcome to DC shout out Mambo Sauce 
 On Billboard for weeks and more weeks to come 
 DC's on the map so y'all better run 
 DC is my city and I'm pretty sure 
 That from Potomac to the Eastern Shore 
 Never ever have we ever done it ever before 
 And although we getting close the DMV's got more 
 Jennifer malsch: 
 Just check the Nike swoosh 
 'Cause we will carry you 
 And DC Maryland Virginia, yeah we got a truce! 
 Flyer than the rest of 'em! [x4] 
 WALE:

 (Verse 2: jennifer malsch) 
 But they forget what to remember 
 Just know the DMV it's got a brand new music member forever 
 Don't waste your temper 
 Don't bother hating on me 
 Rock, hip hop, and r & b 
 Always be a part of me 
 95.5 and 93.9 been doing what they do like Amy Dub does lines 
 And I been a star but you ain't seen me shine 
 It goes through your ears and runs down your spine 
 Jennifer malsch: 
 Just check the Nike swoosh 
 'Cause we will carry you 
 And DC Maryland Virginia, yeah we got a truce! 
 Flyer than the rest of 'em! [x4]

 (Verse 3: lil wayne) 
 If it's bullshit they want, bullshit I shall 
 Yeah I'm a break 'em off, nig go head and tell 
 Red lobster every day, shrimp heads and tails 
 And bad bitches give me head and tell 
 And bad bitches give me head and tell 
 See I'm ahead but you stay the snail 
 I move, they see the back of my Nikes 
 Got to the end of the tunnel and I was the light 
 Always strapped so I was all right 
 Naked women rub my back and ask me how was my night 
 I say bitch stay out my business 
 When we fuck, she say just stay out my kidneys 
 And don't say it if Simon didn't 
 America idolize a nigga 
 But they better come bitch out me 
 And you are you too but bitch I'm three!
