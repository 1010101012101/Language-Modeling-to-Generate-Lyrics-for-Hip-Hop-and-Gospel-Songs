(Boy) Beautiful (x7) 
 Uh, 
 Chip on my shoulder big enough to feed Cambodia see I Neva fit into they quotas 
 Sneakers wasn't fitting and my knees needed lotion long before I knew the significance of a comb 
 I roam like phone with no vocal reception immigrant parents had me feeling like a step kid 
 And black Americans Neva did accept me that's why I grab so much when respect dig

 Couldn't adapt to naps I wear caps they nap and slept on me man I hate black 
 Skin tone I wish I could take it back or rearrange my status maybe if I was khaki 
 Associating light skin with classy the menstrual show showed a me that was not me 
 Black is beautiful but, but ask them beautiful light girls if its black they attract to usually 
 What if Barack skin was all black truthfully would he be a candidate or just a blackened community because black dudes tend to lack unity and them black girls ain on the tube usually 
 Right Now at 23 I ain mad at them reds no more but for long time I had gone cold in
