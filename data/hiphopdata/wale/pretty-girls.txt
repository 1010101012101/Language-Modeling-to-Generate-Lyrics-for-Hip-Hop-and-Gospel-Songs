Girls, I ask 'em do they smoke? 
 Ask 'em what do they know? 
 Ask 'em can we go? Pretty girls... 
 Sunshine in the air, perfume everywhere 
 Girls are everywhere 
 Thanks to the flow right now what up 
 A lime to a lemon remind you of the sky when I'm fuckin' and we on cloud nine for that minute 
 Admire your style and your physique 
 And I ain't trying to critique but you deserve a good drink, so what's up? 
 What you sippin on? Its no problem 
 Black and gold models like I'm pro-New Orleans 
 But shawty I'm far from a saint but I got two A-mex's that look the same way

 And I ain't trying to lead you wrong sugar I need ya

 Not for tonight, but for tomorrow's amnesia
