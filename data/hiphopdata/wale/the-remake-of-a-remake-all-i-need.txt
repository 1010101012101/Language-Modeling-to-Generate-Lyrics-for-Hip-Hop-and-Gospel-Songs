Listen 
 Shorty I'm here for you any time you need me 
 For real girl, it's me in your world, believe me 
 Nothin' make a man feel better than a woman, (nothing) 
 Queen wit a crown that be down for whatever 
 In this life, nothing is forever, my lady 
 We can make more, make babies 
 Back when I was nothing, you made a brother feel like he was something (yep) 
 So now I show you off to the block no fronting 
 Even when the skies is grey, and my money was low 
 But now the dough like Kaiser bro 
 Not relying on the light no more 
 'Cause every night the light kisses, she blow the only shot I know 
 Could make the eyes of the blind perform 
 I got my wife, so fuck the ring 
 The ice ain't really nothing to her 
 And I ain't frontin' for her 
 She know just what it is 
 And I got mad love to give 
 You my ni-- 
 Like the sweet morning dew, I took one look at you 
 And it was plain to see, you were my destiny 
 With my arms open wide, I threw away my pride 
 I'll sacrifice for you, dedicate my life for you 
 I will go where you lead 
 Always there in time of need 
 And when I lose my will 
 You'll be there to push me up the hill 
 There's no, no looking back for us 
 We got love sure 'nough, that's enough 
 Said, you're all, you're all I need to get by 
 You're all I need to get by 
 Yeah 
 I got a love Jones for your body and skin tone 
 5 minutes alone and I'm already on the you know 
 Whenever I'm through, you already on the phone 
 That's why all your lil homies plotting to get me on 
 But no, head over heels you better get me 
 Forever all about you like Wrigleys, (woo) 
 It be true, me for you, that's how it is 
 I'll be your Noah, you be my Wiz 
 I'm your Mr. and you my Mrs., 
 With hugs and kisses, valentine cards and birthday wishes 
 Please, we avoid Pagan the pace is far more amazing 
 Than a maze raced by the legless 
 Won't stray where the hate is 
 Haters just hate but yet they don't know squat like a leg lift 
 This is love, nothing else close 
 Now I'm signing off, so let my girl go (go)
