(Seinfeld Skit) 
 Talking: 
 Versatility for everything. Shoutout to all the uh, intuitions, secrets, ya know? 
 Uh, good love... and I can do that for her. 
 I can do it to a nigga, make a pull on her. 
 It's temporary lust, you need an in-showing. 
 Now for this time being, let's be in love with the moment. 
 Okay you dancin', drinkin' on your last one. 
 I'm just tryna poke her face, that's why I got my hand in. 
 Grown man shit, tonight, no romance shit. 
 And you should make this bedroom like a Monday night at Magic. 
 Like a Gigi McGuire, now let me up inside. 
 I give you that massage; good hygiene is required. I don't want no dirty junk. 
 I just want a girly-girl that own a rack of Jordans but don't sport 'em 'cause she love her pumps. 
 Give my love to no one else. kiss that cookie till it melt. 
 I am going underwater... Michael Phelps! 
 Do it till I'm tired or your homegirl can provide the help or you can be Ms. Independent- 
 Make that movie by yourself! 
 Okay, my game tight. My game right. 
 Don't even know her name until I know her taste right. 
 I said my game tight and my game tight. 
 Don't even know her name until I know her taste, right? 
 Okay, I think this time we make moves. No clothes required here. 
 Shawty, can I taste you after that Moscato hit? 
 We both grown and I don't care. Not so fast, don't tie yo' hair. 
 She say, "my love is outta here." She out of all her outerwear. 
 And I am real and I am raw. 
 But don't go in raw 'cause I'm prepared. 
 See that's a hazard if y'all ain't know. 
 I got them gold wrappers like 500 sold. 
 Got that deep love, purify that woman so. 
 Get it so good, I make that mothafucka somersault. 
 Tell me anything you want, I'm a keep that on the low. 
 I just wanna please you so tell me where I need to go. 
 Okay, my game tight. My game right. 
 Don't even know her name until I know her taste right. 
 I said my game tight and my game tight. 
 Don't even know her name until I know her taste, right?
