In the grand scheme of things 
 We never were supposed to have shit 
 Born to lose, built to win 
 Folarin 
 Let's get it in 
 We ain't supposed to never have nothing 
 We ain't supposed to never have shit 
 See the growth in my rhymes 
 See my focus ain't on them 
 Nah, at the top is just us, right 
 Let's get it 
 PRPS, something nice you ain't know 'em 
 Givenchy, but no kilt, mi amor 
 We can't leave, but we love the allure 
 Hold mine down and stay above what you on 
 On, I'm appeased and obliged 
 Scorpio freaks quantity Gemini 
 I'm a need me a light 
 Ridin' through the cap, Cap STEEZ on the mind 
 I ain't know him but I wish I did 
 Each one, teach one, may the youth live 
 On that, Joey Bad please hold your head 
 Lost one last summer, livin' ain't fair 
 While them niggas scared, we forever in 
 Hates see you smile, money everywhere 
 Dream killers out, I see them in the rear 
 Before I put them in a song, put them in a prayer 
 Amen 
 We ain't supposed to never have nothing 
 We ain't supposed to never have shit 
 See the growth in my rhymes 
 See my focus ain't on them 
 Yeah, I'm focused, it's Folarin here 
 I reckon your barbershop talk of this 
 Heavenly father, may the spirit of God 
 Help whoever at odds get your guidance quick 
 All we need Keisha, all we need Becky 
 All we need is God, and fed free fetti 
 My little buddy lives strong, young nigga peddle 
 He ain't make it in the leagues, so the streets wed him 
 Gettin' wet up on the corner in whatever weather 
 Boy see the jail again, he gonna see the devil 
 Been a week since he seen his mother 
 And 18 since he seen the other 
 I'm a pray for him 
 It's safe to say, he got some pain within 
 It ain't too much that I can say to him 
 Cause my bank statement don't relate to him 
 We ain't supposed to never have nothing 
 We ain't supposed to never have shit 
 See the growth in my rhymes 
 See my focus ain't on them 
 I was so fresh, so clean when I stepped on that scene 
 Pulled up Aston Martin, you could ask them y'all seen 
 When I came through this bitch 
 Paper tagging on lean 
 Baddest bitch in the game 
 Nigga that was y'all dream 
 Hold up, let me get a feel 
 Like Jack say hold up 
 I don't feel these niggas, nah 
 Hey Wallace 
 Yap, what's the problem? I'm focused 
 I'm Kobe, I kill these niggas 
 I ain't scared of these niggas 
 Getting higher than Shaquille O'Neal 
 Field Goal Percentage 
 Yeah me nigga 
 Till the brokest nigga with got a mill plus interest 
 Meek keep living 
 Get em 
 When I was dead broke used to always tell myself I'mma still be the shit 
 Till my P.O she locked me up 
 I'mma do the time come home and still be this rich 
 Still see the bricks, I'mma still be a Mitch 
 Got these RICO shit tryna kill me and shit 
 Hol' up, tryna kill me and shit 
 Let me get the flow back, I was killing this shit 
 We was killing them strips, drop heads - no ceiling shit 
 Ain't talking 'bout Wayne, bitch I'm talking them things 
 300 and change got a million in whips 
 Nigga 
 We ain't supposed to never have nothing 
 We ain't supposed to never have shit 
 See the growth in my rhymes 
 See my focus ain't on them 
 Started from the bottom nigga 
 But now we grinding till the law come get us 
 For the money and them commas nigga 
 But can't forget about vagina nigga 
 Started from that bottom nigga 
 But now I got it it's a problem nigga 
 For that money and them dollars nigga 
 And I ain't rich but I'm still shining nigga 
 I'm still shining nigga

 Shining nigga 
 We still shining nigga

 We still shining nigga 
 Shining nigga 
 Let me shine my nigga
