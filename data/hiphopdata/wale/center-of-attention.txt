I call a spade a spade 
 What you want me to say? 
 Say I'm destined for fame, well I am very afraid 
 Do you know what fame is? 
 If you did, you wouldn't want to be famous 
 Everybody finger, pointing your direction 
 Everybody seems to misread every sentence 
 Better or worse, the center of attention 
 Gift and a curse, the center of attention 
 See I wouldn't wish success on my worst foe 
 You see the devil is alive but he work slow 
 And yeah I should've seen the signs by my first quote 
 Before you sign, you'll be blind if you've been broke 
 And true I've seen better times because I'm getting dough 
 But my vision has declined since I'm Interscope, and it's home 
 This country has an obsession with celebrity 
 But who is to blame when we let them in on everything? 
 From B's wedding ring, to beef meddling 
 Ironic we on air, but they never let us breathe 
 We all make mistakes, why you want to make an issue? 
 If I don't diss another nigga you don't get that issue 
 I don't really get you, see what the problem is 
 Keeping up with Khloe and Kim, not the Obama'ses 
 You trying to find out where Rihanna is 
 To be honest you ain't minding where Osama is 
 And it's not a big deal, it's a small affair 
 Fuck Barack's change, we'd rather talk Milian's hair 
 And if the sky fall tonight, we all be all right 
 Just tell us where all the stars is 
 Nah, I wouldn't wish fame on my enemy 
 Paparazzi like a life time sentencing 
 No comma, no pause, no anything 
 Just know fame has a price, lose everything 
 DC has never seen such progress 
 So bitches on the scene seem quite stalkish 
 They like talking, it's like gossip 
 How little hugs can turn to draws offered 
 Though uncalled for, they going to drop them 
 And your girl's cousins trying to get her other options 
 And now your best friend's having kids 
 They two now, I haven't seen they godfather yet 
 Don't let me talk about the deal ones 
 Mommy found out, I'm paying everybody's bills 
 B.I.G. said it more money, more ills 
 So I spend it real fast, because I'm trying to sit and chill 
 A little, signed, sealed, delivered 
 Before a nigga signed I had a healthier liver 
 Shit, now my lips liquor, wish 
 As my record label nit-picks at this
