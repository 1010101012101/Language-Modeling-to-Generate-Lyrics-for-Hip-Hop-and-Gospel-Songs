(Chorus - Melanie Fiona and Wale) 
 Babe you know it gets no better than this 
 It's like, sunshine on a rainy day 
 It's like a high, could you take me away 
 Take me away, away. It's a beautiful bliss 
 When you feel like this (beautiful bliss) 
 When you spill out hits (beautiful bliss) 
 When you fly as a bitch 
 And you ride with tints 
 And you ain't bothered a bit now baby 
 (Verse 1 - Wale) 
 Fresh out the airport 
 Fresh out the chair with the clippers 
 Like Sean living, thinking, hmm 
 I'm trying to get it like Sean get it 
 If lord giveth a mill and a milf light skinded 
 A slight blemishes and life system 
 But I'm giving it foundation when I write lyric 
 That anvil night hard minus bright knickers 
 Maybe not quite the star but my hearts in it 
 When Bret Hart meet Brett Favre 
 A sharp shooter well exceeding any figure four 
 You see my figure more or less stick some more 
 On your vest then my larynx and lungs and this voice I project 
 My project is like what pros inject 
 And niggas so fly I should be droved in jets 
 Its ironic they call me a fresh breath no joke 
 You see dem boys sign me to the scope right 
 (Chorus - Melanie Fiona and Wale) 
 (Verse 2 - J.Cole) 
 I phone home to the real they wanna know just how it feel 
 Who woulda thought a lil nigga from the ville could get a deal 
 And tell dem niggas at the top we want your spot we are for real 
 And yet we heard you got it locked but like dem socks we on your heels 
 So you best be on your toes nigga 
 Especially on your flows nigga 
 Cause man they keep on checking for me especially all your hoes nigga 
 Catch me on your doorstep you see me let me in 
 All I wanna do is eat I'm like a freaky lesbian 
 Now all I wanna do ball on TV knee E S P N 
 They heard I'm bout to blow so all my enemies say lets be friends 
 And all these rappers know just where I'm bout to go so catch me then 
 Where all the girls we knew that scream "fuck you" 
 Gon let me in, I'm definiately in a class of my own 
 At dinner with HOV hoping that he pass the baton 
 He just pass the patron 
 Ain't nothing given dog its earned if you just living dog you learn 
 I let you niggas see the light I'm like the prison yard I yearn 
 For that living large but mama I ain't done yet 
 Sit back and watch your son rise 
 Kick back and know your son set 
 Forever I ain't run yet and never will 
 Nas told me lifes a bitch 
 Pac said fuck the world and I ain't come yet 
 You up yet? 
 My punchlines like gut checks I'm raw dog 
 I'm rough sex I'm on deck I'm up next 
 I'm godbless I'm success so fuck stress 
 You can get the fuck from round me 
 And if you listening know you wondering 
 Where the fuck they found me 
 I'm from the ville boy 
 Hey Wale... good lookin' 
 (Chorus - Melanie Fiona and Wale) 
 (Verse 3 - Wale) 
 Another day up in my ES 
 Wish it was an LS 
 But elastic is my wallet, fuck it 
 I don't be stressed like relaxed... muscles 
 Your feedback ain't flexing 
 And you can keep it running, like a muffler 
 When we not in summer 
 They like A list actors they not no stunners 
 Too much practice now for me to malfunction 
 So any beat that function I breathe on and puncture 
 Leave it like a female Dijon a puncture 
 Waiting showing you her beauty if she's naked 
 It's like a view of paintin or a lakehead 
 This just how beautiful my day is 
 Peep me how I'm raising up the capital for Nathan 
 Capital I'm raising like I'm through punctuating 
 Or shift keys or an I placement cause 
 Shift the keys get your capital raised up 
 (Chorus - Melanie Fiona and Wale)
