Look, 
 I just wanna make you better 
 I think I can save you, but I think I'm bi-polar 
 I love you, then I hate you 
 Crew from this dame, 
 I hate whoever ain't you 
 Hate when I can't date you, 
 But I also need my space too 
 I made room for this love, how foolish of me. 
 And every woman lookin' at you, knew that you was lucky 
 So check the verse miss, 
 I ain't say I'm perfect, 
 But you was low on love, 
 What I do, reimbursed it. 
 And now it hurts to be around or converse witcha 
 And what's worse is before this, I had worse witcha 
 Now war missiles, hand guns, and grenades. 
 The walls I couldn't break 'em, I take 'em apart would would attain 
 And momma told me, careful who ya love 
 She said just wrap it up 
 These bitches actin' up 
 As for us, we was different tho 
 Things have gotten difficult 
 Tried to be Mr. Perfect, 
 Enter continental, hold up 
 You spend your time wit your friends all the time 
 And all that time wit your friends 
 Put my momentum on decline 
 My minds gone evil 
 You changed wit the season 
 You had a new clear heart 
 Your sours hit Roshima 
 So now I need some zany, some remy, and some reefa 
 So when this war is over, I'm not P-T-S'd in 
 And I don't wanna leave her, 
 But you know what got me wonderin' 
 I'm scared to lose love, but even more scared to love again 
 Why we gotta argue, 
 Why we fight 
 I just wanna love you, 
 I wanna make it right 
 It's like we both forgot what we were fighting for 
 So tell why are we at war 
 Yeah 
 They do (whatever they want) 
 And nobody else can stop it 
 I'm catchin' myself depositing these feelings she withdraw from 
 And I ain't got the guard to tell my guards "la- bye-bye" 
 From hurtin', 
 My effort is apparent, she not fertile 
 The anger I've adopted 
 The feelings been aborted 
 So now, I press ignore if ever Cupid try to call up 
 They call me better not 
 See when everything stop 
 And your love's an honest sight, 
 And you see everything it's not 
 Notice everything it wasn't 
 Realizing why it shouldn't never be again 
 'Cause in the end it's not about what you put in 
 Fuck is the huggin' and they love pushin' your buttons 
 New love is so beautiful, time just makes it ugly 
 But fuck it, I accept it 
 No longer when neglected 
 If a period is right there, I will mark it wit a question 
 That means I'll never trust them 
 And if you ever love 'em 
 Know that favorite girlfriends turn to crazy baby mothers 
 The War. 
 Why we gotta argue, 
 Why we fight 
 I just wanna love you, 
 I wanna make it right 
 It's like we both forgot what we were fighting for 
 So baby why are we at war
