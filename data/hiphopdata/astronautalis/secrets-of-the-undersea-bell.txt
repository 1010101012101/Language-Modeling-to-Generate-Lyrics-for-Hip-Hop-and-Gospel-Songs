Every old salt knows a song to sing 
 When things go wrong, and things go wrong, 
 They can resurrect men with mighty hymns 
 Cannot raise the diving bell 
 With their hands cut open and the line unweaving 
 Sea swells like the ribcage of lions breathing 
 They pulled till you swore that the rope was bleeding 
 Ichor poured from the palms of gods and heathens 
 When their bell dipped down in the Stygian deep 
 And they know many omens are spoken evil 
 But those poor souls that know that awful feeling 
 They're dancing like their lantern candles 
 Every old salt knows a song to sing 
 When things go wrong, and things go wrong 
 They can resurrect men with mighty hymns 
 Cannot raise the diving bell 
 Cannot raise the diving bell 
 Cannot raise the diving bell 
 Well the sanguine sun set on the evening 
 In the sea like glass that was far too peaceful 
 Though the line ran tight to the bell beneath it 
 In heaven is where the devil always hides his secrets 
 Let me teach you songs that will fare you well 
 Let me draw you maps through the gates of Hell 
 Who would kill those men on one can tell 
 The secrets of the diving bell 
 The secrets of the diving bell 
 The secrets of the diving bell 
 Every old salt knows a song to sing 
 When things go wrong, and things go wrong 
 They can resurrect men with mighty hymns 
 Cannot raise the diving bell 
 Every old salt knows a song to sing 
 When winds are gone, and winds are gone 
 You can fill flat sails with the salty strings 
 Cannot raise the diving bell 
 Cannot raise the diving bell 
 Cannot raise the diving bell
