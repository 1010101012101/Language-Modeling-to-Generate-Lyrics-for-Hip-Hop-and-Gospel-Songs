Two years spent before the mast 
 And no one knows the secrets that we're hiding 
 If word got loose, you'd face the lash 
 And thirteen loops would hold me fast and silent 
 Things are not always as they seem to be 
 Outside us 
 Devil got poor Persephone 
 But they can't take 
 They can't take you from me 
 They can't take you from me 
 Can't take you from me 
 Can't take you from me 
 Mr. Jones done made a mistake, it's all business 
 There's worse thing than the watery grave with Poricthys 
 I found her behind a barrel of grain in the hold, listless 
 A hollow, half-hearted, dismayed, frayed princess 
 I guess I've gone soft in my age, they call it instinct 
 The rebels get the devil to pay her, the cat hissing 
 Gonna start, I know I oughta send her to the brig 
 But strongest, not scared, and still bothered with calm winds 
 And all things aren't what they seem to be and 
 Small walls separating Earth from Eden 
 One rib did give Eve a meaning 
 And one snip might could keep a secret 
 With the short hair there and a change of clothing 
 Fit right in and work soak and oakum 
 Four fortnights she'll annul with the opium 
 I might slip by, but for her and bosun 
 Two years spent before the mast 
 And no one knows the secrets that we're hiding 
 If word got loose, you'd face the lash 
 And thirteen loops would hold me fast and silent 
 Things are not always as they seem to be 
 Outside us 
 Devil got poor Persephone 
 But they can't take 
 They can't take you from me 
 Clip of the shears 
 Twist of her hair 
 To the air, handsomely 
 Till it floated down among the clouds 
 Reflected on the glassy sea 
 And the winds disappear 
 Stripped almost bare 
 Bathed in a transfixed state 
 And all things are what they seem to be 
 She floated next to me 
 Just out of reach 
 There is no knot so steadfast 
 It won't go broke in the middle of monsoons 
 Your hope don't show, waiting, watching 
 With wet lips, your clothes soaked through 
 Blinded mine to the red sky and oxide clouds 
 Living just as a plasmid amidst lines and booms 
 Coupled up with abstinence and stolen looks 
 We broke our pledge against the bulkhead as the world pitched 
 Pulled to your shit with soft needs and the soap stone 
 Now Mr. Jones is the poor soul who walked into a tempest 
 And this time two poor fools 
 Give them a whipping and head sail quirks quick lose 
 The best men can end when the storm rolls through 
 So we paid our keep 
 For the sin of a reckless dream 
 In the seam where secrets sleep 
 Between me, her, the Devil and the deep blue sea 
 Two years spent before the mast 
 And no one knows the secrets that we're hiding 
 If word got loose, you'd face the lash 
 And thirteen loops would hold me fast and silent 
 Things are not always as they seem to be 
 Outside us 
 Devil got poor Persephone 
 But they can't take 
 They can't take you from me 
 They can't take you from me 
 Can't take you from me 
 Can't take you from me
