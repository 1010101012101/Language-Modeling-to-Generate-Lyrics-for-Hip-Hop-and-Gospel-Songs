Dreamed up the maps 
 Give me the charcoal and the paper now 
 We invent paths they cannot see 
 They're too scared to walk 
 Between my hands rest 52 
 Plain old playing cards 
 And I trapped God somewhere between 
 Trump and the king of hearts 
 Joni Mitchell said, 
 "We are stardust, we are golden." 
 We are all the same 
 Blood paints the story of our love 
 Across the bathroom floor, towards the drain 
 Funny how everything just piles up 
 Until one day you can't believe how far you came 
 I'm made of mountains, made of metal 
 Made of whiskey and waves 
 Won't believe your own breath 
 When the bold words finally escape your mouth 
 Keep your secrets hidden 
 Until you're certain of just what we've found 
 Yeah, they bleed just like us 
 But our calling, is what shapes us now 
 Won't be held back, won't be tied up 
 Won't be pinned down 
 Won't be held back, won't be tied up, won't be pinned down 
 Won't be held back, won't be tied up, won't be pinned down 
 Won't be held back, won't be tied up, won't be pinned down 
 Won't be held back, won't be, not now

 Between my hands rest 52 
 Plain old playing cards 
 And I trapped God somewhere between 
 Trump and the king of hearts 
 Trump and the king of hearts 
 Trump and the king of hearts 
 Trump and the king of, trump and the king of 
 Trump and the king of hearts 
 Trump and the king of hearts 
 Trump and the king of hearts 
 Trump and the king of, trump and the king of 
 Trump and the king of hearts 
 It came to me, as strange as it seems 
 From a simple deck of cards, laid ace to kings 
 My fingernail slipped under King Charlemagne 
 I flipped the edge and traced the grain and watched it fall like a breaking wave 
 The ace of spades, last to splash 
 Trump to suicide kings, they all turned Bicycle backs 
 Stared at the pattern, a pair of seraphim flashed 
 And it just fit, elegant, "aww shit", that's that 
 Strange you can waste away pain with one thing 
 Watchmaker breaks sweat, he can't tame a dumb spring 
 And one day it's as plain as the nose, above your smug grin 
 Like, "look what the cat dragged in" 
 Woke from a dream, hands heavy in cold sweat 
 Jumped from the bed, snatched the charcoal quick 
 Sketching frantically upon the bedroom brick 
 Came together and it fit, like this: 
 "Give me a lever and a place to stand 
 And I'll move the world" 
 You think you're clever 
 But you've never seen how it really works 
 Really works, really works 
 Really works, really works 
 Really works, really works 
 Really works, oh no

 Trump and the king of hearts 
 Trump and the king of hearts 
 Trump and the king of hearts 
 Trump and the king of, trump and the king of 
 Trump and the king of hearts 
 Trump and the king of hearts 
 Trump and the king of hearts 
 Trump and the king of, trump and the king of 
 Trump and the king of hearts
