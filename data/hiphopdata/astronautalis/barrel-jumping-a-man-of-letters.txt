Well, sometimes 
 I think that you meet someone 
 You give and you give 
 And you give until there's nothing left 
 No matter what 
 it's never ever going to be good enough for them 
 Drove up to the river with the barrel in the back of the trunk 
 The grilled cheese that Karen moonlit hit, let's hang out in front 
 Mr. Moon and Johnny Cash swear I'm leaving at once 
 Punched the gas the leaves all laugh 
 The wind wheezes and coughs 
 The water wash sprays off, pinpricked my lips 
 Wet wood framed moonlight, barely barrel of slits 
 Came too far to watch it drift off now I can 
 Let my ship slide along right off the cliff 
 Right off the cliff 
 Right off the cliff 
 Could have set you to rest 
 I could have told you that I loved you to death 
 Make a million memories, you talk in wasted breath 
 Wave my hat and beat my chest while listening till it hits 
 You love the mess, I'll give you one that you never forget 
 A man of letters knows the best of broken needs and frayed respects 
 The promise catch a cloud of breath and foggy humid scent 
 The hands that get and hands that beg and hands that always forget 
 Count on tips but never ever can you count on the catch 
 Count on the catch 
 Count on the catch 
 My little ship drifts with the leaves and water spraying 'cross the lips 
 Mr. Moon's good work blue earthmen kissed 
 Two ships soft hiss in the sparkling mist 
 That old lift in your falling chest just before the hit 
 I never thought it'd come to this my parents never taught me to drift 
 Something I learned watching bridges burn down to sticks 
 There's nothing left but a mess of splinters flailing limbs 
 The water sounds just like the record's end 
 Just like the record's end 
 Just like the record's end 
 There's no big bang, there's no big mess 
 There's no big parade, no big cheques 
 There's no big bang, there's no big mess 
 There's no big parade, no big cheques 
 There's no big bang, there's no big mess 
 There's no big parade, no big cheques 
 There's no big bang, there's no big mess 
 There's no big parade, no big cheques 
 There's no big bang, there's no big mess 
 There's no big parade, no big cheques 
 There's no big bang, there's no big mess 
 There's no big parade, no big cheques 
 There's no big bang, there's no big mess 
 There's no big bang, there's no big mess 
 There's no big bang, there's no big mess 
 There's no big bang, there's no big mess 
 There's no big bang, there's no...
