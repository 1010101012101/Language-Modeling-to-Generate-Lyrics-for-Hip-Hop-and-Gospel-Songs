Diamonds is gold 
 And the ocean is a lake 
 That mountain's just a hill 
 Those buildings are fake 
 Water tastes like pennies 
 Christmas tastes like June 
 The city tastes like gasoline 
 And the lies all taste like truth 
 He ain't your lover 
 He ain't your friend 
 That scarecrow's not your father 
 Them cars ain't the wind 
 Oh lord, how you shine to me 
 Oh god, how you glow to me 
 My fortune is made of nickels 
 Kings are shaking dimes 
 In their pockets as they stalk the alleys waiting for their time 
 The wars are fought for silent trophies 
 And ladies fake the news 
 Caking up their cold sores while the cleaner steals my suit 
 You can't count on taxes 
 Buddy, death is up and gone 
 Left us hear to fade away 
 Sing our wrinkled songs 
 Oh lord how you shine to me 
 Oh god how you glow to me 
 Oh lord how she shines to me 
 Oh god how she glows to me
