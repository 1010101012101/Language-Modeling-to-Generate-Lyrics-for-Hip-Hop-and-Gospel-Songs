Baby, tell me anything that you please 
 I'll take it all with a grain of salt 
 I know exactly why you're calling me 
 I don't even need to hear you talk 
 Daddy told me always watch my feet 
 When walking where the weeds grow too tall 
 And I can tell that you're lying to me 
 By the fork at the end of your tongue 
 The end of your tongue 
 I been up all night waiting for you to come home 
 Come up with a good reason 
 I been up all night knowing you gone and done wrong 
 I know you're lying 'cause you're speaking 
 Go on keep on praying to your God above 
 He knows the Devil when he sees him 
 He only putting bills in your ol' swear jar 
 He won't buy you no freedom 
 Careful brother the grass grows awful high here 
 Ain't no telling what's dwelling or hides near 
 The former felon don't always appear in Nike Airs 
 With right eye that might cry only tattoo tears 
 Now, real killers don't kick down doors 
 The dangerous ones are ones you invite in your own home 
 So while you busy blowing and chanting 
 Turn around clown the nightgown of the serpent is waiting 
 She got you in a death hold that won't let go 
 And you're quick to thank her 
 Stiletto ain't just a shoe but a knife it is dangerous 
 Brother, I bet you you just slow 
 And you think you can change it 
 But a snake is still a snake even if it shed its skin daily 
 I know you listening lady 
 Yeah, you been keeping tabs on me lately 
 Crawled out your rock the moment I made it 
 With apologetic talk, Obama promising changes 
 I been up all night waiting for you to come home 
 Come up with a good reason 
 I been up all night knowing you gone and done wrong 
 I know you're lying 'cause you're speaking 
 Go on keep on praying to your God above 
 He knows the Devil when he sees him 
 He only putting bills in your ol' swear jar 
 He won't buy you no freedom
