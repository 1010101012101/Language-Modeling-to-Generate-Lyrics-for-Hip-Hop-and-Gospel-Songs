There's forest fire up in the hills again 
 Always reminds me of the night we spent at the river's edge for hours 
 Standing hand in hand 
 Too chicken shit to just go dive in it 
 Too scared to turn away and face the fate that awaits us both back on land 
 Forest fire has a smell to it 
 A certain sweetness that misleads us 
 To believe that anything's well again 
 Summer sweltering 
 The kind of heat you feel inside your feet 
 Radiating upward from the earth within 
 If I was a smarter man I'da never gave you mama's wedding ring 
 I'da went ahead and just pawned the thing 
 Skipped town and never called again 
 But your brain never listens to the songs that your heart'll sing 
 I ain't no Christian that was mama's thing 
 I don't know how to pray 
 And if I did I'm not too sure he's listening 
 To me it's whispering 
 I don't know 
 Maybe there is some fucking magic in giving language to hidden things 
 Who are we kidding kid? We were just pulled into this 
 And what the hell would make us think that we were any different 
 Your daddy did the same my pops did it too 
 They came to the same spot asking that river for some clues 
 All they got was wet shoes 
 And they gave birth to me and you 
 So tell me darling 
 What the hell are we supposed to do? 
 Dance alone together 
 Held back by the fear that one day 
 We might get so close 
 Never be strong enough to separate 
 She had this dream that's clever 
 We could fold time and space 
 I like you, you like me 
 Why are we so afraid? 
 Why are we so afraid? 
 Why are we so afraid? 
 Why are we so afraid? 
 Why are we so afraid? 
 Why are we so afraid? 
 Why are we so afraid?
