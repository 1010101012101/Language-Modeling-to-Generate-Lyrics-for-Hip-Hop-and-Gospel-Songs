A sliver of chalk across the blue 
 Lord knows I don't know what the hell's the use of the midday moon 
 You came to my arms too goddamn soon 
 Lord knows I don't know what to do with you and the midday moon 
 This is just to say 
 They've taken everything away 
 Every step we made fit into six trucks 
 Pick-ups drawing dust above the driveway 
 The muddy cavalcade came at half past eight 
 Collecting everything in that grassy bank 
 And every trace of you was taken too 
 And what was once a womb is just a hollow room 
 It was a windy day 
 That kind that makes me hate L.A. 
 'Cause God gave them a perfect sun 
 And they think gangs and smog were hardly a fair trade 
 They don't breathe or flinch 
 Or even blink at how the green will shift 
 When the wind parades across the meager ridge 
 And kicks the weeds a bit to make seem as if the lea is a sea of waves 
 They say you can't cheat death 
 Maybe it's just a shortness of breath 
 Or no pains in your chest 
 A disease we agree that we ain't cured yet 
 Forgive me dear 
 I never thought that we'd end up here 
 From 
 "sweet dreams" 
 whispered in your ear 
 Before a long night's sleep so cold and clear 
 A sliver of chalk across the blue 
 Lord knows I don't know what the hell's the use of the midday moon 
 You came to my arms too goddamn soon 
 Lord knows I don't know what to do with you and the midday moon 
 I've been told that when we die we pass onto the other side 
 there's no bright light, no bright light. 
 Death is just a pasture gate that opens by lifting a plank 
 To just more life, just more life 
 I met an old man, sun-tanned, provided by Jesus 
 And the light that passed through stain glassed pieces 
 He clutched a rosary flat to his chest 
 And confessed he wasn't ready for death 
 I seen an iron eyed firefly, femme fatale 
 Too vain to explain how her hair fell out 
 Lusting for the next thing to erase her shame 
 She doesn't want to live forever, but she's scared to fade away 
 This is how they came to me, one at a time 
 Pilgrims to my building on the cemetery ground 
 All they wanted was an answer and I could never let 'em down 
 I couldn't promise them forever but I could buy a lot of time 
 You Jeanvieve, you were the straw 
 Whispering your wishes in cotton Quebeois 
 I wonder if the Maker ever felt he botched the flock 
 But never had the mettle to make the world stop 
 Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop 
 I wonder if the maker ever felt he botched the flock 
 But never had the mettle to make the world stop 
 Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop 
 I wonder if the maker ever felt he botched the flock 
 But never had the mettle to make the world stop 
 Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop 
 Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
