Everyone who's drinking is already drunk or sleeping 
 Everyone who isn't is just too political to talk to 
 Another summer evening and the city's barely breathing 
 It just ain't the same, just ain't the same without you 
 Without you, without you, without you 
 Without you, without you 
 It just ain't the same, just ain't the same 
 There ain't no magic in materials, the magic's in our words 
 That we whisper in each others ears to make diamonds outta dirt 
 There ain't glory in the silken things, the glory's in the hurt 
 That can split your skin from end to end, down the center of the earth 
 I said everyone who's drinking is already drunk or sleeping 
 Everyone who isn't is just too political to talk to 
 Another summer evening and the city's barely breathing 
 It just ain't the same, just ain't the same without you 
 I wasn't joking 'bout my burial, the backyard's where I prefer 
 But my landlord wouldn't like that, I gotta own a backyard first 
 So I'll keep singing y'all these spirituals and pray it lifts the curse 
 That keeps me chasing ghosts of dreams from funerals to birth in reverse 
 In reverse, in reverse, in reverse 
 In reverse, in reverse 
 That keeps me chasing ghosts of dreams from funerals to birth 
 In reverse 
 Everyone who's drinking is already drunk or sleeping 
 Everyone who isn't is just too political to talk to 
 Another summer evening and the city's barely breathing 
 It just ain't the same, just ain't the same without you 
 Without you, without you, without you 
 Without you, without you 
 It just ain't the same, just ain't the same 
 Without you
