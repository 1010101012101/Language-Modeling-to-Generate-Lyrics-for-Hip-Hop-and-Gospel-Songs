I'm calling out to all the famous clowns and bums 
 I'm sneakin' out, peakin' in your windows 
 Watchin' you kiss the screen 
 Lovin' them, like I hope they love me 
 I'm calling out to all the famous clowns and bums 
 I'm sneakin' out, peepin' inside your homes 
 Watchin' you, watch them split they seams 
 Lovin' them, like I hope they love me 
 I'm calling out to all the famous clowns and bums 
 I'm sneakin' out, peakin' in your windows 
 Watchin' you kiss the screen 
 Lovin' them, like I hope they love me 
 I'm calling out to all the famous clowns and bums 
 I'm sneakin' out, peepin' in your homes 
 Watchin' you, watch them split they seams 
 Lovin' them, like I hope they love me 
 It's the return of the ghost, the raising of the dead 
 And the cloning approach shadows stick the foot of your bed 
 With windy notes, so fog the window with breath 
 I drag my footprints through your grass and all across your garden 
 I never know just what's to be said 
 It's so close to the wall, the cars'll get hit 
 So spell it out in the fog in the window pane 
 Written backwards at your expense for everyone else's gain 
 It's hard tonight but it's comin' in clear 
 You called 'em right? They comin' here 
 They got the couch and he's got the chair 
 I got the flower beds, some sweaty palms, a couple dumb ideas 
 Praying hearts and minds stuck in discovery's fears 
 I've been alive in little bursts 
 It's the little bits of life that hurt 
 The way to write's been across the dirt 
 The sunpots seen behind you work 
 The ball of kindness is shipping the bird 
 Toss in smiling, call him first 
 It covers up the best and hurts the worst 
 The freckles are suddenly painted across your shoulder blades 
 The biggest hit to come across the space 
 The calling and the fall of all who wait 
 The fingerprints and window glass 
 The funny women's superstitious afraid of cats 
 Dumbest feeling, the embarrassment that puts us on our ass 
 Looking back, then moving on 
 The stupid songs, the foolish ones 
 Reminds the signs the brightest lies 
 The Broadway clip that turns the gate 
 Broke hold but don't get close kids 
 Turns out it's understood, it's time to miss 
 I'm calling out to all the famous clowns and bums 
 I'm sneakin' out, peakin' in your windows 
 Watchin' you kiss the screen 
 Lovin' you, like I hope you love me 
 I'm calling out to all the famous clowns and bums 
 I'm sneakin' out, peepin' inside your homes 
 Watchin' you, watch them split they seams 
 Lovin' them, like I hope they love me 
 I'm calling out to all the famous clowns and bums 
 I'm sneakin' out, peakin' in your windows 
 I'm calling out to all the famous clowns and bums 
 I'm sneakin' out, peepin' inside your homes 
 I'm calling out to all the famous clowns and bums 
 I'm sneakin' out, peakin' in your windows 
 Watchin' you, watch them split they seams 
 Lovin' them, like I hope they love me 
 The sun came in over on the building 
 Rich and 56 feet below, a Dominican charges path to death run pain stained block 
 While the chief turns on his radio and cracks his steel Reserve 
 I wonder how many of last night's lovers double parked 
 This city swallows men 
 He tells me tales of places that he ran, eventually ran from 
 Never to return again 
 It's funny in luck and love 
 You can never remember the moment that you fell in 
 Or recall when you fell out of touch 
 The city's hushed, keepin' it's secrets 
 The sunshine is gliding, riding, hiding wrinkles and creases, beautiful features 
 Chipped, cracked, crippled and weakened 
 Tragic pageant queen bleeds soft focus, keepin' her even 
 The city's breathing, feel it coming awake 
 Every explanation creates a gray across the sky scrape 
 Like the sky's a looking glass and the fog, the dirty breath left 
 We can etch our dreams and wipe it clean before they see 
 It's city's rushing, picking up a bitter steam 
 The Chief's beat his shift till first sip 
 A malt liquor will bleed to lips 
 He flips a small piece of shit 
 Driver's license, a money clip 
 And shows it off everything equipped 
 With a face like, "Look what I did..." 
 City's up in arms, the Chief is ravin' 
 Sick of taxes, sick of workin' 
 Sick of waitin', sick and tired of what the city's facin' 
 Enlisting ladies chased from the bottom of his history's basement 
 A tomb of her own, a room caked in cobwebs, odd and ends and vases 
 This city's built ahead of steam, the river shivers steadily 
 The poison boilin' up from beneath the lies and memories 
 I spent the last three months in shambles 
 Drunk on clouds and siphoned stars 
 I shook every palm left-handed 
 Those offered inside the back of a bar 
 Woke in a party with streamers tossed inside my hair 
 My head's been ringin' loud 
 A cigarette burns out inside my left hand 
 And dust the cane and bottle cacophony off of me standing 
 And blow a kiss to my chair 
 Unlock the deadbolt baby, I'm comin' home 
 Or you'll never see my face around here 
 You'll never see my face around here 
 You'll never see my face again 
 The patient changes and takes his place 
 Now I need strength now that all my rap friends have settled down 
 Fingertips and sand pockets put a stone in here and 
 All I can come up with the same news is bad news from this old town 
 It's all I have what a beautiful piece of rotten luck 
 You don't own the right to pay for my kisses and backwater dreams 
 So, sneakin' my hands across your shoulder blades 
 Won't you fall into my arms and fall into the eaves 
 And fall asleep while the city grinds its teeth 
 Do the bottle race, hold me fast, boot strap 
 The moves are holding us to the earth 
 With your eyes shut tight, anyone can be king 
 We're in projectors, steal concessions, like the picture was blurred 
 We face the days that we can't see, we run and we fall 
 We hate this place, but we can't leave, so what do we call it 
 Now it's cornered by the cat's calls and situated walls 
 And the error message says, "You son of a bitch. You hated in love?" 
 Facing the sun centers away from a soft shoe, dreams of tap dance 
 Hangover a headache aversion to civility, turning to beach 
 Arm in arm live in old frames before the kids kiss in 
 Gasoline tombs and cocaine 
 I know it's slow, James, strips malls insane 
 With a fresh coat of paint and more fucking fast food chains 
 But it's okay, my feet are still fine 
 The sun's still burning, blurry lines till I can still see in the sky 
 Leaving me blind, staggering from the scene to the street to the streams 
 that lead to the east to feed the machines that leave us in peace 
 Soon as they receive their load, sing a song of St. Johns 
 And sail alone around the rest of the globe 
 And sail alone doing Knight Rider past your house 
 Start laughing about driving dragons and passing out 
 Private pageants cash and clowns, bursts of laughing out 
 Down and out in the bold new city of the south
