William holds his palm out proud 
 Upon the Bible, lays it down 
 And solemnly swears against it 
 That every word is true 
 Searching through the faceless crowd 
 In the hallowed auditorium 
 He sees that everyone is turned against him 
 And his endless pursuit 
 The saga that he spells out 
 Has mothers grabbing children 
 Grown men twisting mustaches 
 As priests smooth out their suits 
 But William hammers right along 
 And ignores the banging gavel of 
 The judges plea for order 
 In the chaos of the room 
 Outside my cell 
 There is an oak that grows 
 Through the fence line 
 And towards the sun 
 They built a barrier of barbs 
 Flush butted against its bark 
 And still its burls unfurled 
 Into branches strong 
 The silver thorns that hem in my hole 
 Snare me here through sun and snow 
 While barbs may scar 
 They cannot stop the mighty oak 
 Burgeoning upward and out 
 Disfigured no doubt 
 The persistent sapling made stout 
 By its daggered escape route 
 Once it finally stands tall 
 Its limbs will make the fence fall 
 The slowest getaway car 
 That the guard ever saw 
 The warden scratches his bald patches 
 And raises arms in the air 
 He wonders how this happened 
 Despite decades to prepare 
 In this I found the faith 
 That you'd see my sentence a mistake 
 Discharge me from this place 
 And reinstate me in your grace 
 The truth will set you free one day 
 My Father promised me 
 But I'd never thought 
 The truth would come this way, quite honestly 
 William holds his palm out proud 
 Upon the Bible, lays it down 
 And solemnly swear against it 
 That every word is true 
 Searching through the faceless crowd 
 In the hallowed auditorium 
 He sees that everyone is turned against him 
 And his endless pursuit 
 If you had told me back then 
 That the words from my pen 
 Would've branded me a paynim 
 I would never changed a damn thing 
 I am sure it's shocking to your ears 
 That the treaties you revere 
 Would suffer such assessment 
 At the stylus of confr√©re 
 But I am more than well aware 
 How you all were unprepared 
 To stare into the sun 
 As it means to pick apart its flares 
 With my covenant in question 
 And career upon the line 
 I will suffer your reckless sanctions 
 With the clarity of mind 
 That the charges that you lay 
 Against my character of faith 
 Will burden you with shame 
 When you face the presumed paradise 
 And He knows, well as I 
 That His heralds can carol flat songs 
 The refrains ring familiar 
 But the words just seem a tad wrong 
 God is just a breath away 
 He lives a kiss from your lips 
 But his message can mutate 
 As it drifts from mount to chisel tips 
 So this is it 
 My suffrage sings its swan song 
 Your suspicions set me sovereign 
 From the restriction of your sad bonds 
 While you edit me from existence 
 For continuity 
 May the Lord be always in your footsteps 
 To document your lunacy 
 William holds his palm out proud 
 Upon the Bible, lays it down 
 And solemnly swears against it 
 That every word is true

 And his endless pursuit 
 The saga that he spells out 
 Has mothers grabbing children 
 Grown men twisting mustaches 
 As priests smooth out their suits 
 But William hammers right along 
 And ignores the banging gavel of 
 The judges plea for order
