I know, leaving's your living, built in your bones 
 No one can ever escape all of their ghosts 
 So if you walk, you better learn how to run 
 That's why I wrote this song 
 Your contrail's coated in broken homes 
 You polished up this pretty pearl of a hope 
 That I won't parade your skeletons for everyone 
 That's why I wrote this song 
 That's why I wrote this song (that's why I wrote this song) 
 That's why I wrote this song (that's why I wrote this song) 
 That's why I wrote this song (that's why I wrote this song) 
 I know you know the words, so sing along 
 She always made the best of deaf and blind 
 Fashionable dress of canes and signs 
 Tracing their apparel, like a judge of character in Braille 
 She never missed a lift, a bump or a line 
 But fingertips will drift and miss blip from time to time 
 And this is how we find 
 Secrets that slipped our grip 
 Over wit and charm on whispered breath 
 Frantically fishing for familiarness on fingertips 
 And this is just, shit, what is this? 
 This is redress 
 I know her cane is just a comedy 
 Tin cup's a crutch for crippled honesty 
 Her slain perception's lame deception 
 What's astonishing, we bought it, see 
 Every Harry, Dick, and Tom, left her very fickle palms 
 Palming a broken promise ring, you follow me? 
 A hundred strong men choked on a bit 
 While the blind bride guides the bridle toward the abyss 
 And this can only end wrong 
 But motherfuck it, that's the reason why I wrote this song 
 I know leaving's your living, built in your bones 
 No one can ever escape all of their ghosts 
 So if you walk, you better learn how to run 
 That's why I wrote this song 
 Your contrail's coated in broken homes 
 You polished up this pretty pearl of a hope 
 That I won't parade your skeletons for everyone 
 That's why I wrote this song 
 Lionel Terray said it the truest, I set it to music 
 We're all "Conquistadors of the Useless" 
 What kind of fool is so stupid to climb a mountain to do it 
 Then climb back down to the town without a picture to prove it? 
 I knew it 
 From the moment I saw your eyes flash wide in the crowd 
 That you would cut and run, it's too late to turn back now 
 It's when those burnt black clouds submerge the Earth in shroud 
 That kings earn that crown 
 And this is how we rise by taking a fall 
 Survive another winter on straight to the thaw 
 One day you'll learn to strain the tea through your teeth 
 And maybe find the strength to proceed to the peak 
 Press on into the thin again till I cannot breathe 
 I swallowed so much of my damn pride that it chokes me 
 The real risk is not a slipped grip at the edge of the peak 
 The real danger is just to linger at the base of the thing 
 I know leaving's your living, built in your bones 
 No one can ever escape all of their ghosts 
 So if you walk, you better learn how to run 
 That's why I wrote this song 
 Your contrail's coated in broken homes 
 You polished up this pretty pearl of a hope 
 That I won't parade your skeletons for everyone 
 That's why I wrote this song 
 That's why I wrote this song (that's why I wrote this song) 
 That's why I wrote this song (that's why I wrote this song) 
 That's why I wrote this song (that's why I wrote this song) 
 I know you know the words, so sing along
