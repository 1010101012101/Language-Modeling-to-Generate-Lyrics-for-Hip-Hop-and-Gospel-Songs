Wherever we go, we'll never be lost 
 Some follow the compass rose, some Follow the cross 
 Me, I follow roads compulsively till sirens call me off 
 Then I wander, eyes closed, following song 
 The river's a hymnal and the leaves are applause 
 Trees sing in whispers with the wind pulling their arms 
 Hold still and listen, your hand on my heart 
 If you need them these beacons will lead you back to the start, yup 
 No axe has seen these woods since before your father stood 
 The path is beaten good from the feet of all who wandered through it 
 Old growth holds hope, let the brambles scrape your skin 
 Scars are story books, blood will wash away your sins 
 Now let that sun slip, then let that moon rise 
 Follow in no footsteps, listen for the true guides 
 Woods will play tricks upon pretty blue eyes 
 Is that glimmer the river or your village finally brought back to life? 
 Follow me tonight 
 I'll show you what it's like 
 To be alive 
 I know, it seems like we're all lost 
 But we see the secrets, we know the unknown 
 Know the unknown, know the unknown 
 Keep close, hold my hand girl, just be strong 
 We can follow this river right back to your home 
 Back to your home, back to your home 
 At a palace in Versailles, 400 years before this 
 They were packing up supplies, preparing for a long trip 
 They may not survive, many of them know this 
 But they would rather die than to leave the questions open 
 So this is why we try, we bet it all on hopeless 
 And swim against the tide until our every bone is broken 
 A sinking ship is still a ship till the captain spoke the obit 
 Till the crew has flew and crow's nest slips silent beneath the ocean 
 We set sail without an anchor, we count upon that never stop 
 An anchor's just a coffin nail waiting for the hammer drop 
 It holds you by the ankles till it pulls you to the Acheron 
 Trade stable to be able to slip out under devil's thumb 
 Keep your acres, my home is where my hat is hung 
 On postcard printed paper and love notes from the latice rungs 
 Blessed are the vagrant, the lonely are the static ones 
 It's every drifter's confirmation, this world is just ravishing 
 I know, it seems like we're all lost 
 We can follow this river right back to your home 
 River back home, river back home 
 I know, it seems like we're all lost 
 But we see the secrets, we know the unknown 
 Know the unknown, know the unknown 
 Keep close, hold my hand girl, just be strong 
 We can follow this river right back to your home 
 Back to your home, back to your home 
 I know, it seems like we're all lost 
 But we see the secrets, we know the unknown 
 Know the unknown, know the unknown
