I've been on some burn it down 
 Leave this town, never look back shit 
 Passing out on your couch, sneaking out the back tip 
 Ripping credit cards out your mail box, snatch shit 
 Charge it to the Gameplay boy, it's practice 
 (What are we talking about, practice?) 
 (We're talking 'bout practice, man.) 
 They be on some got this, squat this, reroute the power grid 
 Cops can't stop this, over our dead body, bitch 
 Heat this, drop this, turn it up louder kid 
 Put it down in our path, million ways around this shit 
 We backstage, sterilizing tattoos with beer 
 Your cats stay paralyzed from bad news and fear 
 You're underage, they ain't fucking let you in here 
 Fake ID, G, you'll buy us all a beer 
 I'm sick of kids who sit and bitch about they can't get into shit 
 Your 'woe is me' steez is just getting bit ridiculous 
 Fucking A you're underage, that means they just slap your wrist 
 If not you're young and fit, yeah bitch, I run the pits 
 Hah, and give them all trophies 
 Hah, and some orange slices 
 Yeah, y'all already know me 
 One of the only that's really grinding 
 Lazy motherfuckers want to call it luck 
 But real motherfuckers know there ain't no such 
 Thing 'cause I mean there ain't no free lunch 
 You better fix your own plate or serve one to us 
 Go and pray to your God or complain on Facebook 
 Stay waiting for your dad to come save the day, dog 
 Voted for Obama and expected change 
 It's just one big party all giving the same gifts 
 (SIKE) Like a P.O.S. t-shirt 
 (Yikes) It's only gonna be worse 
 (Right) But this beat is kinda beserk 
 Turn it up louder till my fucking teeth hurt 
 (SIKE) Like a P.O.S. t-shirt 
 (Yikes) It's only gonna be worse 
 (Right) But this beat is kinda beserk 
 Turn it up louder till my fucking teeth hurt 
 Yeah girl, I own some gold teeth 
 I southern, I was taught to hold heat 
 Ain't no gangster, tell that true 
 Rick Ross just a cop with some bad tattoos, hey 
 Florida baby and my neck stay real red 
 Why you make-believe pushing that white shit? 
 You dress up gangster, just can play pretend 
 I stay slinging them white girls 'round my bed 
 Young Steve McQueen, spit that dick game 
 You tweet real posse for a bitch with a tin chain 
 I don't need no Maybach just to sharpen my pimp game 
 Pull girls on my bike, ride my handlebars home, man 
 Ooh, I put my word on that chief 
 Rihanna gonna holla, way I murdered that beat 
 I cut them like an umbrella, King Kong in the bed sheets 
 Just try a better fella when you're done with that deadbeat 
 (SIKE) Like a P.O.S t-shirt 
 (Yikes) It only gonna be worse 
 (Right) Beat is kinda beserk 
 Turn it up louder till my fucking teeth hurt 
 See? I can write your dumb raps 
 Pay me and go buy some hubcaps 
 Fake Gs still talking 'bout gun claps 
 It ain't gonna happen, like A-Rod's comeback 
 Talent is cheap, money's all made up 
 Gallons of Beam and the speakers stay bassed up 
 Fuck it, I got nothing left to say, son 
 Y'all get Cryphy, thank you Bass God 
 (SIKE) Like a P.O.S t-shirt 
 (Yikes) It only gonna be worse 
 (Right) This beat is kinda beserk 
 Turn it up louder till my fucking teeth hurt 
 (SIKE) Like a P.O.S t-shirt 
 (Yikes) It only gonna be worse 
 (Right) And this beat is kinda beserk 
 Turn it up louder till my fucking teeth hurt
