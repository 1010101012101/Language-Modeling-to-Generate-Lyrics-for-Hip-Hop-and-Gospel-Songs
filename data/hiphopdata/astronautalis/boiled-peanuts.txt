Lift your legs, boy 
 Lift them please 
 Before you cross them tracks 
 You gonna end up just like me 
 Don't be headstrong 
 Don't ever be mean 
 Before you cross them tracks 
 You better lift them goddamned feet 
 'Cause you ain't never gon', never gon', never gon' 
 Never find love 
 'Fore you'll end up, end up just like me 
 'Cause you ain't never gon', never gon', never gon' 
 Never find love 
 'Fore you cross them tracks 
 You better lift them goddamned feet 
 I was getting dragged out the back of the club 
 'Cause gats waving (true story) 
 Back then Hendricks Ave. was downright dangerous 
 Naiveté made me downright brainless 
 So, I'd battle some old gangsters 
 And embarrass them in front of their neighbors 
 And he get pissed, 'cause I dissed too damn hard 
 Served by this white dork, yeah that's too damn cold 
 So, he straight flipped, dipped out to his car 
 To pop the trunk on this young punk like "coup d’état" 
 Shout out to Willie Ev, Mark Lynn and Tim Hall 
 And everyone in Jack Rabbits that had street smarts 
 'Cause I was so dumb I couldn't tell what's wrong 
 Oh, you mad bro 'cause just can't rap this strong? 
 Duval gave me all the fuckin' slang I need 
 Ian Ranne played me eight ball & Mary-Jane 
 Nathan Antolik straight repped for me 
 When all them other rap dorks stayed clownin' on a G 
 Lift your legs boy 
 Lift them please 
 Before you cross them tracks 
 You gon' end up just like me 
 Don't be headstrong 
 Don't ever be mean 
 Before you cross them tracks 
 You better lift them goddamned feet 
 DJ Blue mixed tapes and Lord Finesse 
 Raised on bass and on a worn slick deck 
 Learned my slang right down the block 
 From where Rick Ross claimed that he pitched them rocks 
 He went to Silver Fox for strippers, I'm at Sheik for lunch 
 Fuckin' bumpin' King Tee's "Dippin" in my old pickup 
 Man, I never wrote a written for like three years plus 
 But was freestyling the very second they stopped the bus, uh 
 All my homies in the hallways of Douglas Anderson 
 Batting each other all day any chance we get 
 It was there I learned my sharp slang and my razor wit 
 With fuckin' Willis Billips on that beat box kid, yeah 
 Shout out to fuckin' Alvin, Mayor of Jacksonville 
 Getting money since he whipped his first Caddy wheel 
 The prince of Mayport got that flip-flop tan that's so damn real 
 Rest in peace to Pablo 9 and our fucking Village Inn 
 Lift your legs, boy 
 Lift them please 
 Before you cross them tracks 
 You gon' end up just like me 
 Don't be headstrong 
 Don't ever be mean 
 Before you cross them tracks 
 You better lift them goddamned feet 
 ('Cause you ain't never gon', never gon', never gon') 
 (Never find love) 
 ('Fore you'll end up, end up just like me) 
 ('Cause you ain't never gon', never gon', never gon') 
 (Never find love) 
 ('Fore you cross them tracks) 
 (You better lift them goddamned feet) 
 (Lift your legs, boy) 
 (Lift them please) 
 (Before you cross them tracks) 
 (You gon' end up just like me) 
 (Don't be headstrong) 
 (Don't ever be mean) 
 (Before you cross them tracks) 
 (You better lift them goddamned feet) 
 ('Cause you ain't never gon', never gon', never gon') 
 (Never find love) 
 ('Fore you'll end up, end up just like me)
