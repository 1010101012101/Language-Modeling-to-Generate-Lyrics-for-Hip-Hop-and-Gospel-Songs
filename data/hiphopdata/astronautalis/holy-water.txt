Well it's hope, it's hope, that has me staring to the burning sky 
 I know, I know, there's something hidden, on the other side 
 I woke, I woke with such a feeling I could never rise 
 Now I'm gazing skyward till the sun just burned me blind 
 Burned me blind, burned me blind 
 Burned me blind, burned me blind 
 Well, one drank up the holy water hoping for a light 
 While another slipped a sewing bodkin right inside his eye 
 And they ran out from the city calling, collecting salts and lye 
 Crack and crush it, burn it maybe baby, find the God inside 
 God inside, God inside, yeah 
 God inside, God inside 
 We know there's something to which we're blind 
 'Cause it's hope that pulls us forward till we die 
 Ollie ollie oxen free, come out from where you hide 
 Tell me, tell me what you want from me, I promise I provide 
 I'll drink your poison, I'll keep you company, I'll serve you till I die 
 Come on, crack Pandora's Box for me, blind me with the light 
 With the light, with the light, come on 
 With the light, with the light 
 Learn the language of our Holy Fathers retrace their sacred rights 
 Plot and chart the arc of Haley's Comet, floating through the night 
 I drain my blood until my chalky body feels closer to the sky 
 I dance upon the edge of death just to prove that I'm alive 
 I'm alive, I'm alive, yeah 
 I'm alive, I'm alive 
 We know there's something to which we're blind 
 'Cause it's hope that pulls us forward till we die
