I should've torn out your black heart and given it away 
 As you stood on that exact spot on that rainy day 
 That rainy day 
 I should've turned and just walked off, never said a thing 
 But fuck it, if I was that smart I'd never learned your name 
 Never learned your name 
 I couldn't tell you how it all starts, but I know just how it ends 
 Baby, we were born to burn out, not fade away 
 I won't fade away 
 So come on, take my hand, darlin', and don't let go again 
 We'll run till we both fall or burst into flames 
 We'll burst into flames 
 Whoa 
 Whoa 
 One hand strikes the match 
 One hand guards the flame 
 We were born to burn out, baby 
 We will never fade away 
 Said, one hand strikes the match 
 One hand guards the flame 
 We were born to burn out, baby 
 We will never fade away, away
