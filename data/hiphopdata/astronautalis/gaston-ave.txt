Call you up upon the telephone, noone answer 
 Call again, it rings, I call again 
 I think of stopping by or stopping in 
 But never leave home 
 Tripping back and forth between the bar and home 
 And looking back and forth at what I done 
 Collected bottle caps and soggy scraps of high life label peelings 
 Running tabs, a running up and down the walls again 
 Climbing up the slang on stalls of friends 
 Somethin' 'bout good times tonight and baby Jesus 
 Your letters are the ladder I climb rung by rung 
 To claw my way up to the gates of Heaven 
 The sketches and scratches you draw drunk and alone 
 Gives me the map that I'll follow back home, back home 
 Follow back home, back home 
 Follow back home, back home 
 Send me home, take me home, I gotta get, I gotta go 
 Cut me up, cut me off, kick me out 
 I'm busy man, I got a schedule to keep 
 Where's my data, where's my gun and where's my hat 
 I'm madder than a... where's my phone and where's the fax 
 Can't look past you're hacking at the forest but you never hit a tree 
 Tell me one more time and tell me once more, promise that I'll listen 
 But I can't be promis-isn' I'll be baking cakes 
 Or building you no castles by the sea 
 Good little lady, you driving me crazy 
 Why don't you swing my way and find your seat 
 Your lipstick is lazy your eyes are all hazy 
 There's somethin' behind the whiskey whispers you speak 
 That rocks me to sleep 
 Rocks me to sleep 
 Rocks me to sleep 
 Rocks me to sleep 
 (There must be something terribly wrong with me) 
 (Sometimes I feel like I haven't learned anything) 
 Good little lady, you driving me crazy 
 Why don't you swing my way and find your seat 
 Your lipstick is lazy your eyes are all hazy 
 There's somethin' behind the whiskey whispers you speak 
 That rocks me to sleep 
 Rocks me to sleep 
 Rocks me to sleep 
 Rocks me to sleep
