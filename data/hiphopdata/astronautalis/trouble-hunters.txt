I know it's hopeless, Hell 
 Ain't big enough to hold us back. 
 Come on, let's pick a fight. 
 We hunt for trouble tonight. 
 I know it's hopeless, Hell 
 Ain't big enough to hold us back. 
 Come on, boys, we're right! 
 We hunt for trouble 
 Tonight, tonight, tonight. 
 Tonight, tonight, tonight. 
 Tonight, tonight, tonight. 
 You know we're right! 
 We hunt for trouble 
 With our fingers dipped in blood. 
 We hold the rifles 
 With a hangman's heart. 
 If reunited 
 'Fore the last sun lie, 
 The snake 
 They cut in the parts 
 That come back alive for 'em. 
 Brother Benjamin is off in France. 
 We're taking Trenton back again. 
 The garrison of Hessians will fall. 
 They say Delaware will freeze a man. 
 We chasin' sovereigns 
 Across the Styx and dodging ice floes. 
 It's all on Honeyman, 
 Our mole inside the ivy that grows. 
 So unnatural to see this leaf 
 So far from its home. 
 Must deracinate the weed, 
 Drive it out of the loam. 
 I know it's hopeless, Hell 
 Ain't big enough to hold us back. 
 Come on, let's pick a fight. 
 We hunt for trouble tonight. 
 I know it's hopeless, Hell 
 Ain't big enough to hold us back. 
 Come on, boys, we're right! 
 We hunt for trouble 
 Tonight, tonight, tonight. 
 Tonight, tonight, tonight. 
 Tonight, tonight, tonight. 
 You know we're right! 
 With fingers frozen from tracking 
 And groping and trapping, 
 Found the trouble and coupled 
 At the mouths that prize the purse from the apt. 
 And the victim claimed by the slow mechanism 
 That broke its opponents back. 
 While the crimson coats were bending elbows in half, 
 We attacked! 
 I know you noticed the battle. 
 It don't need quoting. 
 It's spoken over ad nauseum. 
 Darling, the sharpest story. 
 Every veteran, politician, talking head'll 
 Get on the pedestal, 
 Spin the saga any way 
 That will make their means our end. 
 We, we've got ourselves a fight song 
 For the wool they'll pull over your eyes. 
 Tell the devil that we're coming right home 
 Tonight, tonight. 
 I know it's hopeless, Hell 
 Ain't big enough to hold us back. 
 Come on, let's pick a fight. 
 We hunt for trouble tonight! 
 I know it's hopeless, Hell 
 Ain't big enough to hold us back. 
 Come on, boys, we're right! 
 We hunt for trouble 
 Tonight, tonight, tonight. 
 Tonight, tonight, tonight. 
 Tonight, tonight, tonight. 
 You know we're right! 
 One, two, three, four. 
 I know it's hopeless, Hell 
 Ain't big enough to hold us back. 
 Come on, let's pick a fight! 
 We hunt for trouble tonight! 
 I know it's hopeless, Hell 
 Ain't big enough to hold us back. 
 Come on, boys, we're right! 
 We hunt for trouble 
 Tonight, tonight, tonight. 
 Tonight, tonight, tonight. 
 Tonight, tonight, tonight. 
 You know we're right!
