It's over nigga one sandscript 
 The heckler makes good fellas run frantic 
 Guns I brandish make men vanish 
 Got bodies in Kansas, across the Atlantic 
 Once me and lance hit, you don't wanna chance it 
 No matter how you plan, you can't antic- 
 Ipate it, stupid nigga hestiated 
 Now his remains be cremated 
 (?) (?) (?) Never debated 
 The killings clean, its shyne related 
 Do it like suicide can't retrace it 
 Heckler Koch too hot? Gotta replace it 
 Charge is murder, never attempted 
 I tried, you died cause no defense is 
 Strong enough to withstand my assault 
 Before I go hit your safe and the vault 
 They fled through the night (?) (?) 
 Hitler hit ya, lives is lost 
 Bodies is found dead, no remorse 
 Gun fire to the tire, to exhaust 
 Catch fire, we aspire to extort 
 Kids with valuables in all resources 
 Cops will never find where the corpse is 
 While we driving 12's, and box porsches 
 We cop their names and squeeze 
 Hit the target, then flee 
 So nigga tell me what you wanna do 
 Is dying what you wanna do? 
 Organized crime, mafia 
 Touch mine got heckler koch for ya 
 Daily news nigga, make ya popular 
 Gone by the morn, while maggots rotten ya 
 So be cautious, you don't wanna cross us 
 Force us, to leave your body corpsed up 
 (?) (?) (?) Tell 'em boys horsed up 
 While we fledding 12's 300 horsed up 
 My hand never far from the safety, 
 Fucking with me? too bad for your safety 
 Nigga hard stares, kill that 
 Before you find yourself tied up and kidnapped 
 Chopped up, let 'em find out where your ribs at 
 Days later; send it to your mom gift wrapped, get that? 
 I say fuck a fist fight 
 Banana clip fights 
 Is what I'm into 
 100 rounds into you 
 For the torque and this ain't interview 
 Shootin every inch of you 
 Then hit the mall and buy a mink or two 
 Brooklyn gettin' money, that be the principal 
 I got guns armstrong like BJ 
 Have you runnin' fast like it's a relay 
 Race, pray once I'm reachin' my weights 
 No bullets (?) (?) and weights 
 He don't know I kill armies 
 Don't tell him when bullets hit him and figure like Tommy 
 Get the picture, sweet dreams when I kiss ya 
 Rock the sleep, wrap the sheets, call the priest 
 Talk is cheap, 
 Bullets pricly I make you pay me 
 The cost might be 
 An arm, a leg or an organ 
 L.A to New York, fuck your origin 
 I'm killin', send national guards in 
 To stop me 
 Killed more crews than Motley 
 Cop the 
 Heckler 50 caliber 
 Blaze andything standing my diameter 
 Die slow nigga, die slow 
 Die slow nigga, die slow 
 Die slow nigga, die slow 
 Die slow cocksucker, die slow 
 *Gun fire while beat fades out*
