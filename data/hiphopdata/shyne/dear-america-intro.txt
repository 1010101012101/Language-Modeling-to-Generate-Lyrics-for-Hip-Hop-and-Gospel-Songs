Dear America, 
 I'm only what you made me, young, black, and fuckin' crazy 
 Please save me 
 I'm dyin' inside, can't you see it in my eyes? 
 I'm hopeless, and fearless on the outside, gun on my side 
 Shit, Maby if y'all niggas build schools instead of prison, maybe I'll stop 
 Livin' the way I'm livin', probably not. 
 I'm so used to servin' rocks and burnin' blocks, I ain't never gonna stop. 
 Been doin' this shit all my life, I'm a lost cause, 
 And what about the rest? Don't them suckers deserve a chance? Somethin' 
 Better then shoot-outs, liquor stores and food stamps? Maybe if y'all teach 
 Them niggas a craft an' a trade, they wouldn't have to play that corner, know 
 What I mean? Servin' that yay 
 America, you got a fuckin' problem, an I ain't never goin' away 
 There's about 20 million other mutha fuckers just like me, preperattions is 
 Through, y'all gonna pay
