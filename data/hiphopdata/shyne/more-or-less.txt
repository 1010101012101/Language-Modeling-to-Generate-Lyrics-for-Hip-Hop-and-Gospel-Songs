(Foxy) Gyeah 
 (Shyne) Gyeah, walk with me 
 (Foxy) 
 Gyeah, It's like New York's been soft 
 Ever since my nigga Shyne been sittin' in prison 
 Yeah 
 (Verse 1) Shyne 
 Check it, sip things sick rings, this shit is sickening 
 Sick chains sick aim, 5th bang 5th frame 
 Bail money lawyers actin' funny when I come through 
 Hit 'em with a bundle on a humble 
 Couple notes, seen boys arms with a rolls said I want one too 
 What the fuck I'm gone do 
 But get it if it's there to be gotten till I'm driving by 
 And I'm rockin' sideways muthafucka crime pays 
 I need it I'll get it I got it I'll shop it I'll double the profit 
 And bubble the pockets, I'm living to die 
 Niggaz talk fly till I walk by and pop somethin' 
 Muthafuckas forgot somethin', I'm not frontin' 
 This ain't rap, music this ain't that 
 You fuck around I'll have you sleepin' where the saints at 
 Sincerely yours Shyne muthafuckin' Po 
 Bitch get yo bags hit the muthafuckin' door 
 May the angels walk with me, more or less 
 Big things, Big rims nigga, more or less 
 Fuckin' big stars in big cars, more or less 
 I can say I seen it all and done it all, more or less 
 G is a G, a key is a key a snitch is a fish 
 With no fins that can't swim when I dump him in the river 
 Charcoal gray are, 12 cylinders bulletproof sentences 
 Trial date tentative 
 I sound like who, y'all sound like trash 
 Get off my dick and pass my cash 
 They don't do it 'cause I rap about it 
 I rap about it 'cause they do it 
 My musics the conduet to a ticket I live it 
 Bitch nigga I cook it and pitch it 
 By the prints that bought the shit and ditch it 
 Hip Hop ain't responsible for balancing America 
 America's responsible for balancing America 
 Back to the flow nose full of dough 
 Rolls full of hoe's leave a nigga clothes full of holes 
 The schools didn't want me so the drug dealers taught me 
 Simple math step on it twice and bring 'em back 
 Get 4 times what you paid divide the labor costs 
 And still come away with enough to play 
 And I see the same shit niggaz younger than me 
 Runnin' the streets lookin' for somethin' to eat 
 Ole boy betta get down better run for cover 
 When I spit rounds ah you in some shit now 
 Get found slit down to the white meat 
 I'm from Brooklyn Vietnam nigga I like beef 
 But being a bird in the street double plight 
 Livin' a troubled life, father was a jerk 
 Moms had to work, poppy had to work 
 So I did what any real nigga would do 
 Got in front of the stove now I got the shit sowed 
 Fuck you punk niggaz witcho punk cash 
 With the punk blast put yo punk ass in the trunk fast 
 The fuck y'all thought 
 I buried niggaz in walls, I'ma trill muthafucka after all 
 Point blank shootin niggaz point blank all the way to the bank 
 Rip yo face off then I'll take off 
 The difference between me and them, you won't be seein' them 
 No more, nigga secrets of war
