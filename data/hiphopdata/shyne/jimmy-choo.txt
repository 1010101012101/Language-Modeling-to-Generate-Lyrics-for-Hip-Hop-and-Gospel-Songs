 Touch me like you do 
 Can't nobody 
 Love me like you do 
 And can't nobody 
 Be like me and you 
 This is Me! 
 I'm mostly respected 
 Ring down to the necklace 
 Some hos say I'm sexist 
 'Cause all I wanna do is stuff coke in they breastes 
 Sit back, lift stakes, count money 
 In the zone, roll tha doe 
 Like this, come on 
 I need a prada chick 
 To take this dick, and take this script 
 And flick this shit, base this shit 
 We can go shopping and buy some things 
 Up in harry winston ma, try some rings 
 How you feel like you is prince di 
 So much cuts on your wrist 
 They could draw suiside 
 No lie, you ain't heard? 
 Extensive trips, expensive rips 
 You ain't seen nothing like this 
 Not in your life 
 If I ain't that nigga, shit you fuckin' right 
 (Ashanti) 
 Can't nobody

 Just post bail, a million in cash

 Body smoked like we was jus ganna clap em' up 
 That ain't enough? then why you backin up 
 Niggas talkin' real greesy on them rap records

 Give it to my soldiers like "hold this" 
 Fuck you nigga you could never fool this 
 But anyway back to business
