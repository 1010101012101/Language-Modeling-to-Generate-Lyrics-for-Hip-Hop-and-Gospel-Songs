Once upon a time, not long ago 
 When gangstas rock waves so dope and sniff blow 
 There was a young G by the name of Shyne Poe 
 Puttin' it down, cuttin' it up and cookin' it now 
 It's been a lotta dick ridin' for lack of a betta word 
 Speculations on the guns I hold underneath my furs 
 Similarities in my voice nigga check the words 
 I'm influential to doe's that pinch birds from the curb 
 Dodgin' and dippin' the narc 
 Since the young Frank Matthews the rap version 
 Touch my trap on my smack the gats burstin' 
 That's certain leave ya face and ya chest and ya back jerkin' 
 Uh--y'all got me fucked up like 
 My desert eagle and my sig don't bust right 
 Like my guns is racin', muthafucka don't you know I 
 Make ya heart stop and ya body start shakin' 
 Now you know the bottom line of this rhyme crime 
 25 to life plus 9 
 Whatcha gon' do when shit hit the fan 
 Take it like a man or snitch like a bitch 
 Whatcha gon' do when shit hit the fan 
 Pray to God, go hard or lay up in the morgue 
 Evil grin, dead eyes, walkin' wit a bop, mobster 
 Best way to describe my posture 
 In this world of sin I'm as wicked as they come 
 Moonlightin' as a rapper get this ticket and I'm done 
 Ain't enough money here I ratha be in the tropics 
 Wit corsicans where narcotics is the only topic 
 Persian rocks and things the man that made of snow 
 Tiger paw and every other form of raw 
 Since a teen been handlin, nigga been scramblin' 
 Bettin' on money in Vegas gamblin' 
 Desert in the abdomen, pissy drunk stylin', staggerin' 
 More than you can imaginin 
 Uh--thoughts randomin, runnin' through my mind 
 Like who's the best MC's - Biggie, Jay-Z, and Shyne 
 Demented as a young'n, alpo second comin' 
 Evil thoughts runnin' through my cerebellum 
 Shyne Poe what the fuck you gon' tell 'em? 
 All you niggas that wanna be fly my gun shots'll propell 'em 
 Leavin' somewhere smellin', repellin' 
 Crows caskets for you fuckin' bastads c'mon 
 Only the strong survive, weak niggas bleed 
 And get found, wit they fuckin' face down 
 Numb from the waist down 
 I done been to hell and back 
 Twice and still in crack 
 Stared death in the eyes and never blink 
 Had shots rip through my mink 
 Went to war wit the realest killas 
 Killed friends over jealousy and envy 
 My heart's empty 
 Behind the wheel of my Bentley 
 Coked up feelin' invincible 
 'Bout to take over the world I can't be stopped 
 Not the feds or the fuckin' cops 
 Not even 17 shots 
 Can but a end to this terror 
 I'ma live forever, 'cause gangstas don't break 
 We just get plastic surgery and relocate 
 To anotha state, or island 
 Smilin', money pilin', wildin' 
 Yo Puff overdub them fuckin' violins 
 Uh this shit is bigger than me though ask Oliver North 
 Kill you then use your corpse, to transport whores 
 Leave ya brains hangin' from ya fuckin' car window 
 Any nigga snitchin' givin' info 
 Since my motha stomach coke and liquor 
 Was the mixture 
 Betta be prepared when we hit ya 
 Chorus: Fade till end
