 Verse 1 (Kurupt) 
 Kurupt and Daz, grips on a handle 
 Two to the mandible 
 Bows and Bees 
 Bustas and G's 
 Pound and Shyne, hammer that's clickin for me one more time 
 Up and Down, In and Out 
 Spinning Out, spinning in and out 
 I seen niggaz like you that usually get blasted 
 Cameras to memorialize open caskets 
 Open season, rhyme or reason 
 Crimetime, primetime, V-I-C this 
 Young Gagstra, step in and jump on the hostages 
 Smoke like sausages, niggaz covering their heads like ostriches 
 Ostrisize, swallow like lasengers... 
 CO's so crooked (crooked) 
 Come equipped when the shank sticks 
 (Chorus One: Kurupt - Nate Dogg)

 Where all the gangstas at, rollin' through homie 
 Fleetwoods cadillacs straight gangsta mash 
 Before I got stuck, I was cool as fuck 
 On the streets nigga, like I ain't give a fuck

 And this is how we do it nigga, already to dump 
 I got a bitch, she's known for eatin a dick (bullshit) 
 I never gave a fuck nigga, nigga never gave a shit
