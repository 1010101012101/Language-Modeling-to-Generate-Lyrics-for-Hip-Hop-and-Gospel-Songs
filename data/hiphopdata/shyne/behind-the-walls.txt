(Kurupt) 
 Burn so crooked (crooked) 
 The Poet likes to spit (spit) 
 Kareem, that's my dog 
 Life, behind the walls 
 Nigga life, behind the walls 
 Yeah, welcome to "Oz" niggas, surprise niggas 
 Keep ya head right, keep ya game tight 
 Ya might not make it through the night (hold up) 
 This ain't nothing but war in here 
 We over packed in here, you put more in here? 
 'Bout to rain like snow and let it all go 
 Father Ray, to cut 
 I'm gon' need all the friends I could get 
 'Cause I'm through with this shit 
 Hit up Time, yeah 
 Tell me something good man 
 'Cause I'm so discombobulated being out the hood 
 I don't know if it's a bad or a good thing 
 Missing Cadillac's switches in the wood grain 
 Don't touch on my mattress, it ain't cool 
 Simon on the yard straight tripping on fools 
 C-O so crooked (crooked) 
 Come equipped when the shank sticks 
 (Bridge: Kurupt) 
 Yeah, that's my dogg 
 Life, behind the walls 
 Life, behind the walls 
 Suckers, welcome to "Oz" niggas, surprise niggas 
 (Chorus: Nate Dogg) 
 West coast representing for all my doggs 
 One love to my doggs behind the walls 
 Nate Dogg and I'm tight for all of y'all 
 Stand strong, stand tall, and never fall 
 West coast representing for all my doggs 
 One love to my doggs behind the walls 
 Nate Dogg and I'm tight for all of y'all 
 Stand strong, stand tall, and never fall 
 (Kurupt) 
 Quick to get ticked off 
 Every other day, take this with ya (with ya) 
 The politics stretched out, we all stressed out 
 Do your thing and I'ma do my thing 
 We up in the zoo, headed-quarter ? to the West wang 
 Oh you serving up something? Well you gotta kick in 
 It's the politics to y'all politicians 
 Kicked in, shank stick in 
 Only God dump, inmates gets stuck 
 I'm smoking on a hump, hollin at her 
 A fool walked up, talking 'bout the phone 
 Phone check huh? I miss my pump 
 It ain't no thing even though he's holding boulders 
 I'ma still squabble this fool from the shoulders 
 If I win or lose the respect that counts 
 Be the first take off (??) P.C. out 
 The guard so crooked (crooked) 
 Come equipped when the shank sticks 
 (Nate Dogg) 
 Well I've arrived at my new home, cell three 
 I looked around and what did I see? 
 One of them clowns one of my enemies 
 Gotta stay down so I make me some weed 
 It's going down in the morning on me 
 Soon as they say "Hey line up," let's leave 
 Right now the nigga just as safe as can be 
 But when we hit the kitchen man sleep 
 Nate Dogg and I'm tight for all of y'all 
 When you wanna make a hit, give me a call 
 West coast representing for all my doggs 
 One love to my doggs behind the walls 
 Nate Dogg and I'm tight for all of y'all 
 Stand strong, stand tall, and never fall 
 West coast representing for all my doggs 
 One love to my doggs behind the walls 
 (Kurupt) 
 In here, we work out, re-utilize time 
 Finding something in ourselves to find 
 I make you go see, Sister Peter Marie 
 I'm the jaw tapper, I'ma be a G in here like Antonio Nappa 
 Doctor Gloria fix ya up completely 
 I just might stick myself so she can feel on me 
 Watch out boy (boy!) It's coming fast (fast) 
 White lightning's 'bout to strike 
 It don't matter who up in here boy (boy!) 
 There's sixteen inmates just like him 
 Violent as a Viking, systematic, terrible, tragic 
 Tragic, drastic, spasmatic, casualties growing like cancer 
 I'm all outta breath like a nigga asthmatic 
 With asthma, here's the perfect answer 
 And also here's ya last chance to just 
 Try to make it over the wall (the wall) 
 The inmates are so crooked (crooked) 
 Come equipped when the shank sticks 
 (Kurupt) 
 Yeah, so crooked, c'mon, come equipped when the shank sticks 
 Yeah, that's my dogg, (Dogg Pound) 
 Life behind the walls (it's like that) 
 Spending life behind the walls 
 Welcome to "Oz" 
 Life behind the walls [Repeat: x4]
