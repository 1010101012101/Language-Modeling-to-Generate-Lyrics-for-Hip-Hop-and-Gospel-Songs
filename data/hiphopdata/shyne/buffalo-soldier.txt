Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rasta 
 I used to be a mobster burning down the block 
 Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rasta 
 I used to be a mobster burning down the block 
 Don't judge a book by the cover 
 Everything will be in this world is your brother 
 When I lost the fun ? uncover 
 Ancient words that teach me to love ya! 
 So we burn to return to the mother 
 And we yearn to unlearn all they told ya about yourself 
 Who you are, what you should be, 
 I'm gonna be free leave it up to me! 
 Shouts through the sky, look out to the night 
 Feel all right! 
 Stars burn bright, I like the moonlight 
 You'll be all right! 
 Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rasta 
 I used to be a mobster burning up the block 
 Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rasta 
 I used to be a mobster burning up the block 
 Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rasta 
 I used to be a mobster burning up the block 
 This is the medicine, I'm out like the Bedouin 
 This knife I'm burying and this life I'm treasuring 
 This is the medicine, I'm out like the Bedouin 
 Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a monster 
 Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a monster 
 Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a monster 
 I went running away to the cave 
 Went in a slave and came out all flames 
 I went running away for the hills 
 Back to my roots and I'm running still 
 But now I'm running to face my dreams 
 Found my place and what it means 
 Find yourself and no one else 
 You have to leave it up to me, leave it up to me! 
 Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rasta 
 I used to be a mobster burning up the block 
 Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rasta 
 I used to be a mobster burning up the block 
 Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rasta 
 I used to be a mobster burning up the block 
 This is the medicine, I'm not like the Bedouin 
 With this knife I'm burying and this life I'm treasuring 
 Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rasta 
 Buffalo soldier, you know I'm not a rasta 
 I used to be a mobster burning down the block 
 I shot the sheriff, the DA, and the deputy 
 Sorry Al Sharpton I don't need you to lecture me 
 Maybe I'll stop talking about guns 
 When you talk about the funds that they cut for the youth 
 Let's cut to the truth, ain't enough for the youth 
 So tell me how you judge me till you're stuck in the shoes, man! 
 Where the Congressmen, where all the Senators? 
 They're thinking about their green, not the color of the President? 
 This is just a relevance, survival is the sentiment 
 Narcotics is the only way you know that I'm a measure it! 
 They say that we are in a post Obama era 
 Well exactly what that mean? you needn't make it clearer 
 Does it mean that the rich are gonna finally start to share up 
 Re-proportion the wealth and make things fairer 
 Asking God "why do poor people suffer" but now I'm such a hypocrite, 
 The Rolls Royce mufflers. 
 In the gutters nobody never loved us 
 I am just the result of pain and hunger! 
 Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rasta 
 I used to be a mobster burning up the block 
 Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rasta 
 I used to be a mobster burning up the block 
 Buffalo soldier, I know I'm not a rasta 
 I used to be a mobster burning up the block
