Pa pa pa pa pa? 
 Here we go shawty in the team 
 ? Nobody never ? places that you ain't never? 
 Are you never seen ? got your 
 This number after nine. Damnnit girl you're fine 
 And I be lying if I said I wasn't tryin' to take your time 
 I know you probably been approached a thousand times 
 But I've seen guys who probably lied about their lies 
 And left you hangin' out to dry. 
 Well this ain't that type of story. My love is mandatory 
 And if I had a price tag, very few could afford me. 
 I'm mister call me when you horny. And I'll be there till the morning 
 Now every sentence with my name is so exclamatory. 
 I stand in the gas and glory she sing me a Spanish story 
 And she ain't even Spanish. How unexplanatory. 
 She keep it wet like a storm and I drive her she ridin' sports 
 See there's a first time for everything and you deserve a felon 
 Because shawty you a ten 
 ? You ain't' got to be ? pretend 
 Got my ? pretend 
 She says she never tried 
 And it'll be her very first time 
 Her very first time 
 Told her everything will be all right 
 Just buckle up tight and leave the rest to me 
 You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing at all 
 Relax girl everything will be OK 
 I'll be the chauffeur I'm the one to call 
 Sit back, enjoy the ride, and lemme me do my thang. 
 I'm on it. Your boyfriends been demoted 
 I'm so potent she's so focused 
 Notions and my hocus pocus 
 I divide her what's the quotient? 
 And no I'm not her man but I'm the closest 
 Thing to her heart when I enter 
 I'm in her like a splinter 
 Dessert her after dinner I go sinner 
 Than I send her to a place that she ain't' never been 
 And now she stuntin' hard like they never did
