All right, come on 
 Ooh 
 Come on... 
 I know I sound a little different on the radio, 
 But don't be mad, I'm just doin' what they pay me for. 
 I find myself constantly thinkin' "what they hatin' for?" but I know... 
 It's 'cause I made it to the top and, 
 I ain't never stoppin', can't nobody bring me down... 
 Need a fire from a flame, now watch me change the Game, 
 This gonn be how they cool me down... 
 Ooh 
 I'm burnin up, when you hear me on the radio, gonna turn it up... 
 It's the ulti-imitated, but never duplicated... 
 Wonderin why these niggas hatin', but it's probably 'cause I made it... 
 And the top is such a lonely place, 
 Like everywhere that I go I can't help but to see a phony face, 
 'Cause the same ones doubt me, 
 When it comes 'bout me, get the fuck around me now... 
 Roscoe Dash goin' straight to the top, 
 'Cause I'm so turned up and I can't turn down... I swear its... 
 It's all I know, I grind hard, and I know it shows, 
 But it's all I know... 
 Come on... 
 I know I sound a little different on the radio, 
 But don't be mad, I'm just doin' what they pay me for. 
 I find myself constantly thinkin' "what they hatin' for?" but I know... 
 It's 'cause I made it to the top and, 
 I ain't never stoppin', can't nobody bring me down... 
 Need a fire from a flame, now watch me change the Game, 
 This gonna be how they cool me down...
