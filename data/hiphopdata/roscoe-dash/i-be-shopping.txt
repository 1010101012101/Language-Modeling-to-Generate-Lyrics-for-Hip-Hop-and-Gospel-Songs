 1st Verse: 
 And I be rockin' all type of colors 
 My swag is like a sauna (er) 
 I be dressin like a hippie 
 You could swear I was a stoner 
 Where'd you get ya swag from 
 Sir I swear that I'm the owner 
 Why should I believe you 
 'Cause I don't fuck with loaners 
 I get it how I live it I swear that's my true religion 
 I spent 25 strong just in true religion 
 Then I hit adidas just to get my feet up 
 That's another 20 bands d*mn 
 I'm glad I got my cheese up 
 I be shoppin', shoppin', shoppin', shoppin', shoppin' all day 
 And land in station H&M d*mn near every day 
 Then I hit the eagle now I'm flyer than a eagle 
 And the way that I be swaggin? 
 Man this shit should be illegal 
 Come onnnn

 Lil Doom: 
 Got a eagle on my chest and I'm lookin' real fly 
 When I hit the mall all the girls give me the eye 
 And people we must ride
