What happened to you callin me last night? 
 -You know i, i, I had a... 
 What the hell was you doin' that was so important? 
 -I had, I had somethin'... 
 You know what I don't even wanna know 
 -What you mean? 
 I don't think I can do this anymore 
 Elevator love 
 Your love is was up 
 I know we have our ups and downs 
 We go from kissin', huggin, lovin' 
 To screamin, fightin, fussin 
 Now your talkin' bout your kickin me out 
 But when you go up down 
 Up down 
 Those quickly turn to love sounds 
 Everytime I call she pick me up 
 Just like a bus route 
 Trade the love for nothin' girl 
 Your love is irreplaceable 
 'Cause you are my everything 
 Our elevator love is full of ups and downs 
 But then agrivated accusations when I come around 
 You say you know what's goin' on 
 When I'm out there on the road 
 What do you think I'm kickin it with hoes 
 When I don't call after my show 
 But little do you know that your love is irreplaceable 
 Your love is number one 
 Because you do your best to make it so 
 Wifey status 
 You the badest 
 Sexual professional 
 N I be out my mind 
 If I ever thought to let you go 
 You got my mind goin' up and down like an elevator 
 The things you do got me wonderin why I even bother 
 Our love is strong 
 But sometimes I just wanna let it go 
 But the next minute were under covers 
 So lets take it slow 
 Hoo ha - hoo ha 
 Why you got me sayin' 
 Hoo ha - hoo ha 
 What the things you doin' 
 Tell me why you playin' 
 When you know I'm stayin 
 Your elevator love 
 Keeps me elevated
