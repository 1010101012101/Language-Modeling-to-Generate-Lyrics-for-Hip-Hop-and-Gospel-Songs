She got pictures of her last man, all in her trash can 
 She focus just hopeless, you too much like her past and 
 She in a mind state where her grind rate 
 Sets her apart from all the live bait

 And those hips and thighs you dream about she more than carries 
 Pills and berries can't describe how she measures up 
 She's a dime, that describes why she acting up 
 She acting all sidity its 'cause she know she's bad 
 She makes her own money, spend it like she never had 
 She's way too smart for scheming, she got too much class 
 So when she in the room, she got it on smash
