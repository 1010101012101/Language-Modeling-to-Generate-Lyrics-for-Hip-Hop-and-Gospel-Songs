Brothers and sisters, we are gathered here today to celebrate in the loss of the 
 Evil and sinful person known as Blaze. Just like his soul shall be blazing in the 
 Pits of hell, his name is most adequate. Ladies and gentlemen, we are not here to 
 Be sorrowful at this point, for his death is nothing but a blessing brought from 
 God himself so that we may rejoice and know that there is rightousness. That there 
 Are angels of vengeance that will strike down upon the evil and wicked of the 
 World. Look at his body... look at him. So eeevil! They say that he was rich with 
 Cash and he was a rapper. What is a rapper? He is no more than Satan's tool, so 
 That he can speak the voice of the devil himself, spitting his raaaap flows, so 
 That people can be seduced with his wicked rhymes. Well I say this: you shall be 
 Seduced by demons in hell brother. You are on a one way ticket straight to where 
 No one holy will ever set foot. You shall bake in the very pits of hell...
