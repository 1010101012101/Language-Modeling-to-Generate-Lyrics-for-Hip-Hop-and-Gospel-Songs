(Violent J) 
 Killas kick the anthem like this 
 Juggalos up in this bitch, up in this bitch 
 Killas kick the anthem like this 
 Juggalos up in this biiiitch, blaze 
 (Blaze Ya Dead Homie) 
 G's up, ridin' from the cradle to the casket 
 And beyond, recognize thug shit 
 Poundin' out the trunk bitch 
 Runnin' wit' a mother fuckin' hatchet 
 You haters, you suck dick was a thug, became a G 
 B to the L to the A, Z, E, still dead 
 Still don't give a fuck (give a fuck) 
 Sportin' all black kahkis with the mother fuckin' cuffs up 
 Smokin' Hella trees, tryin' to make a couple G's 
 So a thug can get back on his feet 
 Mean muggin', steady thuggin' 
 And I'm tryin' to find the hoodrat's all about fuckin' 
 Still loked out 
 All my dawgs from the past, dead or smoked out 
 Still tryin' to come up on a lick for a phat ass ride 
 So I can drop the top, and parlay through the east side 
 Chorus (Monoxide Child) 
 Niggas kick the anthem like this 
 Juggalos up in this bitch, up in this bitch! x 4 
 (Blaze) 
 Bitches freeze, you ain't a thug or a G or a banga' 
 You's a studio gangsta 
 You ain't about shit, scared to pull the trigga' 
 That's what we call, a real bitch nigga' (bitch nigga') 
 Sneekin' through the hood, throwin' up a set 
 Hangin' out the window, yellin' idol threats 
 Check this out, I'm a check your chin 
 Close your mouth, 'fore I put the barrel in 
 Dumpin' clips in yo ass is what I'm all about 
 Straight G from the clique on a paper route 
 Still slappin' off fake bitches with the Louiville 
 Beat a nigga' to the pavement, another bitch killed 
 Chorus (Monoxide Child) 
 (Jamie Madrox) 
 This is the battle for the planet (booya) 
 We bring the thunder, getting half the advantage 
 From the style and the status 
 Half of y'all coming off a half-ass deal 
 Then got the nerve to tell a muthaphukka "keep it real" 
 We seen through y'all fools like a cellphane on the square pack 
 You buy that shit, you can keep it we don't want it back 
 We don't give a fuck, east side for life 
 And if you don't have heart, don't expect to have your shit tight 
 There ain't no room for the whole-hearted 
 We give a fuck where you at, who you with or how you got started 
 Fuck you and everybody in your clique 
 If you don't run with the hatchet or claim the psychopathic 
 I ain't got time to say no names 
 It's only eight rhymes, yo holla 
 We been in the game 
 'Cause I fuck even speaking your name 
 You're just a bitch in the game 
 And y'all niggaz gonna always be the same
