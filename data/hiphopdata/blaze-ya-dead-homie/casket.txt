In the casket 
 Hell yeah! 
 In the casket 
 In the casket 
 Hell yeah! 
 In the casket 
 In the casket 
 Hell yeah! 
 In the casket 
 In the casket 
 Hell yeah! 
 In the casket 
 Do you wanna know about the box 
 A casket with padlocks 
 Broken off the hinge, bitch, eat a cock 
 Buried in the earth then forgotten about 
 Feelin' good like a mothafucka first day out 
 Took air in my lungs, been awhile since I did so 
 Smoked me a blunt, fucked a hood rat ho 
 Kill a couple niggas, smack a couple bitches 
 Runnin' mothafuckas for the rips and they riches 
 Ain't shit changed but the month and year 
 Broke mothafuckas scrounging for squares and beers 
 Pigs scatter on the street when the dead man arise 
 Real muthafuckin' killas never gon' die 
 In the casket 
 Hell yeah! 
 In the casket 
 In the casket 
 Hell yeah! 
 In the casket 
 In the casket 
 Hell yeah! 
 In the casket 
 In the casket 
 Hell yeah! 
 In the casket 
 Sleepin' in the casket, awoke by a strange sound 
 Break the hinge and rise up from the cold ground 
 I could be deamin', what the fuck is with my head 
 6 feet deep and I'm surrounded by the dead 
 I hear a noise, someone's cryin' my name 
 How should I react, am I just goin' insane? 
 All my thug niggas hold it down on the streets 
 And watch these muthafuckas on they grave robbin' spree 
 Froze in my box, hearin' people chatter up above 
 They sayin' can ya 'kick the do' up?' I'm still stuck 
 I'm dead as shit, I know where I'm at now 
 Chillin' with the dead, one with the underground 
 So why these niggas out fuckin' with my grave? 
 I got a maggot face and my skin's decayed 
 Break through t
