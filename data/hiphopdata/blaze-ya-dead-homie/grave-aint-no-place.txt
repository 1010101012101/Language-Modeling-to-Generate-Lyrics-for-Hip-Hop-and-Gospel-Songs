A motherfucker recognize a thug mashin' hard 
 Straight out the plot of my cemetery yard 
 Buried so long, nobody gave a shit 
 Blood and tears, embedded in my casket 
 Been surrounded, old folks everywhere 
 Smell of dry piss covered the air 
 When I heard the voices say arise from the grave 
 I quickly dug myself out and went to find the 12-gauge 
 Shotgun, double barrelled sawed off pump 
 Safety runs through the target if you test me 
 Psycho thug, mashin' outta control 
 Spent too many fuckin' years deep in a hole 
 But still I'm a killa, feindin' for the streets 
 Slangin' rocks on a 9 to 5 beat 
 All that change, now got maggots on my face 
 I'm back from the dead to give yo ass a taste 
 The grave ain't no place for a psycho thug killa! 
 Hustla on the street, neighborhood drug deala! 
 The grave ain't no place for a psycho thug killa! 
 The grave ain't no place, I should be out mashin! 
 Never goin' back to my muthafuckin' casket! 
 Hustla on the street, neighborhood drug deala! 
 The grave ain't no place, I should be out mashin! 
 Never goin' back to my muthafuckin' casket! 
 The grave ain't no place to be 
 Too much like the penetentary 
 Locked away in concrete 
 I'm buried 6 feet 
 Guess so, so when you roam 
 You can find your way home 
 Cuffs tight around the wrist 'cause I was bustin' my chrome 
 Dark visions in the smog when I walk with the dead 
 Bad dreams in the night keep you shakin' in bed 
 Is it all in your head 'cause you're locked in a cage? 
 And clear your mind and get shanked and live the cemetery way 
 I'm sittin' in the cemetery 
 I got a plan to kill a pig so I placed a phony call about a 
 Bitch I buried 
 Fuck a cell, fuck this call, fuck this shit 
 Peace out bitch!
