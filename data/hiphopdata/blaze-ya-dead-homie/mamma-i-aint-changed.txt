If money means murder mama 
 Murder is tha plan 
 Let it goooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! 
 ( 
 Blaze ya dead homie 
 ) 
 Ever since I remember mama 
 I could neva please u 
 I could neva walk tha path you wanted me 2 
 And I refused 2 listen every time and 
 Watch you scream at the top of ya lungs until you cry 
 Even though I hated it 
 I think back now 2 myself I neva changed it 
 I would steal your bike 
 And I would steal your watch 
 I'd even steal the lawnchairs from your bitch ass porch 
 And thuggin' was my main hobby 
 I bought a 3 8 0 just in case sumbody robbed me 
 Mama mad now 'cause I got heat 
 Pocket full of money new shoes on my feet 
 I even put 500 hundred on that rent 
 But my mama's stubborn ass flush that shit down the toilet 
 (No drug money in this household) 
 That was 500 hundred dollars 
 Damn mama you cold 
 Chorus (not complete) 
 All the winds and tha tides have change 
 Crime will pay 
 And pave the way 
 Lets be real mama I ain't change 
 If money means murder mama 
 Murder is tha plan 
 Let it goooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!(I ain't change) 
 There's a dollar 4 every second inside the day 
 Crime will pave the way 
 Lets be real moma, I ain't changed 
 If money means murda mama 
 Murder is the plan 
 Let it goooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!(I ain't change) 
 ( 
 Blaze ya dead homie

 As I moved up in tha dope game 
 Mama neva changed 
 I would flip 2 bricks a week just 2 maintain 
 She would say that she gon call the Po me 
 Told every1 in my neighborhood that she don't know me 
 Damn mama you ain't right 
 Did you tell 'em how I'm servin' up the baseheads every night 
 And every mornin sleepin' till the pm 
 And hit up the mall to get fresh 4 da weekend 
 That was my American dream 
 Mo' chedda, mo heads, bakin sodas, and triple beams 
 Hoes and Clothes, good weed to toke 
 And artillery to swiss cheese and leave some gun smoke 
 You don't want none, better be ready 
 The lights are on top so when I'm rockin' steady 
 She would cry every time I leave the house, 
 And I wonder why she drunk passed out on the couch 
 Chorus (not complete) 
 All the winds and tha tides have change 
 Crime will pay 
 And pave the way 
 Lets be real mama I ain't change 
 If money means murder mama 
 Murder is tha plan 
 Let it goooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!(I ain't change) 
 There's a dollar 4 every second inside the day 
 Crime will pave the way 
 Lets be real moma, I ain't changed 
 If money means murda mama 
 Murder is the plan 
 Let it goooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!(I ain't change)

 Anybody Killa 
 ) 
 I know I ain't changin, lifes to short 
 All I wanna do is thug, and pay my way outta court 
 Ima always be trippin' on the block, sippin a 40 by the weed spot 
 Back yard BBQ when its hot 
 The whole hood get lippy when they get tipsy 
 I remember moms street fighting like she was back in her 20s 
 I wouldn't change my life for shit 
 And fuck anybody sayin' that I need to quit 
 You ever drove past an enemy and seen him just chillin'? 
 Threw the car in park, and beat him down till he had no feelin' 
 It's a little rough out here 
 When you all alone standin on your own things get so clear 
 Kinda makes you wanna sit back and think for a second 
 Figure out really whos life your wreckin 
 As for me tho, I'm lookin' ahead 
 And I ain't changein so expect more blood to be shed 
 Chorus (not complete) 
 All the winds and tha tides have change 
 Crime will pay 
 And pave the way 
 Lets be real mama I ain't change 
 If money means murder mama 
 Murder is tha plan 
 Let it goooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!(I ain't change) 
 There's a dollar 4 every second inside the day 
 Crime will pave the way 
 Lets be real moma, I ain't changed 
 If money means murda mama
