I represent Southwest, Del-Ray Jefferson 
 Festival ridin', we deemed around the Mexican 
 Me and Violent J, we murder heroin addicts 
 With every different saws, screwdrivers, and automatics 
 I like killin' anybody, I'm like Anybody Killa 
 I'm stompin' through yo' city like a little Godzilla 
 I'll cut ya dick and balls off and make ya eat em' 
 Then choke yo' ass to death so you won't even need em' 
 Punk bitch! 
 You ever felt like you a freak in the night? 
 Outcasted to the shadows 'cause you don't look right 
 Hypnotized by the eyes from the average muthafucka 
 Chrome to his dome, if he cries, he's a busta 
 There's certain rituals for bein' ghetto 
 Keep yo' ass underground, when it's dark, go balistic 
 I'm representin' all the crazy juggalos 
 With a hatchet in they hand, smokin' blunts after shows 
 Think about it, you gotta give it up to Blaze 
 I mean the guy is fuckin' dead in 47 different ways 
 Yet he's leavin' Heaven hangin' 
 And chillin' with his boys 
 At least until they get his room ready in the Nethervoid 
 For now he hits the joint until it ain't none left 
 Which ain't bad for a dead guy supposedly with no breath 
 Death ain't scary, look at Blaze, he's straight 
 Even with the maggots and all, he looks great 
 Because I take out my hatchet and I quickly start axin' 
 I go juggaloco like a crazy assassin 
 Twiztid and the Posse, we say nothing confusing 
 Why? Why? Why? 
 It's just a hatchet execution... 
 A Psychopathic execution 
 Throw it up y'all, lemme see yo' set shinin' 
 Rhymin' 
 For this paper, ain't nothin', get back to grindin' 
 On the Eastside 
 We ride 
 And Drive-By 
 And i
