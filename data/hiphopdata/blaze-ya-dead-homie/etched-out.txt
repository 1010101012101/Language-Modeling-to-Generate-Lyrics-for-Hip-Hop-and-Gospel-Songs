..."What the fuck are you lookin' at?" 
 Which one of y'all wanna get etched out in chalk 
 Better watch how you talk when you talk the talk 
 Better watch how you grip when representing your shit 
 You ain't seeing none of my clique 
 That's for life bitch 
 And that's for life bitch! 
 (And that's for life bitch) 
 And that's for life bitch! 
 (And that'd for life bitch) 
 Better watch how you grip when representing your shit 
 You ain't seeing none of my clique 
 That's for life bitch 
 (Blaze) 
 So know I show up with a shotgun, enough shells to blow holes in err'thing 
 Bloody up the walls, the windows, and the curtains 
 I'm for certain, this sucker right here 
 Gonna die like a bitch motherfucka right here 
 Get that ass chalked up, I'ma trace you 
 Pull out the twelve gauge pencil, and erase you 
 It takes two to tango, so I brought four 
 And in the glove box, shotgun shells galore 
 I came for war, and leaving with a piece of your head 
 So I can look at it, when thinking about that shit that you said 
 Which one of y'all wanna get etched out in chalk 
 Better watch how you talk when you talk the talk 
 Better watch how you grip when representing your shit 
 You ain't seeing none of my clique 
 That's for life bitch 
 And that's for life bitch! 
 (And that's for life bitch) 
 And that's for life bitch! 
 (And that'd for life bitch) 
 Better watch how you grip when representing your shit 
 You ain't seeing none of my clique 
 That's for life bitch 
 I might send you where the bitch motherfuckas, go when they die 
 Fresh out the belt line, with the chrome 4-5 
 Better get to an exit, that vest ain't going help 
 Dump the whole clip, make sure my presence is felt 
 Drive-by! and I ain't got to be in the car 
 I do a drive-by, on a Haro wit no handlebars 
 I do a walk-by, blasting at you out of the blue 
 And what a bitch motherfucka like you gonna do? 
 Which one of y'all wanna get etched out in chalk 
 Better watch how you talk when you talk the talk 
 Better watch how you grip when representing your shit 
 You ain't seeing none of my clique 
 That's for life bitch 
 And that's for life bitch! 
 (And that's for life bitch) 
 And that's for life bitch! 
 (And that'd for life bitch) 
 Better watch how you grip when representing your shit 
 You ain't seeing none of my clique 
 That's for life bitch 
 Now if I unload the heater, I'ma reload the heater 
 And make sure to splatter blood on your khakis and wife beater 
 Y'all bitches ain't leavin' alive 
 When you cross me, you cross the chalk line 
 Now prepare to die 
 People is bleeding, bitches is screaming 
 Suckers running into cars, and driving away speeding 
 I'm in the backpocket looking for chalk to trace 
 The ones who can't walk dead, are trying to crawl away 
 Which one of y'all wanna get etched out in chalk 
 Better watch how you talk when you talk the talk 
 Better watch how you grip when representing your shit 
 You ain't seeing none of my clique 
 That's for life bitch 
 And that's for life bitch! 
 (And that's for life bitch) 
 And that's for life bitch! 
 (And that'd for life bitch) 
 Better watch how you grip when representing your shit 
 You ain't seeing none of my clique 
 That's for life bitch
