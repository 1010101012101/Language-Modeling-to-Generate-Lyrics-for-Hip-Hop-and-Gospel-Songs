I'ma G like the 7th letter in the alphabet 
 My shirt's wet all over a new connect 
 Caught a bullet in my neck and it's spillin' just like a sive 
 Clentch the Glock wonderin' how long I'm gonna live 
 But before I get ahead the story let's start with, 
 The kid we was introduced through a kinda friend 
 My man Ill Money would never lead me astray 
 Real playa he don't fuck with nothing but big weight 
 Put me up on game said the players in town 
 Hold nothing but Afghan twelve hundred a pound 
 At that price I could flip three or maybe four 
 In less than a week through the front and out the back door 
 He says here the numbers and I called the new cat 
 Told 'I'm Money said them L-B-S's lookin' fat 
 I'm lookin' to cop two or thirdies on front 
 Had intents on flippin' two and baggin' the third up 
 And layin' the dude down, and skirtin' with all them pounds 
 And dumpin' a couple rounds, and skippin' a couple towns over 
 When my boy Loc celled to the smoked out 
 Over an inner sight front of the crack house 
 I said I was plannin' the attack, 
 I need a gun man and a Ryda watch my muthafuckin' back 
 'Cause if shit went wack niggas smoke up on me 
 What's up R.O.C. it's ya muthafuckin' homie 
 Seen the thing was I had to roll dude 
 Grab the first burner I'm bout to fall through 
 And bodies gon' go I swear right with me 
 Blaze and R.O.C. make situations sticky 
 Let out whoever's there babies are included 
 We leavin' nothin' breathin' no discussions movin' 
 I won't be seen, cause all they see is the flash from my barrel 
 Fuck a penitentary, hand steady 160 cock me 
 Cops can't stop me, fuck I'm gettin' sloppy 
 Break a lil' bit cross the front of the bitch 
 Start gunnin' when I pass 'em no aces ditched 
 While the silencer's silencin' all that's involved 
 We about to get paid ain't no time to stall 
 Attempts to catch the bead of sweat drippin' down my face 
 Burns my eye a lil' bit but my aim is straight 
 I can see it goin' down 
 Ill connect 
 It's bout to happen right now 
 Ill connect 
 Rob that boy for them pounds 
 Ill connect 
 I like the way that sounds 
 Ill connect 
 It might come back around 
 Ill connect 
 I want the muthafuckin' crown 
 Ill connect 
 Them bodies bound to be found 
 Ill connect 
 I put 'em deep in the ground 
 Ill connect 
 Shit went bad, there was undercover cops 
 I shot, he shot, and R.O.C. popped 
 One of his boys in the neck and it got worse 
 Overhead was the sirens and the sounds of the ghetto bird 
 I had a coupla holes in my chest like a golf course 
 And I'm reloadin' the rounds for the I-4 task force 
 And canine units that tried to subdue us 
 Plenty of ammunition I;m lookin' to get ruthless 
 Takin' shelter behind the side door 
 Amidst the gun battle I drop a few more 
 So many shells hit the ground and mixed with my blood 
 It's dust clouds and gun powder and heat above 
 Time ticks and the second hand fly pass 
 The streets is riddled with blood and gun blasts 
 And the final shot that fatally struck me 
 An who the fuck are they kidding ain't no killin' Ya Dead Homie
