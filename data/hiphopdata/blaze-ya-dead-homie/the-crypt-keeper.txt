"You should not have come here. your not welcome here. this place is for the dead." 
 They call me the crypt keeper in charge of the netherworlds 
 Death valley is made up of skeletons and spoken words 
 Vultures fly by like ghetto birds and pick flesh from bones 
 While they melt in the sun like ice cream cones the dead zone 
 Absorb'em until it rains brimstone and hot lava melt away puppet strings 
 Got a thousand of 'em waiting to jump if I give the word 
 And drag you down in the crypt without a care or concern 
 I hold the hour glass which means my word is my bond 
 And if your name appear on my list it' you I will be creepin' on 
 Of should I say encryptin no I'm not trippin' I pause for a second 
 To reload my weapon and blast 
 You fucking with the crypt keeper you fucked up now bitch 'cause I here to see ya 
 You fucking with the crypt keeper you fucked up now bitch 'cause I here to see ya 
 (The sun is falling and it's raining blood the deadman has returned to your neighborhood) 
 And you know I'm bout to blast break backs, cut throats, bullet holes, gun smoke 
 Don't you know bitch motherfucker I'm a lay you down 
 And you know I'm bout to blast break backs, cut throats, bullet holes, gun smoke 
 Don't you know bitch motherfucker I'm a lay you down 
 You fucking with the crypt keeper you fucked up now bitch 'cause I here to see ya 
 You fucking with the crypt keeper you fucked up now bitch 'cause I here to see ya 
 (The sun is falling and it's raining blood the deadman has returned to your neighborhood 
 Pour out some liquor and bow your head and show respect to the motherfuckin dead
