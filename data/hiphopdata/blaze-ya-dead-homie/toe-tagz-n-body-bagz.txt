 Toe tagz body bagz (x3) 
 (Blaze:) 
 Toe tagz body bagz dead body cold slab embalm the body after the autopsy 
 No blood just formaldehyde the outcome of homicide or suicide pine box 
 Dressed in ya Sunday best got a single white rose layin off on ya chest 
 Close the open casket ain't no coming back like a ticket paid be it coach or first class 
 Like a trip to the otherside soaked in all black time to face facts layin flat on my dead back 
 I flip dat call it all a mishap then bag up ya body with tagz so they don't mismatch 
 Toe tagz body bagz zip yo ass up in a bag toe tagz body bagz put you on a cold slab 
 Toe tagz body bagz zip yo ass up in a bag toe tagz body bagz put you on a cold slab

 Tag'em and bag'em and drag'em in to the underground 
 Collect preserve use discretion never make a sound 
 Floor boards squeak but the dead don't speak 
 They marinate in the fruit celler for up to 3 weeks 
 Till they're ripe for pickin' and they get plucked and tucked 
 Between the walls like insulation where they remain stuck 
 Forced to listen to other victims getting the same cause the artist is consistent 
 So it's performed the same way

 Hefty cinch sak 50 gallon or more available in any home improvement or grocery store 
 I buy'em by the pallette and fill my trunk with dead bodies 3 fat 2 skinny old men and stacked hotties 
 I tag'em on the toe so only I will know how I killed'em and what they came here for 
 Got so many got a library a through z all buried beneath the lights of my H-O-M-E

 Linda and Larry and Lori we got most of the L's 
 20 or 30 or more as we dig in to hell 
 Tunnels and caverns underneath the apolled 
 Deeper in the ground so the body remains cold 
 With copies of toe tagz man I treat' it like a recipt 
 There's a copy for you copy for me customer policy 
 I run a business and this hobbies not a game 
 Show passion for the art normal people would call insane 
 Big silva duck tape toe tagz dead weight 
 2 on da porch 1 more in the crawl space with no face 
 Looking at me but I hear'em at night 
 Crawlin through the walls trying to rob me of my own life
