Who wanna ride?! 
 Who wanna ride?! 
 Who wanna ride?! 
 It's a Saturday afternoon on the Eastside 
 Mashin' in the bucket, sippin' on formeldahyde 
 Pockets lookin' sore so you know I gotta go 
 Pull a 2-11 on the neighborhood sto' 
 Mash on the gas, then I hit the pavement 
 Jumped out the bucket, headed straight in 
 Told the fuckin' clerk, put the money on the table 
 I'm a lunatic and my mind is unstable 
 He stuttered like a bitch 
 Tryin' to stop the hit 
 Shakin' like a twig 
 So you know I dumped the clip! 
 16 shots left his body on the flo' 
 Break the register, took the money, and I broke 
 Out the fuckin' back do' straight to the bucket 
 Put the money in, start the ride, and I punch it 
 Been from the hood, straight shots in the daylight 
 A normal Saturday for Blaze on the Eastside 
 Every Saturday afternoon! 
 (Who wanna ride?!) 
 I go robbin' these bitches and hoes! 
 (Who wanna ride?!) 
 Every Saturday afternoon! 
 (Who wanna ride?!) 
 I go robbin' these bitches and hoes! 
 Headed on back the crib to count my dough 
 Got 200 dollars and I'm lookin' for mo' 
 'Cause I'm greedy and I'm back on the streets 
 Rollin' through the hood, to another store I creep 
 Now I'm on my feet 'cause the cops is on my tail 
 They wanna see me go to jail with no bail 
 But they can't 'cause I'm rockin' a hoodie 
 A .45 cal. in my waist, so don't push me 
 Same Saturday, still hittin' licks for cash 
 Walked into Carlins, demanded all his stash 
 The sucka talked shit, but filled the bag up 
 Guess he thought his homie in the back was gonna tag him 
 Blaze, and he came out from the back room 
 Runnin' at a dead homie, Blaze, with a broom
