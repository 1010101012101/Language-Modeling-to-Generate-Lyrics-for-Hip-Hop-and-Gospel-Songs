 I'm the greatest escape artist the hardest situation is getting free 
 From the terror that keeps confiding in me, 
 I got to be Better than Houdini and David Blaine 
 With no magician, No illusions, No subliminal, No hypnosis to your brain, I'm untrained 
 Children should not try this at home at all, I'm a free lance professional 
 And this is on my own I staged the whole bit 
 I drink and talk a little shit and see who got the balls to pull a strap 
 And really use it, That's where the fun comes in 
 Cause after they pop me they got to hide my body 
 So no one's suspicious about who shoot me 
 It's interesting me to see the means and the tactics and tape 
 To make sure that my death is tucked away nice and safe

 Sunshines for suckers and queers 
 That's what they told me when they rolled me in the carpet, 
 And through me over the bridge just like I was some garbage 
 Of course I was unconscious not dead in the sense they thought I was 
 But a slug in your dome will get you caught up cause 
 I'm not invincible I could die a million times 
 Each time more painful than the first, Still I survive 
 Both hands are tide behind my back as I'm breathing dirty water 
 And my legs are been mauled to death by the sewer rats 
 I move erratically to make them work for there meal 
 I'm dislocating my shoulders I slip out just like banana peel 
 I'm close to drowning again 
 Ten minutes and counting me to them 
 Is my record so I feel it like I'm ahead 
 In points was the view from the west but it's all good 
 Best believe that your boy will be back to walk the neighborhood 
 In no time water logged and bullet ridden 
 They be like, I can't believe that he did it, He really escaped.?

 No stun, I'm running with some gangstas 
 Not no bitchass wangstas 
 But some real gangsta fed my legs into a woodchipper 
 But the blades got caught on my bones 'cause I woke up screaming 
 And noticed that my right foot and... leg was gone 
 My eye popped out the socket and dangling on the cheek 
 They must have strangled me to sleep 'cause I'm unable to speak 
 Must have screamed just inside of my head 
 'Cause they still think that I'm dead 
 They using a shovel to scrape away clumps of the red 
 From out the chipper they pop my legs out 
 So they can chop me up manual bag me up and throw me out 
 No sweat, give me a week and a roll of some duct tape 
 And a shovel to dig the rest of my body up and I'm straight
