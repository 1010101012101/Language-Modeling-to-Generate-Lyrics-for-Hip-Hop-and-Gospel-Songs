They say oh well, It's still a good day 
 They say oh well, It's still a good day 
 They Say oh well, It's still a good day 
 They say oh well, It's still a good day 
 Another day in this world system, still tripping 
 Why did I expect any thing different 
 Save whales, save dogs, save dolphins 
 Save trees Kids ain't really that important 
 See signs of a genocide we keep silent 
 But for some land and oil we get violent 
 All I hear is less faith more science 
 If it feels good to you then try it 
 The sex addicted make kids porn victims 
 Bloods shed blood, crips set tripping 
 Young girls watch video and live reckless 
 Give up their virginity, all for a necklace 
 My man was driven he was sitting on wisdom 
 But he traded that in for some rims that spinning 
 He got 26's but the rent he can't pay 
 He's like oh well its still a good day 
 I saw an old friend, who I meet back in school 
 We wasted our lives, we were way to cool 
 He told his story, then I shared mine 
 Come to find he hasn't changed much since 99 
 He's one of those IF brothers you've meet before 
 If I had this or if I wasn't poor 
 If I had money I'd open a store 
 If he probably cared at all he'd probably more 
 All the money he wants can't buy joy 
 Dollar bills don't make men out of boys 
 Money can't buy him love but it buys stripper 
 It can't fix his wrongs but it buys liquor 
 I might become an old man with a bad liver 
 I've been drinking for years and I hate to be a quitter 
 My pops sold drugs, momma was an alchy 
 So when I got old I was pretty sure what I'll be 
 An aimless soul, struggling to cope 
 Govt selling us hope but giving us rope 
 To hang myself so I die a little everyday 
 But he's like oh well it's still a good day 
 I'm far from perfect so I know the LORD's worth 
 Even on holiday you know the LORD works 
 Outside of Christmas I'll rap in his name 
 Jokers mad at me, I don't this for fame 
 I will not sell my soul trying to make it in the game 
 Most of these rappers content stay lame 
 There's good rappers but our music not the same 
 They rap for the dollars I rap for the change 
 I don't do this for the selfish gain- homie 
 He went Autotune when he took the T-pain homie 
 Pull over you in the wrong lane homie 
 I swear it read HOV only 
 I ain't talking about roc, I'm talking about roc 
 Watch that sky drop, And you can get it bro 
 I guess what I'm trying to say 
 Oh Well... it's NOT a good day
