What caused the death of the mighty lion? 
 I don't hear him roar, what's the reason for? 
 What caused the death of the mighty lion? 
 Once he hits the floor, there will be no more. 
 The Lions dying and he trying to graps for the air 
 It's no longer there, and it seems like no body cares 
 He fumbles and stumbles he tripping he up and he down 
 It's a miracle if he doesn't return to the ground 
 He's hit a bump or it seems more like he's stuck 
 They wont help him up so it seems like he lost their trust 
 The harvest will come but by then he'll return to the dust 
 Most look pleased with the death, but that just spells misfortune for us 
 The one hope for the world is now dead and he's gone 
 We've made some clones, but none with a roar that'll frighten your bones 
 He's wearing a muzzle, no longer the king of the jungle 
 The cowards have killed him; they've taken his roar and his rumble 
 They're few that will cry with fear that extinction will rise 
 Apart from their pride they just want to lay down and die 
 We cheered for his death, as if the world wasn't darkened enough 
 We got what we want so I guess this is a caution to us 
 Extinction, or fleeing, receiving the taming procedure 
 Rapid decreasing, disguise pretend to be zebras 
 What you believe in, or better what's your reason for breathing 
 Bowing with Caesar, or is it allegiance to Jesus 
 Where my fighters at ready to oppose the liars 
 Not afraid to shun evil that a passion people 
 They put us cages w hopes that this scares us or changes 
 We cause them danger so now they result back with anger 
 The shooting of Luther, the shooting of Kennedy 
 If your roars too loud this is the remedy for their enemies 
 There's a problem we tend to be afraid to be brave 
 I'd rather head to the grave than live my life as a slave 
 I know its easy to say, but it's the words that I pray 
 If I'm crazy for something, then its gotta be all in or nothing 
 But there's a rumor buzzing you can hear hearts thumping 
 I guess there's more Lions and a revolutions coming
