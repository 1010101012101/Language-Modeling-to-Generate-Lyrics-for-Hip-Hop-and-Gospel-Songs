RUN IT with us, or you can hate me 
 But it'll be hard to shut us down 
 Okay, Call your man, call your girl, tell them all to call their bluff 
 Tell them call the stations and ask them why they hate on us 
 Took an ouch for His people just so He can stay in touch 
 Check the record books it's better off you run with us 
 Call us punks, call us weak, call us chumps, call us dumb 
 Call the verizon network and still see it's not enough 
 On the cable on the web, on the phone they call us wack 
 Go ahead and try to shut us down, ain't no app for that 
 RUN IT with us, or you can hate me 
 But it'll be hard to shut us down 
 Listen, I write to tell the truth, don't write to save face 
 Born in H-town, got the words to save face 
 Christian means that when I eat the meat I say my grace 
 If only God could judge you how you plan to beat the case 
 Can't beat it, mike jack, couldn't neither it 
 All you get is one life, can't rewind or repeat it 
 I will do this till the day I take my last breath 
 Beautiful feet I'm running till I take my last step 
 There's nothing they can do to stop what the Lord's doing 
 Come in the kitchen, take a look at what the Lord's brewing 
 Radio don't play us, television mock us 
 The truth is still spreading, there's no way they can stop us 
 Pharisees throw stones at my glass house 
 But they don't see they own reflection when they bad mouth 
 You can lie, you can hate, you can run us down 
 But in the end, the gates of Hell couldn't shut us down 
 RUN IT with us, or you can hate me 
 But it'll be hard to shut us down 
 Some think we're a mess some calling us blessed 
 A mic and a stage don't always equal success 
 Sometimes a bigger platform only brings stress 
 I watch my life and doctrine and pray for the best 
 AT told me let your light shine homes 
 Even if they wanna see you crash like Dow Jones 
 It's like Matt 16 who can come against it 
 You can be a Pharisee or you can be a witness 
 If we stay in the church the world calls us religious 
 If we go on mtv, the saints think were trippin' 
 If we try to hit the streets then we're some thugs in sin 
 With those spectatin' you can't expect to win 
 It's hard to make decisions when theory's clouded your vision 
 Sometimes I'm confused with who is my opposition 
 I think I heard cheers when I fumbled the ball 
 They claim they're on our team but praying for our fall
