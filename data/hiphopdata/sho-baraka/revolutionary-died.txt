I got some tragic news today 
 Real manhood has died, they say 
 But you can wipe your tears away 
 A Revolution is formed another will be born 
 I got some tragic news today 
 Real manhood has died, they say 
 But you can wipe your tears away 
 A new one is born so bring in the song 
 I am changed escapin' my old ways 
 Harriet Tubman on that underground train 
 Too many men see the grave misinterpreting brave 
 I could loose those chains if they knew they were slaves 
 I thought a man was a pimp at a young age 
 Now I try to honor women when the pen hits the page 
 Its still hip-hop minus all the thuggin' 
 Take the poet and priest and put it in a husband 
 Not boasting I'm far from perfect 
 I'm just saying give the title to some cats who deserve it 
 I know some men earned it 
 Some strong role models who knows GOD's purpose 
 I know one song can't change the world 
 But maybe dude next door'll stop beatin' his girl 
 And maybe we can get some brothas out trap 
 I just wanna change my block we'll see what happens after that 
 My cuzzo like I can make that dollar pretty quick 
 Illegal stuff, I tell him he should work for it 
 He looked me up down and stuck his mouth to the side 
 Like c'mon you know you done I lost my mind 
 He wants High Living but was forced in the basement 
 Lets face it this is what racism has created 
 I told my dog you'll never catch the car don't chase it 
 So many kill themselves in world trying to make it 
 Your appetite will eat you when you get a chance to taste it 
 Their cups look full, but their lives look Wasted 
 A fully furnished house but your soul feels vacant 
 Get some new thngs but feel the need to replace it 
 Yeah, this is man's ordeal 
 Decorate his frame to make himself feel real 
 Or rob, steal, kill 
 Any emotion is good as long as I feel 
 No sir that's ain't what manhood is 
 Life without morals and fruitless end 
 I took him under my wing now the journey begin 
 Hopefully another man can be born again 
 This cat asking me how many shawties I tap 
 I know you get a lot of play even in gospel rap 
 I wasn't too shocked if my discernments was right 
 He type that hasn't seen a brother honor his wife 
 So instead of calling him stupid and causing a fight 
 Just explained to this brother things I value in life 
 He confused 'cause he said you don't look like the type 
 That really lives all the stuff that you say on the mic 
 He's doubting my words like he needs some proof 
 Plus he struggles with the idea of absolute truth 
 He won't practice those things which he don't esteem 
 If he hates absolute truth then he's the Supreme being 
 Then he has no standards, then he has no answers 
 So his contributions in life is just prostate cancer 
 I try to answer every question that he throws my way 
 Hopefully another real man will be born today
