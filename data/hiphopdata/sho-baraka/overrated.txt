Ladies and gentleman, please stand to your feet for Sho Baraka's rendition of "Overrated"! 
 Look at the state of the world 
 Yeah, I'm mad at the world 
 And I'ma share my frustration just a little bit. 
 Every brother is a thug 
 And while they glorifying drugs, 
 They look at me bugged 
 'Cause I wanna be a gentlemen. 
 And my ladies are a mess 
 They want value in their dress 
 And in themselves they don't invest 
 They want significance. 
 The young'uns quote 50 cent, 
 But can't count to 50 cent. 
 We promote ignorance 
 And we're so illiterate. 
 My Man loving that money to death 
 Really to death 
 He'll kill himself to get him a check. 
 Oh, but he weeped about Virginia tech, 
 But he sells glocks and tech 
 Please help me understand his intellect. 
 We can talk about taxes and air pollution 
 Government's great illusion, 
 But that's makeup for the skin. 
 And I don't wanna give problems without solutions 
 So I've come to this conclusion 
 Love God and hate sin. 
 The money (the money) 
 The power (the power) 
 The fame (the fame) 
 The lies and the games 
 It's all (it's all) 
 It's all (it's all) 
 It's all (it's all) 
 Overrated! 
 The lust (the lust) 
 The pride (the pride) 
 The greed (the greed) 
 Anything to succeed 
 It's all (it's all) 
 It's all (it's all) 
 It's all (it's all) 
 Overrated! 
 This cat was like I don't feel you to be honest 
 You should sound more street, more hood, more conscious. 
 And also be more liberal with your content, 
 He wanna make me a star, so I can fall like a comet. 
 I'm satisfied with the things that God promised. 
 I don't need to chase the steak when I'm cool with top ramen. 
 I'm a servant of the King; I pay homage. 
 I don't wanna be on top, if they put Him at the bottom 
 "Sho you just faking to be humble and poor, 
 In hopes that the LORD will be pleased and bless you with more." 
 No, homie, I just keep my face to the floor 
 When he opens the door, my views will be the same as before. 
 I can't be real commercial with it. 
 Non-offensive lyrics, get some radio spins, and give them Jesus later. 
 I wanna walk like the Lord, and talk like the Lord. 
 If we live like the lord, then the world will hate us. 
 The clothes (the clothes) 
 The sex (the sex) 
 The cars (the cars) 
 Anything to be stars 
 It's all (it's all) 
 It's all (it's all) 
 It's all (it's all) 
 Overrated! 
 The rage (the rage) 
 The hate (the hate) 
 The drugs (the drugs) 
 Everybody is a thug 
 It's all (it's all) 
 It's all (it's all) 
 It's all (it's all) 
 Overrated! 
 It could be hard righteous living, 
 With the freedom God has given, 
 But we can live in the world and keep our sanity. 
 You might one day be a star, 
 Even drive a fancy car, 
 But realize, my friend, it's all vanity. 
 It's the heart at question, who has your affections 
 Is it the goods you love or the GOD who made them? 
 So for my last suggestion, 
 If we've learned any lesson, 
 The world's lost the game - its overrated 
 The what (the what) 
 The who (the who) 
 The things (the things) 
 The rat race for the green 
 It's all (it's all) 
 It's all (it's all) 
 It's all (it's all) 
 Overrated! 
 The oh (the oh) 
 The ooh (the ooh) 
 The ah (the ah) 
 The blas√© blah 
 It's all (it's all) 
 It's all (it's all) 
 It's all (it's all) 
 Overrated! 
 The cash (the cash) 
 The cream (the cream) 
 The diamonds (the diamonds) 
 Pretty much everything 
 It's all (it's all) 
 It's all (it's all) 
 It's all (it's all) 
 It's overrated 
 Yeah, recognize Christ is the real champion 
 Surrender your life to Him 
 He'll bring your life real value
