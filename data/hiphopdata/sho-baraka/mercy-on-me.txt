Lord, Lord you know I tried 
 When I should have been strong I cried 
 When I should have helped I walked on by 
 When I should have told the truth I straight up lied 
 I know your love has set me free 
 But I keep on putting you back on that tree 
 Oh Lord, Have your mercy on me 
 Loving father put your grace on me, on me 
 Put Grace on me, on me 
 Put Grace on me, on me 
 Put Grace on me, on me 
 Loving Father 
 Put your Mercy on me, on me 
 Put your Mercy on me, on me 
 Put your Mercy on me, on me 
 Loving Father 
 Put your Mercy on me, on me 
 Tre's nerves are bubbling, juggling jobs, avoid hustling 
 Hard trusting in God- because now he's struggling 
 TV's throwing lust at him, Corners boys punking him 
 Wife wants to fuss with him, LORD keep touching him 
 He might return to street life, But he'll fight will all he can 
 'Cause if they test him again, He would hate to have kill a man 
 The pressure he can't handle it, he's lost ways to channel it 
 He might black out, then he ends up back in anger management 
 His common problem is his values aren't- matching his wallet 
 He's praying but still jobless, his faith used to keep him honest 
 He's got visions of bad decisions that are void of the godly wisdom 
 So this one bad decision will most likely land him in prison 
 So a week from now, He'll be at a bank in town 
 He'll be yelling get down, with some other clowns, waving a gun around 
 He'll succeed ducking the cops and leaving with profits 
 But he'll have problems dodging all the guilt that's working on his conscience 
 Jane's feeling the pain, like razors are in her vein 
 Last year the cancer came, and now her life has changed 
 Chemo and pain killers, the disdain gets realer 
 Her Hope becomes thinner, from all the news that they give her 
 She taking the news with caution, 'cause she knows the Lord is awesome 
 But often she pauses, of the losses and of what death cost us 
 Is it worth fighting she nauseous, plus the hospital charges 
 She's heard there's light in the tunnel but all she sees is Darkness 
 No one is feeling her burden, they just keep giving her sermons 
 If they listened with more discernment, they could tell that she's hurting 
 Her speech is just an illusion, she's scared of the end conclusion 
 If she shares her doubt- she feels her image may be ruined 
 She's holding her fears in, tears in, She'll be dead by years end 
 She's not thinking through how God forgives sins 
 Until then her nights are long, as she is faking strong 
 In the corner of her heart, This will be her song, sing 
 How often we go through the motions, up and down rollercoasting 
 Scared to admit were hurting, nervous thoughts of perversion 
 This culture we've built is perfect, were saying his death was worthless 
 Not to concerned with His worship as along as we do our churchin 
 We're decorating our person, just to continue lies 
 Or shortcomings we hide is with a shallow disguise 
 To prove we got it together, to make it seem like were better 
 Than friends, fam, whoever, we take some extreme measures 
 We have a desire to add, to the grace that we have 
 We're never content with our lives, we operate in pride 
 We hate to seem dependent, but that's the way that He intended 
 Humans made in His image, built to live in the tension 
 Learn wisdom, we were distant his love we didn't deserve it 
 We confess that we're worthless, then break our backs to earn it 
 Without you I'm, helpless, weak, my existence is bleak 
 I refuse to proceed without Your grace and mercy on me
