 Naw, naw, naw 
 I'm black because I was told I have a slave masters last name and I shouldn't eat swine because it's the white man's animal. 
 I'm black because I wear jeans that let my underwear breathe and I desire a cuff that falls right off my boots.

 Propagated by society

 Distorted as this world's perception may be 
 Who I am and what I am thank God because... I'm black.
