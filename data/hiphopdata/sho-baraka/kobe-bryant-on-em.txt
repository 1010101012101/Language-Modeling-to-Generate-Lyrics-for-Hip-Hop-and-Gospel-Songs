Big Lion shout to my mellow, my saint K-Drama man, What's good? 
 Now this song is ridiculous man, continue to serve the Lord with your gifting but 
 You know your boy had to correct you on one thing right! 
 Opposition in my face, I'm try to play 'fence 
 I'm bigger than this dude that don't make no sense 
 I Kobe Bryant on 'em (Aye!) 
 I Kobe Bryant on 'em (Aye!) 
 I Kobe Bryant on 'em (Aye!) 
 I Kobe Bryant on 'em (Aye!) 
 Opposition in my face, yeah I Kobe Bryant on 'em 
 Body slam my flesh, Andre the Giant on 'em 
 When life throws you curve balls like Nolan Ryan on 'em 
 Don't give up in the field, Detroit Lions on 'em 
 His foes gave Christ the cross, he wasn't dyin' on 'em 
 He still extends love to those who would be lyin' on 'em 
 Gotta offer my service, yeah your boy's wilin'on 'em 
 That's why I pack a punch in my lyrics, yeah I'm stylin' on 'em 
 Sin and lust no laughin' matter, no joke on 'em 
 That's why I run from temptation, Usain Bolt on 'em 
 But there I go celebrating before the finish line 
 I find myself repenting again, for my pride 
 I got that 4 by 4 community, pass the sticks on 'em 
 I hope I can depend on my dogs, Mike Vick on 'em 
 I wanna be free from slavery, Kunta Kinte on 'em 
 And just please the master, Daniel Son and Sensei on 'em

 I'm tryin' to deliver the word, Bill Gates on 'em 
 But they worried about themselves, MySpace on 'em 
 I haunted by the truth where even church goin' youth 
 Just wanna root for the thug in the thousand dollar suits 
 'Cause he looks fly, and he's got a lot of swagger on 'em 
 But he's gonna die, yeah pull out the casket for 'em 
 Then he stands before the throne, Judge Judy on 'em 
 Then you see your life was mishandled and unruly on 'em 
 Then realize you missed the bus, Kris Kross on 'em

 Now I'm runnin' scared 'cause my friends, police was blowin' sirens on 'em 
 But I was picked from high school, I Kobe Bryant on 'em 
 Yeah we talkin' NBA but I feel more like the N.F.L. 
 'Cause I found that new found love, that's Da Truth Emmanuel 
 The lamb hurt for my sins, no longer ?urt for my friends, 
 No longer work for the ends, last clerk to leave the gym 
 'Cause the Lord is like the glass, you can always bank on 
 I like to jump over Kane and Knights and straight rank on 'em 
 I hit the J's at the buzzer in this game of Jeopardy 
 Causing the world to stay away from me, like I got leprosy 
 I used to run with 8, now I'm runnin' 24 
 Used to be luke warm, now I'm full time for the Lord 
 To my defense I;m still in that 2-3 zone 
 Keep it old school like 45's of Warwick Dionne 
 Kids find the winners too, Romans 13 on 'em 
 We are the champions, Rock Band, Queen on 'em 
 Opposition in my face, I'm try to play 'fence

 If you ever hear this Tracy, man I love you, may the Lord's grace be with you 
 I'm just a Laker man, you know what I'm sayin' 
 Cali through and through, you know what I'm sayin' IE what up! 
 K-Drama man I love you dog... haha
