(GOD is like) 
 Perfect in all his ways you come broke and he'll fix you today 
 (GOD is like) 
 The peace in the midst of the storm you're going crazy he'll give you a calm 
 (GOD is like) 
 The man who says that gain is lost but man would say that this is totally false/ false like the way we merchandise his act on the cross 'cause man waters it down and exploits it for cost 
 (GOD is like) 
 Sovereign and majestic king ask Kirk he's the reason why I sing 
 (GOD is like) 
 He who make Pharaoh a mighty man then humbles him just to show that he can 
 (GOD is like) 
 A loving father who extends love to a man who just mutilated and killed his son 
 (GOD is like) 
 Forgiver, protector, light, mighty, way, truth, the life, 
 (GOD is like) 
 Sweet like cinnamon, something like a lifeguard 'cause he really can save a man 
 (GOD is like) 
 Not like, he is love he's no like us, who is like GOD who can we trust. 
 Who Is Like GOD

 He's the foundation layer architect of the earth 
 Determined my end but he predestined me first 
 Perfect fellowship with man then man got the curse 
 But then he gave himself he prepared for the worse 
 He's got a monopoly in his line of work 
 Who else you know can make a grown man from the dirt 
 Be careful what you say 'cause the saints stay packing 
 66 bullets 2 clips in 1 cannon 
 We track stars on his team and Jesus is the captain 
 He put us in a race so we run like what's happening 
 He got mansions all in the sky he ain't lonely 
 He don't need no earthly shack he ain't Kobe 
 He's the real Ace in the deck the rest phony 
 These other jokers just want to jack the king homie 
 Who is like our GOD he's just so holy 
 Mom said put him first but I make him one and only 
 Who is like the Son you? You can test if you want 
 But the odds of finding one are like infinite to none 
 Trying to measure up to God, We all impotent and dumb 
 He rejects the strong and proud and lifts up the humble ones 
 So how I sound braggin' like I'm the best 
 No Christ in my life At best I'm powerless 
 When it comes to Yeshua, (Yup!) I'm impressed 
 Cause He rose like the Phoenix Got up and conquered death 
 He's the real King Pin He alone holds the throne 
 Exercisin' perfect Justice In a League of His own 
 He's the heavyweight champ and still undefeated 
 Quit searchin' for weakness Ain't nobody like Jesus 
 Stretched His arms like elastic to save us from the casket 
 Forget Reed Richards, Elyon is Fantastic 
 He Flames On like John Storm Swings da hammer like Thor 
 My Hero's El-Gibor Cause ain't nobody like the Lord 
 (Let me set the record straight) 
 I'm asking can you fathom this trinitarian tandem 
 Or imagine the thousands of atoms it took to make Adam 
 Who is like GOD cause HE HIMSELF is high 
 We try to do it but Ah! were left with me, myself and I 
 Please believe HE'S on the throne while we do it to death 
 I'm relieved HE'S number one cause number two is a mess 
 Queen or Bishop it's best I get this mess off my chest 
 We're Rooks and Pawns next to the KING plus HE'S got us in check 
 (If I ruled the world) you can stop trying 
 You're hov you're the soveriegn ruler man stop lying 
 How you use the name hova and don't know who the KING be 
 HE says walk this way and HE runs the emcee 
 HE'S the KING and ROCK there is none higher 
 Forget the bling and the block or burn in the lake of fire 
 (JESUS) the only known to wake go and fold HIS grave clothes 
 Went and told displayes HIS holes then raise like case closed!
