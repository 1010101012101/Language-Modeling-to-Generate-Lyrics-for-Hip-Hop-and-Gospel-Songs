 And when you notice your condition, 
 Maybe you'll want to stay with me. yeah, yeah, yeah.

 The answer's here, right here with me. 
 Row, row, row your boat ... 
 Row, row, row your boat ... 
 Row, row, row your boat ... 
 Repeated in rounds -- 12 measures total 
 I want the world to know my reason. 
 And, if you help me find a way, yeah, yeah, yeah, 
 I'll bring my own and keep on pleasin'. 
 But, baby, this is the way I'm gonna' stay.
