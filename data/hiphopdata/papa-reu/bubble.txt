It's about that time 
 Yeah, new shit (new shit) 
 Know that know that uh uh 
 Papa reu, hot shit ah ah ah 
 I like that, I like that 
 Its reu's time to shine 
 Right in florida and Texas sit lay back and recline 
 As you prepare to see 
 From then to now all the g's are bout to release 
 All because they know 
 When reu now play this joke but it's not papas joke 
 When you skank a ride at night
