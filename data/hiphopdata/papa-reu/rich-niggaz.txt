 Cash Money 
 Rich Niggas 
 Look 
 Loud pipes big rims 
 Nigga that's my life 
 As I pull up at the club 
 Sorry that's my knife 
 I know a lot of haters probably saying that that's not right 
 Well my diamonds so much bigger 
 So that's my life 
 Bling bling 
 Now only carry big face and you hear the ching ching 
 Now you can ask your wife and she will say the same thing 
 And your children be amazed when they see me on the big screen 
 Ha, ha, ha 
 I crack myself up 
 I know I talk lot but I can back myself up 
 Got a little house on the beach that's where I shack myself up 
 You ain't really got more money than me 
 Think about it 
 Let's just say somebody gave me a check to think about it 
 So I just bought a new Rollie and got to take a link up out it 
 And even though ice is like a Prince concert that ain't crowded 
 They see the Beam, and the truck, and the V-12 
 And we was next 
 Then that's when I pull up in the B-E-L 
 Le-Le-Lex 
 Ha 
 I'm on fire 
 Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot 
 We on fire 
 Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot 
 Juvenile I used to be 
 R-E-T-A bound 
 Now I be busting these bitches when I come around 
 Acting like a nigga that ain't never had shit 
 Look into my bed saying that's a mad hit 
 I'll damned if these diamonds and golds ain't shining 
 My Rollie ain't rinning 
 My bank and climbing 
 You looking at a multi-millionaire in the flesh 
 Might don't have it now, but I just got me a check 
 I can walk it like I talk it 
 Play it how I say it 
 Teach it like I preach it 
 Now, put that in your head 
 Nigga, bet a thousand, shoot a thousand-ain't nothing 
 Smoke a pound, pop the crystal and drink something 
 Meet me in the casino 
 Way in the back 
 Using money like a motherfucker 
 Still shooting crack 
 Tomorrow I'll be back 
 I got millionaire status 
 We make so much money IRS be looking at us 
 I got more ends than Bonnie have in a factory 
 I'm Lil Turk, I'm living large, got the baddest hoes after me 
 Picture me, a young nigga bawling out of control 
 Playing with millions, laying in condos 
 Nigga I shine, shine through the fucking week 
 The fliest ride with crystal in the passenger seat 
 Don't hate me, 'cause I'm a little bawler 
 Got more weight than Angola 
 Fucking your girl Carla 
 Nigga I stunt, 
 And I'm a stunt till I can't no more 
 Chest lit up like the oaks 
 From the diamonds I sport 
 Yo, I can't be touched 
 Don't think I'm too much, nigga I'm rich what the fuck 
 Rolex crushed out with the bezel 
 And all the foes that get close to me got to be on my schedule 
 I got so much money 
 I don't know what to do 
 Buy isles and cars 
 And break bread with my crew 
 I'm on fire 
 Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot 
 We on fire 
 Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot 
 B.G. on fire 
 Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot 
 Uh, uh, uh 
 Hear me 
 It's like, monkey see, monkey do 
 Rolling with the Cash Money Runners I stay true 
 'Cause when were running and climbing on the million-dollar scene 
 Holding together, know what I mean, know what I mean 
 When I bring out the rubber around the Hummer 
 Followed by the Benz, or in the Lex Bubble 
 When I start they said I had no fame 
 Now all the girls just end up calling my name 
 Ten G's to call me 
 Fax the contract to big Cash Money 
 Cause you know this whole clique right with me 
 They're right with me 
 Sip-pe-di-dy 
 Won't count the diamonds just around my neck 
 "X" amount-a dollars on a bankroll check 
 If you want to really come and see ruby 
 Those that got me wicked, in this here century 
 For real!
