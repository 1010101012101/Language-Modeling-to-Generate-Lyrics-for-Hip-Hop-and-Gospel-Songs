I have within me, this knowledge 
 The darkness within 
 That none should ever touch 
 And in the machinations of cosmos 
 I appeared, centuries before my time 
 ...Wisdom is lost here... 
 The ferocity of my rapture, has no relent 
 'Gainst the ineffable nightmares 
 Seizing my body to wake 
 Through the languid hours of day 
 Excised in the blood of my pain 
 The sombrous call of the silence 
 Haunts me... allures me... 
 Yet the salacious beckoning of the flesh remains 
 I will move not for death or suffering 
 Dissident, I stand proud amidst felony 
 This virulence seethes in my quintessence 
 A reflection of past 
 From the time of conception 
 Life... the allusion of existence 
 (The antipathy of logic...) 
 It beholds everything 
 And yet it is nothing 
 Life is... the beginning of death 
 Death's omnipotent grasp 
 Scourge's down amidst the skies 
 Plucking those led to be slaughtered 
 Culling their futilitarian existence 
 Death is nothing, but the answer to life 
 Death is life's answer
