Incessent drone of misery 
 Pyrrhonism grows into my veins 
 Like a parasite feeding upon my gain 
 In the wake of elucidation 
 Thoughts are manifested amidst the senses 
 Deep despair distorts these bloodstained eyes 
 Scarred with the vision of death 
 My mind implodes with exacerbation 
 Rage destroying the self 
 As madness takes my hand 
 Thoughts I cannot own 
 Escape from this turmoil 
 Reflections dance in the mirror 
 Like the demons raging through my mind 
 They possess me 
 Through twisted words, mangled and unseen 
 The light, dark, lashing me 
 I fall beneath the earth 
 Staring throughout space 
 As though searching for a soul 
 That has become lost to me 
 Death stalked for such time 
 That it came unseen 
 Didn't even see my soul die 
 Only felt the pain of when it had gone 
 I cast the mould of dreams 
 And fall into their prophetic maze 
 The hidden, revealed through rhetoric persuasion 
 It passes 
 As a whisper in the night 
 And to live waiting to meet it's deathly face yet again 
 There is no truth 
 The circle of time unravels 
 The mysteries we have created 
 We may borrow time 
 Only until death takes us 
 Words have no meaning 
 I am so cold 
 So cold
