I ponder eternity 
 Longing for the keys of time 
 To wrap me in their infinite knowledge 
 The incongruous symphony crashes through the waves 
 Of my thoughts 
 I am not of flesh... 
 When waves of sublime thought, coarse through my veins 
 Symbolic release of sorrow 
 Makes way for the impending vision 
 I am where space nor time could not be 
 Suddenly... disembodied... 
 Lost in the vortex of insanity 
 (I am) quickened by the poison 
 Yet deadened by the pain 
 Unable to breathe, I release the beast from within 
 No conscious thought 
 Cimmerian voyage transcends 
 Searing through endless planes 
 Exalted streams of consciousness 
 Plant mine will into the seeds of time 
 "Senses, elucidated 
 (Visions of thought cast before me) 
 Logic dictates no longer 
 To the workings of time" 
 Such nonsensical truths 
 Caress my sumptuous blood 
 Envelop me in this forbidden arcanum 
 I, the seer of my destiny 
 The harbinger of despair 
 Slumber into the enticement of sorrows 
 Through the quiescent halls of existence 
 The freedom of chaos... 
 The secret of the secret... 
 The truth of the truth...
