On the radio you speak 
 To millions that you claim to teach 
 Minions never out of reach 
 Propaganda brings belief 
 It's a lie 
 It's a lie 
 Speak the speak the quips you quote 
 You never write the speech you note 
 If they can view then they can vote 
 False sincerity that you emote 
 Nobody knows exactly what the future holds 
 Claim to have a second sight until the day unfolds 
 When will they see that the path I choose is up to me 
 The scars that they leave are deep 
 Make decisions through the night 
 Proven wrong but claim they're right 
 Drag the world into their fight 
 Your leader leads you into this plight
