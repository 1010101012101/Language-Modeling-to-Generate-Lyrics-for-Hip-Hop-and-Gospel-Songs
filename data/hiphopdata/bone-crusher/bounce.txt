You are my soldiers 
 Just bounce 
 When we bounce, you bounce 
 Lets make the club bounce 
 To the east what you doin'? 
 We bouncin', we bouncin' 
 To the west what you doin'? 
 We bouncin', we bouncin' 
 To the north what you doin'? 
 We bouncin', we bouncin' 
 To the south what you doin'? 
 We bouncin', we bouncin' 
 I, come to deliver, a message so clear 
 Do or die, the consequences, ain't nothing to fear 
 Who am I? 
 I be the giver, I ride with the wind 
 I'm beginning to redeliver, One deeper within 
 If you believe, won't wait for long 
 Better stop, look and listen and pay attention to what's goin' on 
 Analyze and disguise before the bass is low 
 Recognize, the truth lies within this danger zone 
 When I say danger, my body emits 
 Chemicals straight to the brain so that I'm fully equipped 
 I contain my mental anger 
 By letting it rip 
 From the chords in my pores 
 To the rhymes I commit 
 To the east what you doin'? 
 We bouncin', we bouncin' 
 To the west what you doin'? 
 We bouncin', we bouncin' 
 To the north what you doin'? 
 We bouncin', we bouncin' 
 To the south what you doin'? 
 We bouncin', we bouncin' 
 A military mind 
 I pull up to the curb 
 Right to the valet 
 Then I walk right in the entrance 
 And the crowd is yelling "hey" 
 I got paid, so lets play, send the bartender my way 
 They say that money talks and I sure got a lot to say 
 Ask about me in the south 
 Mother nature say she proud 
 I been known to make it rain 
 Ben and Franklin erase the droubt 
 We don't smack outside the club 
 I'm the hustle poster child 
 I Walk up to bank tellers 
 Then I pull my pistols out 
 Got so much jewelry security gon' have to search me 
 Most people friendly but the ones who ain't can never hurt me 
 A semi on the side, I'ma call it Eddie Murphy 
 Bet my pockets speak another language like: Iebadirtay 
 She thought it was a salad 
 She noticed all the karots 
 So vegetarian, all this green and all this cabbage 
 And I'm feelin' like I'm the baddest 
 Get it if you wanna grab it 
 No need for words 'cause 'hustle' to me is automatic 
 To the east what you doin'? 
 We bouncin', we bouncin' 
 To the west what you doin'? 
 We bouncin', we bouncin' 
 To the north what you doin'? 
 We bouncin', we bouncin' 
 To the south what you doin'? 
 We bouncin', we bouncin' 
 I hear 'em talking money but I ain't seen nothin' 
 I'll be bumpin at the gum shoutin: 'He ain't sayin' nothin' 
 First of all: I'm a gangster, I'm gon take yours 
 Big Willie in the game, I'm a pimp and you're my whore 
 I declare, I swear, I ain't seen nothin' hot 
 They keep talkin' 'bout the cash, that's all these n**gas got 
 I dun told y'all n**gas: 'I'm back once again' 
 Here to take all these bitches 
 I ain't lookin' for no friends 
 I'm a grinder, hustler, made it, done it 
 I'm the one that ain't scared 
 Y'all n**gas don't want it 
 Got a personal vendetta against all these mo-foes 
 Mentality of a killa on all these weak ho's 
 To the east what you doin'? 
 We bouncin', we bouncin' 
 To the west what you doin'? 
 We bouncin', we bouncin' 
 To the north what you doin'? 
 We bouncin', we bouncin' 
 To the south what you doin'? 
 We bouncin', we bouncin'
