 All these rappers rapping bout how the got that work 
 How the fuck you niggaz working when you always at work 
 Boy would y'all, I ball, like them cats at rucker 
 The streets is how I eat 'em a living legend muah fucka 
 From dirty dirty dizzy, ask about g-rizzie 
 Twerkin', workin, never perpin, weighing up on the skizzy 
 Young nigga, I got workers bringin' down my bags 
 It ain't hard to pop a nigga and break down that mag 
 Toss it, bosses, I got box full of guns 
 Got a ox-cadet, like that nigga tommy gunz 
 Tons whatever, least the tons lil chedda 
 Game I'm ahead of, hollows when you can find a thousand or betta

 They was like boooooooooy, would you do a remix

 My phone won't stop ringing, jewels won't stop gleaming 
 Clock g's, park trees out of drop v's (bitch) 
 Betta boss up and get this money 
 The clique stopped in chinchillas, but still got old school minks 
 And when the spot get hot, we set up shop in another hood 
 Come up with the lowest ticket, so it's all good 
 Weather, east or west got the streetlord loving 
 Put a slug, in a thug, if he do too much mugging 
 I'm rich, I got that thang on me when we clubbing 
 Plus I'm fifty deep, get yo ass stomped with a hundred feet 
 Dirty glove, stl, we run the streets, (bitch) 
 Boss up and get this money 
 (Verse 3: h-gee) 
 I fucks with icewood, I put the mix in this tapes 
 Then it's back to the kitchen gotta mix me a cake 
 Catch me off in hotlanta, with the michigan flakes 
 Pushing keys like pianos, on a mission for pay 
 We get dough round here, all my niggaz is straight 
 O just pulled up in that quarter to eight 
 U niggaz still counting bags, we hit the border for weight 
 Plus I heard y'alls going half on a quarter of cake 
 Boy would they... please boss up 
 These niggaz is probably mad, they need to catch up
