(Talking) 
 Uh, yeah heard these niggaz wanted to holla at me (here I go) 
 I ain't dead ... I'm right here in ya face baby boy (here I go) 
 I ain't never scared (I ain't never dead) 
 I ain't hiding ...I'm riding 
 The doctor say I neva walk again 
 That's fucked up that them niggaz that shot me up 
 They man's and never talk again, speak again, breath again 
 Seven times with a 'k, and still here to see another day 
 Damn you lucky blade (naw dog I ain't done yet) 
 Got killers on they block chillin' every night the sunset 
 Blood sweat and tears, years of hard hustlin 
 Tusslin, I'm just tryna sit up here wit russell 'nem 
 Jigga 'nem a couple hundred mill in my bank account (plus) 
 Keep a couple o's of perp in my dank account 
 U call yourselves killers (what?) y'all niggaz is hoes 
 Bums, act like y'all want it nigga come get some 
 Don't hide, ride on see how long you last 
 Got niggaz fresh out of jail that's gone kill you for cash 
 Niggaz wanna ask, for a pass like I'ma give you one 
 I ain't gone stop to the reaper come and visit son 
 I heard the want to ride on me 
 Bitch nigga bring it on, got the chrome on my lap as we speak 
 I heard the want to ride on me 
 Nigga I ain't never scared I'm at the club every night I'm everywhere 
 The whole hood will want you (bitches) like my last CD 
 And just for the record homie I don't blast in these 
 Shouldn't have never let me live seven shots couldn't do it 
 Now niggaz making calls like they wasn't involved 
 Niggaz wanna run and hide till the beef is resolved 
 But fuck that I'm killing all of y'all (ah ha ha) 
 Niggaz kind of got me feeling like fifty and pac 
 But difference is I ain't dead, or running from the feds 
 Every tear my mama shed, another thousand on ya head 
 And show ya face nigga think I'm playing 
 This ain't no rap shit nigga, this revenge wit a pen 
 And if I see you (say hello to my little friend) 
 You claim to be cut-throat, bitch nigga u a custo 
 Fake muah fucka like MC gusto 
 Anybody can be coaching or shooting you lil pussy 
 Dick sucking niggaz, I'ma make you niggaz hate me 
 Every since I got shot every body wanna sign me (fuck that) 
 Police wanna question me, but they can't find me 
 Icy ass necklace, two or three rolex's 
 I'ma make sure the industry don't ever forget us 
 Detroit (yeah) that's the city I claim 
 I'm on stage twenty thousand people screaming my name 
 Damn near died, nine twenty o four 
 Looking at my son's eyes while I'm bleeding on the floor 
 So you see, being icewood ain't that easy 
 Please believe, easy hoes gone see hoes easy 
 And even with that other nigga, I ain't saying no names 
 I was laughing that night yo little boss got flamed 
 I was blowing on the chokers banging sounds in the range 
 Niggaz always hating when you worth a lil change 
 And I ain't a angel I know my life need change 
 That's why every night I fall to my knees and prayed to his name
