(Feat. K-Doe) 
 (Talking) 
 Ah, You now rockin' with the best (uh huh) 
 Ice Ice Ice (Icewood) let me clear my throat, Icewood! 
 (Verse 1: Blade Icewood) 
 I got the game on lock y'all know my name 
 Since the last time I dropped a whole lot done changed 
 I'm fresh up out the gutter man, the doors go up now 
 The hoes use to hate me, now they love my style 
 In New York they love my country slang 
 I'm from Detroit where niggas get rich off cane 
 Don't be fooled, yeah I rap, but I'll bust your brain 
 Stomp your ass with these Icewood kicks. 
 Now I done, Stuck ya bitch niggas can't tell me shit 
 Louie straight out the cup your bitch all on my dick 
 She can't keep her eyes off my neck and wrist 
 I don't blame her she probably never seen no shit like this 
 You better get her, 'cause I love me a bitch that's thick 
 And I know she would love to get fucked in the six 
 If she a smoker, she probably love this Purple shit 
 Now she in the Trans, turn the sounds up so she can do my dance 
 We got the Game on Lock, Heat stay cocked 
 We got that work and we'll flood your block 
 We keep it crackin' over here baby, yeah 
 We keep it crackin' over here baby 
 (Verse 2: K-Doe) 
 It ain't hard to tell, shit I know you know by now 
 Dirty Glove run the town, rap, bricks, or pounds 
 Keep the strap real close, who say I'm doing the most 
 Caught two heater cases still ride with the toast 
 But hey, I'm living in the Dirty D 
 And they really wanna get you when they nineteen a key, see 
 You ain't even on my level 
 When my voice hit the track niggas turning up the treble 
 Son of a rebel, scoop work with a shovel 
 Try to tell 'em, don't get slick you fuckin' with the devil 
 Yeah, and my mind ain't right, sometimes when I get bored 
 I just hop on a flight, get out of sight to a place where the bricks are white 
 And you don't gotta count it 'cause the cheese be right 
 If you knew what I knew 
 You probably get your shit together go and switch up your crew, yeah 
 (Verse 3: Blade Icewood) 
 I let my mag talk for me, my jag talk for me 
 My cash talk for me, yo, what up homie 
 Talkin' that tough shit you really don't know me 
 These hating ass rap niggas so damn phony 
 I'm getting blowed in that seventy-two old 
 On spinning rims, word on the street I'm cold with the flow 
 Gangsta, gangsta, I'll show you how to do it 
 Rims, twenty two inch, gems, looking blueish 
 I know I sound arrogant, but dogg I'm so rich 
 Original Chedda Boys, dogg and we run shit 
 Selling out the hood like Master P 
 Went to Gary, cashed out on that three tone masterpiece 
 With yellow diamonds, fine diamonds 
 Square diamonds, round diamonds, been down for a while but I'm still shining 
 Tried to cop that Bentley Coupe with the suede lining 
 But it's a 6-0-8, same color rims out the gate
