Ah ah I don't know why why 
 It seems like every other night you pick a fight fight 
 And I know I do the same 
 Be calling you out your name 
 This is not what lovers are supposed to do do 
 You tell me to go I start walking out 
 We both know what we're all about 
 We first fight and scream but it's all because of love 
 But we ain't never giving up 
 Everytime I try to leave something tells me turn around 
 Cause how could I ever leave the only one that holds me down 
 'Cause I know we can work it out work it out 
 Talk it out talk it out 
 Stick it out stick it out ooh 
 Everytime I try to leave I know we can figure it out 
 That's why I always turn around 
 Before you say say 
 Something you know you'll take back later on today 
 Sometimes you drive me crazy but I love you babe 
 All I ask is that you'll always appreciate me 
 You tell me to go I start walking out 
 We both know what we're all about 
 We first fight and scream but it's all because of love 
 But we ain't never giving up 
 Everytime I try to leave something tells me turn around 
 Cause how could I ever leave the only one that holds me down 
 'Cause I know we can work it out work it out 
 Talk it out talk it out 
 Stick it out stick it out ooh 
 Everytime I try to leave I know we can figure it out 
 That's why I always turn around 
 Ain't nobody that could love me 
 Like you love me 
 That's why I always turn around 
 For you you y-you you you... 
 Ain't nobody that could love me 
 Like you love me 
 That's why I always turn around 
 For you you y-you you you... 
 Everytime I try to leave something tells me turn around 
 Cause how could I ever leave the only one that holds me down 
 'Cause I know we can work it out work it out 
 Talk it out talk it out 
 Stick it out stick it out ooh 
 Everytime I try to leave I know we can figure it out 
 That's why I always turn around
