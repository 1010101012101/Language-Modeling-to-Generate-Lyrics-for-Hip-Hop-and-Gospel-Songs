Ooh ooh oh oh ooh 2x 
 Oh oh 
 You've been hurt before 
 Girl I know you 
 Your heart's been through the storm and more 
 I can tell you barely survived 
 But girl my love won't be the same 
 I'm not trying to run no game 
 Just want your tears to dry 
 Girl why do I have to pay for your past 
 I don't 
 Do you want to come at last
