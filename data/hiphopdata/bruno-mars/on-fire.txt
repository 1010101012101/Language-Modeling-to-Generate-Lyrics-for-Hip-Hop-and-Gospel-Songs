Oh (oh) Oh (oh) Oh 
 Oh (oh) Oh (oh oh) 
 Keep crawling up touchin' ya', kissin' ya', lovin' ya' 
 The ice is melting down your back 
 Cause there's a flame between us 
 Girl with every single touch 
 It's like your body strikes a match 
 I'mma need to 
 Stop (stop) 
 Drop (drop) 
 And roll (roll) 
 Cause baby girl your heat's out of control 
 Feels like I'm on fire (fire) (ey ey ey) 
 My body's a 100 degrees 
 Every time you standing next to me 
 Feels like I'm on fire (fire) (ey ey ey) 
 Girl you make me so hot

 Oh you got me burning up (oh-oh) burning up

 So turn it up (oh-oh) turn it up (oh-oh) some more 
 Feels like I'm on fire (fire) (ey ey ey) 
 My temperature is higher 
 I'm sweating with desire 
 Feels like I'm on fire 
 The smoke detector's going off 
 The neighbour's gonna make the call 
 The fire trucks are on their way (oh their way, oh!) 
 Now we're both turning red 
 We've been up and down the bed 
 We don't care so we say 
 I'mma need to 
 Stop (stop) 
 Drop (drop) 
 And roll (roll) 
 Cause baby girl your heat's (your heat's) 
 Out of (out of) control (control)
