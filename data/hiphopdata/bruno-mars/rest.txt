Everyday I wake up next to an angel 
 More beautiful than words can say 
 They said it wouldn't work but what did they know? 
 Cause years have passed and were stil here today 
 Never ...in my dreams did I think 
 That is woluld happen to me 
 As I stand here before my woman ... 
 I can't fight back the tears in my eyes 
 Oh how could I be so lucky 
 I'm must have done something right 
 And I promise to love her for the rest of my life. 
 Seems like yesterday when she first said hello 
 Funny how time flys when you're in love 
 It took us a life time to find eachother 
 It was worth the wait caus I fuinally found the one 
 Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen 
 To me 
 As I stand here before my woman 
 I can't fight back the tears in my eyes. 
 Oh how could I be so lucky 
 I must have done something right. 
 And I promise to love her for the rest of my life.
