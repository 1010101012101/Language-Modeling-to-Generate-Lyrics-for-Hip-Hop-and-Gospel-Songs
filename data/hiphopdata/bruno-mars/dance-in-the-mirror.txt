She wakes up in the morning... morning 
 Jumps in the shower... shower 
 Ooh ooh 
 Then rubs on her lotion... lotion 
 While she's wrapped in her towel... towel 
 Ooh ooh 
 And no music on 
 Watch her dance to perfection... perfection 
 Ooh ooh 
 I swear the bathrooms a club 
 The way she's showing love to her reflection... reflection 
 Ooh ooh 
 Every morning I watch her from behind 
 But she don't know 
 I pretend that I'm asleep 
 But I don't miss a show 
 My favourite part of the day 
 Is when she dance in the mirror 
 Dance in the mirror 
 There's nothing more I can say 
 Just watch her dance in the mirror... dance 
 Ooh she's so cute... cute... cute 
 Dancing in the nude... nude... nude oh 
 My favourite part of the day 
 Is when she dance in the mirror 
 Dance in the mirror 
 It's late in the evening... evening 
 We got dinner reservations... reservations 
 Ooh ooh 
 She's taking her time 
 But I don't mind waiting 
 No No 
 I don't get impatient 
 'Cause when she gets naked 
 Oh the temptation... Oh the temptation 
 You make me wanna cancel all of our plans 
 Keep you right where you stand 
 Just wanna see you dance oh 
 Every morning I watch her from behind 
 But she don't know 
 I pretend that I'm asleep 
 But I don't miss a show 
 My favourite part of the day 
 Is when she dance in the mirror 
 Dance in the mirror 
 There's nothing more I can say 
 Just watch her dance in the mirror... dance 
 Ooh she's so cute... cute... cute 
 Dancing in the nude... nude... nude oh 
 My favourite part of the day 
 Is when she dance in the mirror 
 Dance in the mirror 
 Oh 
 She's singing to herself like Da-da-da-da-da-da 
 Oh 
 She's singing to herself like Da-da-da-da-da-da 
 My favourite part of the day 
 Is when she dance in the mirror 
 Dance in the mirror 
 There's nothing more I can say 
 Just watch her dance in the mirror... dance 
 Ooh she's so cute... cute... cute 
 Dancing in the nude... nude... nude oh 
 My favourite part of the day 
 Is when she dance in the mirror 
 Dance in the mirror
