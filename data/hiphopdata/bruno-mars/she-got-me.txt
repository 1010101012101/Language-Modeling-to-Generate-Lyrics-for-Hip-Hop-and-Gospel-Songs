I gotta find my way out of this hell, you got me into, 
 My baby's sleepin' in anothers bed, 
 It's like I'm dreamin' that walls are closing in on me, 
 I just wanna know you care. 
 I wanna find out why, you didn't choose to stay, baby, 
 You got me going crazy 
 Ooh... my baby she got me oh no... she left me a prisoner inside my words, ooh... my baby she got me oh no... she locked me in prison like a criminal 
 Everyday's the same, your word, lied away, when all you go and done isn't me, I can see you now, your long brown hair and your white wedding gown, baby I'm missing you... 
 I wanna find out why, you didn't choose to stay oh..., oh ya..., 
 Ooh... my baby she got me oh no... she left me a prisoner inside my words, ooh... my baby she got me oh no... she locked me in prison like a criminal 
 I can't stop this, all this daydreaming, I gotta do my time... I ooh... I can't get out, I don't wanna feel this way, save me from this misery... 
 I wanna find out why, you didn't choose to stay, baby..., you got me going crazy... 
 Ooh... my baby she got me oh no... she left me a prisoner inside my words, ooh... my baby she got me oh no... she locked me in prison like a criminal 
 I promise to love ya, hold ya, even when time got hard and I can still see us being forever, but now we're falling apart... 
 I wanna find out why, you didn't choose to stay, baby... you got me, ooh... my baby she got me oh no... she left me a prisoner inside my words, ooh... my baby she got me oh no... she locked me in prison like a criminal
