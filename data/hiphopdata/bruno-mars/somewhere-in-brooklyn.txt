She was covered in leather and gold 
 Twenty-one years old 
 I lost her in the cold, 
 It's unfair, she's out there... 
 Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn 
 She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn 
 Little Miss Perfect sitting at the train stop, 
 Red Nike high-tops, listening to hip-hop 
 While we were waiting, started conversating 
 Before I got her name, along came a train (oh) 
 Oh! 
 Next stop Brooklyn, 
 Oh! 
 Oh! 
 Now I'm lookin'... 
 She was covered in leather and gold 
 Twenty one years old 
 I lost her in the cold, 
 It's unfair, she's out there... 
 Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn 
 She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn 
 (Ciki-ciki) 
 On the street, kickin' rocks, 
 Circlin' the same block 
 Greenpoint to Flatbush, 
 Checking every corner shop, 
 Tappin' people's shoulders, askin' if they know her 
 Everyday's the same, it's back to the train 
 Oh! 
 Oh! 
 Next stop Brooklyn, 
 Oh! 
 Oh! 
 I'm still lookin' 
 She was covered in leather and gold, 
 Twenty-one years old 
 I lost her in the cold, 
 It's unfair, she's out there... 
 Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn, 
 She's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, I wonder will we ever meet again, 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Oh, I wonder will we ever meet again 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Yeah, I wonder, if we'll ever meet again 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 I hope we do, 
 Somewhere in Brooklyn
