Oh oh oh oh oh 
 When I was just a little boy 
 Barely strong enough to stand 
 I can always count on him oh 
 He taught me everything I know 
 And till this day it shows 
 He was more than just a friend 
 There was so many times I would doubt myself 
 But his words were always there to help 
 I wouldn't be 
 Where I am 
 If my father didn't tell me 
 To never say I can't 
 He'd carry me 
 And never let me fall 
 Oh and the only thing he asked 
 Right before he passed 
 Was to never say you can't 
 Oh never say you can't 
 Oh 
 So when lifes rain begins to fall 
 And you're out there on your own 
 And you can't see a thing 
 Oh no no 
 Just find that voice that understands 
 For me it was my old man 
 Taught me to say the words I can 
 Oh 
 There was so many times I would doubt myself 
 But his words were always there to help 
 I wouldn't be where I am 
 If my father didn't tell me to never say I can't 
 He'd carry me 
 And never let me fall 
 Oh and they only thing he asked 
 Right before he passed 
 Was to never say you can't 
 Everything you taught me will stay with me forever 
 No I won't forget a thing 
 Oh because of my dad I now know myself better 
 Oh I hope I can do for him what he did for me 
 I wouldn't be where I am 
 If my father didn't tell me 
 To never say I can't 
 Oh he'd carry 
 And never let me fall 
 Oh and they only thing he asked 
 Right before he passed 
 Was to never say you can't 
 Oh never say you can't (x2)
