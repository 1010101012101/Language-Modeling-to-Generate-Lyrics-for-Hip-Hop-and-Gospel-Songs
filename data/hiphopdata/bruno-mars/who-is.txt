Oh, I was perfect 
 For the circus 
 If she dared me, I do it 
 Love makes you stupid 
 I gave it up, But I guess it was not enough 
 'Cause she never seemed satisfied 
 (Ooh) 
 I Know I'm not perfect 
 But at the end of the day 
 Who is? 
 (Ooh) 
 She wanted someone that's perfect 
 Well Okay 
 But can you tell me Who is? 
 (Ooh x2) 
 She set the bar 
 Just above the stars 
 A rocket could'nt reach it 
 But I still kept on reaching 
 She watched me try 
 At least a thousand times 
 If she loved me, She'd stop me But no 
 (Ooh) 
 I Know I'm not perfect 
 But at the end of the day 
 Who is? 
 (Ooh) 
 She wanted someone that's perfect 
 Well Okay 
 But can you tell me Who is? 
 I saw something worth my future 
 So wrong So wrong 
 In my mind I was all it took 
 But I guess I wasn't wrong 
 (Ooh) 
 I Know I'm not perfect 
 But at the end of the day 
 Who is? 
 (Ooh) 
 She wanted someone that's perfect 
 Well Okay 
 But can you tell me Who is? 
 (Ooh x2)
