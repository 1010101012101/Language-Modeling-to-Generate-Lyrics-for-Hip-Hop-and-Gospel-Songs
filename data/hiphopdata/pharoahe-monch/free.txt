I'm x10 
 I'm Free! 
 Free! 
 Free! 
 You can take my ways, shackle and chain me 
 Back straight, standin' tall, child of God I'm (Free!) 
 Spit in my face, hold me down 
 I keep my feet firm to the ground 'cause I'm (Free!) 
 Ya A&R's the house nigga, the label is the plantation 
 Now switch that advance for your emancipation 
 You seeds in the field, like picked cotton for real 
 I pop glocks like Beat street with an option to kill 
 They take the strongest of slaves to compete in a track meet 
 For the king of the city, sing songs of back streets 
 Choruses of cocaine tales and black heat 
 Only to trade niggas like professional athletes 
 They'll take that merchandising 
 Snatch that publishing 
 Pack that black ass, ship you to London 
 Buy a way to France, Germany, Dublin 
 A real rogue from underground like Harriet Tubman 
 While y'all stay struggling, we smuggle MCs through the streets 
 They'll be bubblin' on mixed CDs, hustlin' 
 Klan seen me on the block and said, "Freeze!" 
 I said, "Fuck you! I'm a man, I'm Free!" 
 Ok... 
 I give birth to verses in churches with no confession 
 So please pardon my postpartum depression 
 A-list MCs can spit it in C-sections 
 For immature minds to get it with each lesson 
 Three Fifth's of a man ask nigga with no plans, 
 "How you discussin' publishing figures without a ?Man.?" 
 They got digital codes on the music for them to scan 
 So even when you sample a snare you payin' the clan 
 Now Google Pharoahe Monch, search "trescadecaphobia" (triskaidekaphobia") 
 I'll explain while these 'City Banks' 'watch over ya/Wachovia' 
 I peeped the future in my sleep 
 To be honest man, we never had a 'Mutual' relationship with 'Washington' (Why?) 
 'Cause I believe they put the virus in the latex 
 Condoms that they sell us, call it "Safe Sex" 
 When I spit, they not only call it just a glitch in the Matrix 
 But an errorless, terror threat that they ain't even face yet
