Chorus [phonte]: 
 Open the door let me in 
 Teach us all, preach your sins, 
 Turn the cheek, let it slide 
 Give me five on the black hand slide 
 [Styles p]: 
 Give me five on the black hand side 
 Tell you what I see through the black man's eyes 
 Look like shit in a Cadillac a black man rise 
 But every different day a different black man dies 
 Shorty momma tripping' off a crack man high 
 Now he watching TV, loving the bad guy 
 (You know) piss poor with a welfare check 
 You know he African, 'cause he ain't getting healthier yet 
 Now he put down his knapsack, got a crack pack 
 You don't know if it's there if your vision ain't abstract 
 We in the projects, a lot of us is lab rats 
 Voted for Obama, hoping he wouldn't have that 
 Now I can tell you that I felt 
 Hell, I still remember how a cell smell 
 Still remember how the pigs at 
 Family crying up on the VI, I couldn't dig that 
 Open the door, and teach us all 
 Pass the blunt around hope that it reach us all 
 Now give me five on the black hand side 
 Ghost of Pharoahe Monch watch the black man rise 
 Chorus [phonte] 
 [Pharoahe monch]: 
 Pharaohs and Navajo chiefs, the way you making it rain 
 But never for a stripper with emotional pain 
 You wouldn't despite system nourishment for the brain 
 Cause rain, seed, plus soil equals fruits and grains 
 My hood talking nigga keep it simple and plain 
 To let me explain the game break it down a couple of levels like Tetris 
 This youngest killer gone blood for a necklace 
 Leave slumped over the wheel of you're Lexus 
 Smoke kush, wake up, and eat breakfast 
 What the fuck you expect? 
 A generation overly obsessed with mobsters 
 Our revolutionaries want Grammys and Oscars 
 Imposters, fake auras and weak shakras 
 Making a mockery of the music to be pop stars 
 And they say I'm insane 
 'Cause I see the remains of the whips and the chains 
 In my hood were it ain't all good, 
 Peep the pain of a single mother she struggling 
 Young child slang, give me five on the black hand side 
 Lets maintain like the soul train 
 And keep it moving together, I'm saying 
 Chorus [phonte]
