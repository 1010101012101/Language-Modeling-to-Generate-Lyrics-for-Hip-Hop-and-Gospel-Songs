Chorus: Pharoahe Monch and Shabaam Sahdeeq (repeat 2X) 
 Weight of the world on your shoulders gotta hold it up 
 When the pen's burnin the paper never fold it up 
 When the plan is set in motion never slow it up 
 We seize the planet like war then we blow it up 
 (Pharoahe Monch) 
 Cleverly beginnin 'em with synonyms when I went in with homynyms 
 Extended 'em out, defendin 'em with linear raps when enbalmin em 
 Bendin 'em back, blendin 'em with miraculous type 
 Fuck is up? Y'all niggaz do like Dracula's bite 
 Uh, don't even bother gotta lotta cats who swallow 
 For dollar raps scholar holla back like a Rawk' wilder 
 Me get ya hit ya split ya open sit you down 
 Get you in the ring, sling slang boxing rounds withcha 
 Snap your bone gristle, Crystal motel 
 Queens missile pistol-whip you army issue shouldn't fuck witchu 
 Or get niggaz like Yusef, you're useless 
 Attack back, smack your whole team toothless 
 Now welcome to the New York Knicks 
 Where Averex are the jerseys and the boots are the kicks 
 Y'all on the dick the way we pose for the flicks 
 Queens style, Redhook now all in the mix 
 (Shabaam Sahdeeq) 
 P, pass the baton, we mashin whatever crew want Sahdeeq 
 Black on tracks like Dutch flashbacks 
 Settle the score, make y'all know for sure 
 That what we, bring to the table your mental'll digest 
 Put away your forks, can't eat these MC's 
 Just as, hungry as you, hungry as you 
 Snatch it our your hand before you bite or chew, we invitin you 
 To spar, with the likes of this two, got you spillin your brew 
 Intercept your soundwave, bitch! 
 Hijack your frequency quick, and bang our shit 
 Motivated to make it but foes try to block flows 
 Knock those, crush 'em like a bag of nachoes 
 Keep 'em on they toes, word up, like ballet 
 You sweet sap suckers get served like cafes 
 You candy cats melt in my pockets like Milky Ways 
 Southside, BK hurtin' niggaz for days 
 [SS] Blow it up with incredible landmine rhymes 
 [PM] Federal crime for sure, THIRD WORLD WAR 
 [SS] Weight on my back like Atlas, our tactics 
 To hem 'em like denim and pin they back to the canvas 
 [PM] Yo, who want this, who want nu-ttin but conflict 
 Blow up they barracks with a C-4 brick 
 [SS] WE MOVE SWIFT, so you better react quick AND 
 Watch your nugget 'fore we launch these hits
