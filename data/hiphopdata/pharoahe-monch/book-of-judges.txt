America the ugly raped my mother 
 Deceived my sister separated my brother 
 Murdered my children hung my father 
 Now they want me to rock the vote the fucks why bother? 
 Seen them commercials for the army of whatever 
 Picture me giving a damn, I said never! 
 My minds too short my brain's too clever 
 My spine is too strong every line pulls your lever 
 Limitless rhymes for the indigenous the remedy 
 PLAT! Getting' my money like the Kennedy's 
 Flip it! Put em' in stocks collect anemities 
 Rock, roll behold my epiphanies and 
 Read em' and weep, heat I beat em' to sleep 
 Mislead em' until we even-steven defeat em' with freedom of speech 
 And we let them know that I'm the motherfuckin' fire-starter 
 Piss on the constitution and burn the Magna Carta 
 All I know is what I feel 
 Deceive my eyes and distort what's real 
 Only truth will set you free 
 I rather die on my feet than delivery my knees 
 We dying over black gold they harvesting in the sand 
 Presidents living marvelous, they starving in Sudan 
 It's obvious we walk a blind path to oblivion 
 The book of judges read the scriptures unlike Gideon 
 Light my fire, start my engine 
 When Pharaohe becomes Moses its medicine for who listens 
 A veteran with the might bringing with prophecy to fruition 
 Motivation verses on an adverse condition 
 Caught on the mainframe I see the maze man 
 They watch you from the street light you and your main man 
 The bar code around your neck same as your name brand 
 You're lost in strange land no thoughts of a game plan 
 All I know is what I feel 
 Deceive my eyes and distort what's real 
 Only truth will set you free 
 I rather die on my feet than delivery my knees 
 Piss on the constitution, then burn the Magna Carta 
 Piss on the constitution, then burn the Magna Carta 
 Piss on the constitution, then burn the Magna Carta 
 Piss on the constitution, then burn the Magna Carta 
 Piss on the constitution, then burn the Magna Carta 
 Piss on the constitution, then burn the Magna Carta 
 Piss on the constitution, then burn the Magna Carta 
 Piss on the constitution, then burn the Magna Carta (fade out)
