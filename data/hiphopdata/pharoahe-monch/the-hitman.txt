OK 
 Yeah 
 Ugh 
 Call me the hitman 
 It's kind of hard ain't it? 
 With the most feared to becoming the game 
 We became it 
 So I painted a masterpiece of an industry tainted 
 It's not a lithograph so it's graphic, frame it 
 The hitman 
 Say it again 
 The hitman 
 The hitman 
 Say it again 
 Say it 
 Some people say I'm extreme broadcast to beam 
 Live through a meme 
 Screaming as Jimmmy Ivine 
 Is Corrupt as Don King 
 Boxed into the ghetto 
 To be champion of bling 
 Industry's the arena the internet is the ring 
 You trained artists from queens 
 To sling music to fiends? 
 Then Def Jam supreme team the same thing 
 Except more critical now 
 It's digital Cocaine 
 The goal to control every individual brain 
 Like Cadillacs for contracts in the sixties 
 Now it's rap for you 60 
 For contract 3-60 
 The trick? 
 Switch to degrees with the three 6's 
 Hardest to left of zero 
 You see who receives the riches 
 Which is the reason why they is only a few moguls 
 Globally the pioneer's are left in a chokehold 
 Enough to make an individual go postal 
 Watching these old folks get fucked for they vocals 
 Say it again 
 The hitman (repeat) 
 If you are not performing felatio for radio rotation 
 What's the ratio for radio play at your station? 
 If you are not paying to play your record is dead 
 Puts a whole new spin on Radio head 
 They gotta 1000 plays a week 
 We selling the same units 
 They put their best rep up 
 The couldn't stand next to it 
 People wanna relate they wanna connect to it 
 Here's a lyrical check 
 Is this enough for you to flex to it 
 Huh? 
 Or do you need more clues 
 Should I be more black 
 Would that change your view? 
 Should I dye my hair blonde should my eyes be blue 
 Just a couple of questions I mustered up for you 
 But these 11 and a half shoes you can't fill those 
 I make headlines like corduroy pillows 
 And probably get banned from television and marketing 
 Targeting music industry politic's provocative 
 It's kinda hard 
 Let's release sex tapes so we can become stars 
 Nude photographs of titties and asses 
 Increase our buzz Impress the masses 
 I thought she was supposed to be so passive 
 Now you just another ass in the air with an asterisk 
 Cell phone songs, you will never be a classic 
 You sold your souls 
 They call that remastering? 
 What does it have to be so drastic? 
 Chemical skin peel makes it sell more plastic 
 Follow the program man 
 Stick to the tactics 
 Twelve to 18 you know the demographics 
 These kids want popcorn 
 They want Slap stick 
 Probably the chorus goes tisket tasket 
 But I'm not willing to risk it, master 
 This might take a couple of listens for you to grasp it 
 The HIT--
