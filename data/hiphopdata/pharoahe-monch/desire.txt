Unh! Oh! 
 Oh! Oh! 
 Oh! Oh! 
 Oh! 
 Said it's my desire! Yes it is! yeah 
 Yes it is, yes it is, oh yeah... 
 Comprehend the guidelines 
 My chest out, chinchilla'd or relaxed on the sidelines 
 I'm so famous, understand 
 New York City respect my game like Joe Nameth 
 And I protect my name like yo' anus... in prison 
 Y'all don't hear me 
 Y'all don't listen 
 Y'all just wanna shine 
 Y'all just wanna glisten 
 Floss, knowin' the soul is still missin' 
 Who am I? I'm the poetical pastor 
 Slave to a label but I own my master 
 Still get it poppin' without artist and repertoire 
 Cause Monch is a "Monarch", minus the A & R 
 When my brain excels 
 Your train derails 
 Pop shit, make you feel the 'Clipse'/clips like Pharell 
 You will feel me 
 You will admire 
 My struggle 
 My hustle 
 My soul 
 Desire 
 Said it's my desire 
 Yeah 
 My book's an ovary, the pages I lust to turn 
 My pen is the penis, when I write the ink's the sperm 
 Desire - the fire that ignites the torch that burns 
 This is not rocket science, this is easy to turn 
 My mic's a gavel, when I talk court's ajurned 
 Respect, even if you was 'ashes' you couldn't 'urn' 
 I embody antibiotics, you are infected with germs 
 Rap's fatally ill, please get concerned 
 Players pick turns to play, get burned 
 I telecommentate the game like Chick Hearn 
 This is the moment of truth for my opponent's ?alliance? 
 Vocals alone evoke the emotion of black choirs 
 Fire, you don't wanna get burned like Richard Pryor 
 Move back, who's that there, the livewire 
 You will feel me 
 You will admire 
 My struggle 
 My hustle 
 My soul 
 Desire 
 That's my desire 
 Keep pushin' 
 Keep strivin' 
 My passion 
 My fire
