I was determined as damaged, psychologically 
 But still managed to gain a new perspective on the term 
 "Surround yourself with greatness" 
 Found myself standing in a room full of mirrors 
 But even my reflections disrespect you like a freshman during hazing 
 (What an amazing assessment) 
 The police booked me for Booksmart but who the promoters book now? 
 Raised the bar so high that the bar's afraid to look down 
 Spent nights in a casket, at dawn/Don I'm a King 
 Play pawn to a queen, put her throat in the tabernacle 
 So actually you should build a statue of my likeness in the centre of the city 
 (The women were riddled into rose petals) 
 No justice, no peace, no settle 
 We are renegades, fuck your gold medal 
 The people are the majority 
 You can't survive without us, you need us 
 Attitude, never defeat us 
 Rebels, so please believe it's 
 War on the streets of Egypt 
 My vocals a total eclipse of totalitarianism 
 You seek to mistreat us 
 So this is calculated amalgamation 
 One shit fired inspired by hope to arouse a nation 
 (I), I am the renegade
