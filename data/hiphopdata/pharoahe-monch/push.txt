Pushin', pushin', pushin', pushin' 
 I live my life 
 One day at a time 
 Hold my head 
 So I don't lose my mind 
 Sometimes you might fall down 
 But you get back up 
 Get on your journey 
 Yeah, keep on pushin' 
 Pushin', pushin', pushin' 
 I walked downstairs 
 And my body's light 
 Done pushed my struggles 
 Endured my pride 
 I fear no man 
 I know wrong from right 
 We push until the day we see the light 
 And we keep on pushin' 
 Pushin', pushin', pushin' 
 Your weak-ass compubot power shots mix fly over me 
 My accurate jabs connect like rotary 
 Make you notice me, be like: 
 "Damn, dudes on some totally when he rides the bass line like Gin√≥bili" 
 I'm vocally unmatched, nobly 
 With the flow, slow on the ground 
 But mo' public than notary 
 Push, in this era of G.W. Bush 
 We must load mental ammunition and bust 
 Thus, I'm a hold you down, I got you 
 One more repetition I'm a spot you 
 This is for my blue collar workin', beer guzzlin' 
 Bootleg, DVD sellin', keep hustling 
 Push, if you represent the struggle then push 
 Peep the pieces of the puzzle and push 
 Never let 'em place a muzzle just push 
 Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on 
 (Push, push, push, push)
