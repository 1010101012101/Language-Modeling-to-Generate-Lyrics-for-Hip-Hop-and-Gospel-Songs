Yes, how many gorillas who actually killers really rhyming 
 Artists that actually signed still killing 
 And when it comes to killing the mic 
 They not willing and I'm supposed to be shook 
 That's the shit that kill me 
 Take the bullet for Barack on the balcony then vanish 
 Extinguish the sun when I drew 
 Play pool with the planets 
 We are renegades 
 The movement outlandish 
 My shit straight from the soul, goddamnit 
 It's the one time only 
 Vernacular original miraculous spectacular flow 
 Computer digital 
 I piss upon the pitiful 
 Ridicule the minuscule 
 Pharoahe Monch need to pump that ass like municipal 
 And listen to an enigma 
 The anomaly your momma nominated me phenomenal 
 I dominated without a 6-pack abdominal 
 You could get 19 put through that like Amadou 
 So what I'ma do is separate the false from the truest 
 You've amassed nothing trying to ball like you Mass 
 So phenomenal with mics I don't like myself 
 Sadomasochist MC, I bite myself 
 But not cameo though 
 There's no Grammy to show for the love that people hand me on the street 
 Now overstand 
 Grade school mathematics examining thugs 
 They discuss Bloods, Crips, techs, jamming, and drugs 
 I speak of world peace, war, famine, and flood 
 Watching' Pan's Labyrinth while I'm unravelling bud 
 Gambling on the next rapper to die in the hood 
 If God shall choose that artist to be me 
 Let one verse of a song be a reflection of a pedigree 
 Better than your back catalogue recipe 
 The legacy by which the entire world remembers me 
 Quote, do not edit me; let it be said 
 I'm top 5 all time alive! 
 We know that's misstated and so overused 
 So here's a overview of why I'm 6 feet over you 
 And a million fans think this statement is so overdue 
 And pardon if it sounds a little wheezy 
 Not Wayne, motherfuckers I got asthma; it's not easy 
 Shotgun lyrical; cock back, squeeze me 
 Women case my anatomy; touch me, tease me 
 Please seize the moment in the struggle against Lucifer 
 Renegade 13 the Executioner 
 Spit with a crucifix 
 So that you can expect the rant from Pharoahe Monch like Mucinex 
 Get used to it 
 Get used to wisdom 
 Get used to usage of a backward euphemism
