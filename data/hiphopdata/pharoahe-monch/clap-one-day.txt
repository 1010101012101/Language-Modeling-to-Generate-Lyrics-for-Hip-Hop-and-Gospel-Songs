Clap! clap on, clap off, clap Adam and I do not need applause 
 Rap nicer than Santa with no clause 
 Trapped twice bananas with no chorus 
 Yeah, it's suicide, murder 
 In the hood like catalitic converters on the block like lego on the streets like street like 
 3 little pigs is what I be on these beats like 
 In other words the police, say it, say it like pop the police, fuck them 
 And that's straight from the underground 
 Where little kids got it bad 'cause we're brown 
 Now who am I? P. Monch, do or die nuh 
 South suicide Queens where I get down 
 I peep surveillance in the streets every summer 
 You may not play lotto but you know these numbers 
 The 105th, the 103rd, my people in Queens going 13 if we get the urge to get on some? 
 My brain's a glock clip, My lane's be on some 800 cops shot shit 
 Say when we gonna, say when we gonna get it together? yeah 
 One day, one day, one day, one day, we gonna clap, yeah 
 We went from niggas to porch monkeys, to negros, to blacks, back to niggas again 
 Yet the nigga's is still hungry 
 Abolish the "N" word, the plan so corny 
 While homelands security cams are all on me 
 They watch through the fibre optics 
 And it dawned told me that cops can just run in your spot quick without warning 
 They educate the mass to follow is so boring 
 I sat in the back of the class and sleep snoring 
 And they ask me why I'm vocal and animate 
 'Cause I lost my focus like Governor Pattison 
 In the ghetto, where is impossible to escape and the first obstacle was the tapeworm in my abdomen 
 Spit chuck of fuck that, I toss javelins and 5 thousand dollar bills in the face of James Madison 
 This isn't American post mortem, to focus on your bogus, Novus Ordo Seclorum, clap! 
 No respect, and no manners, it's Mad Max with multiple Max mad banana clips. 
 The black hammer hits the back of a black talent 
 Slew a hollow tips hit the wall of your blue salad 
 And selective theatrics and selected dramatics 
 I'm systematically pissed, clap automatics for me and Abu Jamal 
 Maybe I'm ? peace are fanatics for peace, but ain't got a pacifist 
 (The gospel, I) spit it like Jesus of Nazareth and in frantic we clap 
 At any obstacle, an impossible feat, the fathom is not logical 
 But chronicle the thoughts of the people cause one day we gonna CLAP!
