Immortal Technique: We are renegades. This means W.A.R. 
 16s bust to break unjust laws 
 Overthrow regimes in the name of the cause 
 Renegades, never slaves. this means war. 
 100% uncut raw 
 Fuck limited freedom, we want more 
 The machine is corrupted down to the core 
 ? Muthafucka! 
 This means war 
 Pharoahe: 
 I got a middle finger for mass media mute the news 
 'Cause when the gun draws, receive a million views 
 Which gives me the right to break the rules 
 Fuck the radio if the people can't pick and choose 
 While BET gets screwed by Viacom 
 The new revolutionary is shyaman 
 It's not brush fire rap, its five alarm 
 Motivational music after I am gone 
 My innervisions, mysticism call me mister wisdom 
 They wanna turn the globe into a prison 
 And being sick is better than being dead 
 'Cause when you sick and in bed, you're indebted to meds 
 Cloned chickens walking around without heads 
 The food is contaminated, the water got lead in it 
 Population control, make the babies sick 
 ??? 
 Are you for 86 
 This is a war against consciousness 
 Controlling your soul 
 Sort of a psychological dictatorship 
 And we are on the front lines 
 Guilty as charged if intellect is a crime

 Pharoahe: 
 Al-humdillilah's a spiritual calling 
 My aunt ? we still mourning 
 It's not a documentary about global warming 
 This is lunar explosions of global warning 
 So when the moon leaves you can't tell night from morning 
 Cities submerged underwater post New Orleans 
 It's not your average rap recording 
 This is insane lieutenants taking aim at Mormons 
 While the American dream remains dead and dormant 
 My stimuli's supplied by my endorphins 
 The mind's eye greater than pi and broadband 
 I break on through to the other side without doormen 
 It's not The Doors, man 
 I am equipped with a better memory chip than dolphins 
 With more keys to open more doors than four foremen 
 To executive's rooms where they walking on all fours man 
 Canines standing upright amongst you 
 Hated by swine, spreading the H1N1 flu 
 On some rabies shit 
 Are you for 86? 
 Population control, make the babies sick 
 This is a war against consciousness 
 Controlling your soul 
 Sort of a psychological dictatorship 
 And I am on the front lines 
 Guilty as charged if intellect is a crime
