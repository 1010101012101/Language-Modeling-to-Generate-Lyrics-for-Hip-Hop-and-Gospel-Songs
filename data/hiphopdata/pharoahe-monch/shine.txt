In my heart 
 In my mind 
 I'm gonna win 
 And you'll come 
 You tell me to wait 
 Give me a sign 
 And I'm gonna shine 
 I'm gonna shine (repeats) 
 Look man, do not get my block pissed, we'll blast your brain! 
 Two hundred-thousand dollar whips and chains 
 Crooked cops, crips, crack cocaine, Tupac, Chris, 
 I'm still feeling the pain 
 Seven year-old girl shot and slain 
 What these all mean 
 We're goin' insane? 
 In this struggle, stress, mayhem and panic 
 Where I'm from we do not eat organic 
 (Talk about it) 
 See my mama cannot afford Whole Foods 
 She break fast with a prayer, call it soul food 
 Where I come from 
 (Let it breath) 
 Where I come from 
 No one runs when funds run low 
 In lump sums we choose the dum dum dum bullets, dun dun 
 We livin' humdrum in the slums 
 Where scum conceal stun guns 
 The word's mum for fun, son 
 Conundrums ain't pretty 
 In this cesspool called New York Shitty 
 I call it that 'cause it smells like shit 
 Walk around hunched-back or you might get hit 
 I knew a nigger who sold crack to his moms 
 The same mother fucker sold crack to his kids 
 Lookin' like 300 comin' back from his bid, like 
 "Pharoahe, let's get this money for real" 
 He said "Pharoahe, let's get this money up 
 What the fuck 
 What you need me to holler at Steve Rifkind? 
 Let him escape from New York like Snake Plissken? 
 I told you from the gate that you needed more marketing 
 And these major labels is not listening." 
 Stood in a B-boy stance, teeth glistening 
 From the gold in his mouth, summer breeze was whistling 
 I contemplated my retort, eyes fixed in 
 On a crucifix around his neck 
 I guess he was Christian 
 Just then the police siren it pitched into the sound 
 Track to the hood so I spoke with conviction 
 Spoke as if I was 6'10", thick skin, 
 Put a little bass in my voice like pitch bend 
 'Cause where I come from 
 Where I come from, we all come from 
 Sky, moon, stars, earth and a sun 
 Multiple skin tones, the blood is one 
 The pen is the ammo to my automatic 
 I bring to fruition what I write to get me out of the slums 
 And I'ma shine, shine, shine, shine 
 Shine like the sun, the world is mine 
 Each line is speech designed to transcend time and reach 
 The unborn and transform your mind 
 And I'ma shine 
 Shine 
 New York If you're in the house 
 If you're turnin' it out 
 Without a doubt 
 You know what I'm talking about 
 Just scream and shout 
 Everybody say: shine shine shine 
 Now Detroit with the funky beats 
 Gettin' wild on the street 
 See the mark of the beast 
 Say f*** the police 
 (What up, X?) 
 Shine shine shine 
 Chi-town, with the funky sound 
 Soul by the pound 
 Just get on down 
 What the fuck do you want? 
 Say shine shine shine 
 West coast side with the most 
 Holding your toast 
 Brag and boast 
 Everybody say shine shine shine 
 Dirty dirty (repeats)
