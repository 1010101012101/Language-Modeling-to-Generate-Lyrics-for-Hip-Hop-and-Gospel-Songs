(One) One for the money 
 (Two) Two for the show 
 (Three) Three to get it crackin' in the hood (Let's Go!) 
 My rrrrhymes pop like them 9's they claim they tote 
 But they rrrrap lack luster shine 
 My shit bust like Busta RRRRhymes sniffin' lines of coke 
 (Woo Ha!) That's all she wrote 
 I'm on a quest to qualify for these inquisitive quotes 
 Quirk ass MCs be as Queer as Folk 
 Talkin' about, "Nigga can rap!" - No shit sherlock 
 Y'all MCs can't see me like Matt Murdock 
 I'm the pinnacle rhyme kid 
 Any line of mine is criminal minded 
 I blind them with original rhyme shit 
 Fall in line with the set, cynical crime shit 
 Clinically approved for you to move your behind with, timeless 
 All world girls willin' to stride with Pharoahe, do you need to be reminded? 
 Now stick'em up a set 
 Get'em up a set 
 Put'em up a set 
 (Let's Go!) 
 (Pre-hook) 
 (Yeaaaaa, How we rock) 
 (Show them how we, Ro-o-oll) 
 (Ye-e-ea yeah ey yeah) (Let's GO!) 
 Line it up! 
 Light it up! Fire it up! 
 Wire me up, Let it blow 
 (One) One for the money 
 (Two) Two for the show 
 (Three) Three to get it cracking in the hood 
 (Let's Go!) 
 They research my stem cells, clone ten of me 
 Send one of them back in time just to get rid of me 
 Stop Pharoahe Monch from having verbal epiphanies 
 Now that's new definition to your own worst enemy 
 Ock listen man 
 Stop snitchin' man 
 We use sex to cell 
 Then you to 'Nex-to-tel', then Sprint 
 Everything you represent is E-moral 
 'Singular'...not plural 
 You and your sidekick, get rid of that wack trio 
 I freeze MCs zero degrees below 
 The 'blacker the berry', the sweeter the juice 
 You need to get loose, to the heat I produce 
 From Long Beach to Boston 
 You chick 'Tex-us' like Dallas and Austin 
 I spark tireless illumination 
 Fire 16-bars of wireless communication 
 (Let's Go!) 
 (Pre-hook) 
 (Prehook) x2 
 (Scratches and mixes of Pharoahe Monch lyrics) 
 (Pharoahe's flows blows shows) 
 (The M-O-N-C-H) 
 (M-O-N-C-H) 
 (Y'all know the name) 
 (Let's Go!) 
 (Hallelujah! Pharoahe Monch will do ya) 
 (The M-O-N-C-H) 
 (Y'all know the name) 
 (Let's Go!)
