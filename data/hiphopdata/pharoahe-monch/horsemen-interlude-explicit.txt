Yo, yo, the sheer fuckin' assemblin' of these fo' niggas rekindling war 
 Seek the Horsemen, we walk the planet earth on all four's 
 Cause your empire to fall like the season before winter 
 Don't get beside yourself like clone twins in the placenta 
 Assassinate the mayor through time-travel, the assignment 
 To reduce all molecules and pass through solid confinement 
 The only way you could flow is if I liquidize your rhyme 
 Consequently blowin' by me crystalizin' your mind 
 The government assigned sentinels for Horsemen elimination 
 Claimin' we were mutants of artificial insemination 
 Lost my limbs to bomb shrapnel but through cell regeneration 
 The blood accelerates at twice the speed, peep the vindication indeed 
 Think tank full when you blink, think syncronicity 
 Rob three banks at the same time through multiplicity shine 
 Please, these four niggas combine alone 
 Bringin' a nation of MC's to their knees wit ease 
 Siege a soldier and hold men for ransom 
 Stop procreation, chop they cocks off so they can't come 
 Block off a forty mile radius, bomb your fan base 
 Seeds to abnormally born and scorn wit a man's face 
 Indeed watch the moon bleed, we lead by example 
 Loop my life in time, stretch it in a nine like a sample 
 We rock quadrupeds 
 (Horsemen, enforce men) 
 Chop off your fuckin' head 
 (We the Horsemen) 
 Leave you all dead then we eat your carcass 
 (Enforce men, the Horsemen) 
 I'm a horseman 
 (Enforce men) 
 I'm a horseman 
 (The Horsemen) 
 I'm a horseman 
 (The forcemen) 
 We the Horsemen
