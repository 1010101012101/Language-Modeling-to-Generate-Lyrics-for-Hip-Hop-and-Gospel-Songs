Oh 
 Hear me though 
 They'll bury me with my SP-1200 
 (M.o.p): for sho 
 Fuck the trinity inseminate the earth now, take its virginity 
 In my vicinity rap is like energy pack 
 Sending me back behind enemy line to rap too melodic 
 Melodies never melodramatic but hipmatic like Jell-O fo fellow fanatics 
 I fiend for, who FUCK WITS, inappropriate 
 Fill 'em with so much lead I'll call 
 (M.o.p): berger and associates 
 This rhyme, will remain in the minds of my foes forever in infamy 
 The epitome of lyrical epiphanies 
 Skillfully placed home we carefully plan symphonies 
 Who would be ignorant enough to have the audacity 
 To fuck wit the likes of I and my tenacity? 
 This is, what you, get when, you fuck, 
 With the, likes of, the magnanimous flows 
 Of total assholes and ignoramuses 
 M.O.P. slash Pharoahe Monch cause damages 
 The advantage is we banish artists labels and managers 
 Amateurs found six feet deep, in metal canisters we 
 M.o.p: show no mercy 
 Pharoahe Monch: For the love of this shit here niggaz are bloodthirsty 
 Try 
 M.o.p: load 
 P.M: Lock 
 M.o.p : hammer 
 P.M: Aim 
 M.O.P: Cock, (or) Drop (changes a few times) 
 (Lil' Fame) 
 Lil' Fame bring it live yo, that's what I strive fo' 
 I'ma settle this before you get to call 5-0 
 You wanna see me 4-5 blow? 
 Nigga put the phone down fo I dump 2 times 4 
 What you wan' cry fo? You know that my hammer is heavy 
 And it got kick like tae kwon do 
 Now you gwon die slow, I'ma show you how 
 To stretch a motherfucker if you wanna watch tae bo 
 (All): YO WE DOWN BY LAW 
 And when I hold this pound down fo 
 It's for me to put it down BY WAR 
 Shit is like downhill, I'ma make a nigga 
 Smell the corpse from King's County Morgue to Brownsville 
 (Oh!) Wrap your hood, and wave the flag 
 For almighty Pharoahe, Fizzie Womak, and Danze 
 (GUNS UP) Guns down 
 (FROM SUN UP) To sundown 
 Make ya sing till ya a la la la la la la la tdow! 
 (Billy Danze) 
 I'ma put you cowards in perspective 
 If you lookin' for child's play don't look my way 
 They have never gave me any credit 
 So I developed a homicide fetish, DEAL WIT IT MOTHAFUCKA! 
 It's yo call 
 It's only seven ways a nigga usually fall I'm abusin 'em all 
 Now where the real comers please stand, get up against the wall 
 (Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!) YES YES Y'ALL 
 Make it easy on yourself, Danze don't sleep 
 When I catch you on a creep 
 I'll lift the ground right from up under your feet 
 That's word to 'Lah 
 Be a man and prepare to die 
 It's the return of the hooded soldier, your man shoulda told ya 
 (Be cautious if it's walking sideways!)
