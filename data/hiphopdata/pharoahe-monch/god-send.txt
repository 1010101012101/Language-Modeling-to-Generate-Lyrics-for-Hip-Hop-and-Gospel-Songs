(Pharoahe Monch) 
 My mom is in the bedroom, cryin again 
 Sister's on the street corner, lyin' again 
 Just heard about another one of my niggaz dyin' again 
 I'm tryin' again to make moves... 
 I'll be damned if we go hungry 
 Ever since my pops passed the responsibilities belonged to me 
 This song you see is like an ode to God 
 That he blessed my last breath to be Allah you Akbar 
 And this city is hard, tenement buildings are barred 
 Incarcerated and scarred, no sentiment for when it becomes 
 Time for war I'm tryin' to score like Bernard King 
 My vocal box sling verbal cocaine like the GOVERNMENT 
 I told you I'd hurt the music 
 Travellin back, bustin' shots at {blank} before Christ was persecuted 
 Mathematically we live at right angles 
 Fuck the star spangled, the makers of fallen angels 
 Danglin from moon crescents, I persevere, breathe the air 
 Inhale the effervesence of life 
 This street game is stiflin I'm triflin upholdin a rifle 
 Peerin from behind the eyes of God, we at odds with ourselves 
 What is it worth when this - barren metropolis prevail 
 Scale the walls of hell - trail of a octopus...
