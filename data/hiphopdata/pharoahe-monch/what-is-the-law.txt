Officer Frank Pagliarule, heh 
 Shit, I hate spics and moolies on the trains 
 They be actin' insane and unruly 
 It's the "Planet of the Apes" 
 These gorillas be blastin' they tapes 
 Out of they cars like a cinematic movie 
 Respondin' to a domestic dispute, the culprit 
 A younger monkey who went ape-shit and decided to shoot 
 His older brother in the brain 
 His baby's mother couldn't refrain 
 Keepin' sex out the family name 
 And that keeps me smilin' 
 Like racial profilin' 
 Forever nigga pilin' 
 Inside Riker's Island 
 New York's most violent 
 Black wall of silence 
 React with black talons 
 When wolfpacks are wilin' 
 For a white cat 
 Gotta admit I can rap-ta-tat-tat 
 My nightstick on the top of your cap 
 My blackjack you'll be swallowin', for protestin' and hollerin' 
 The policy is quality of life and zero tolerance 
 What is the law? Know you heard this before 
 We find contraband in your car, we breakin' your jaw 
 What is the law? Nigga, mathematics, for sure 
 If they walkin' in packs of four, they tryin' to score 
 For any drug bust or cocaine, that's raw 
 Better believe we takin' our twenty percent at the door 
 What is the law? 
 Wolfpacks, movin' on all fours 
 I'm flawless with weaponry, mentally ready for war 
 What is the law? 
 What is the 
 Any formalities in the case of police brutality 
 I've escaped on finer details and minor technicalities 
 Here's a verbal medley of deadly force used 
 Readily abused in that old Ku Kluk pedigree 
 You better be heavily armed 
 Forever we ready your song 
 Steadily ready to move and bomb 'em 
 Like Hercules, when I work my knees 
 It's a search and seize that'll hurt indeed 
 God bless when the bullets hit the chest, you'll back-flip 
 SWAT - Special Weapons And Tactics; theatrics hot 
 On your block, we lock down all shenanigans 
 When we roll, you stand stiff like mannequins 
 Take the position for broomstick penetration (uh) 
 Legal under the mayor's new administration 
 You better forever have your identification 
 I broke the mold for holds that cause asphyxiation 
 What is the law? Know you heard this before 
 We find contraband in your car, we breakin' your jaw 
 What is the law? Nigga, mathematics for sure 
 If they walkin' in packs of four, they tryin' to score 
 For any drug bust or cocaine that's raw 
 Better believe we takin' our twenty percent at the door 
 What is the law? 
 Wolfpacks, movin' on all fours 
 I'm flawless with weaponry, mentally ready for war
