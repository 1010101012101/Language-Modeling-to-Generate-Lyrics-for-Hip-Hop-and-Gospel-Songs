 1st verse (pharoahe monch) 
 He pushed her down and called her black and ugly 
 She asked why must you tease me, 
 He laughed at her said your from Africa 
 Your hair is peasey 
 Your skin is dark and greasy 
 And plus you are so beneath me 
 Please trust me it wasn't easy 
 For diamond it scarred her deeply 
 Plays like a ??offender bass?? 
 To my self thought how much does gender play 
 Rememberin' such hatred at this tender age 
 If I could send a mental page 
 My thoughts would end the rage 
 Reminiscin' of the looks to her in class 
 I gave my eyes would say 
 Hook (erykah) 
 Hold on, I'm sure 
 There's so much more, to live for 
 If you hold on, things'll change 
 C'mon be strong 
 And hold on, I'm sure 
 There's so much more, to live for 
 As you grow strong things'll change 
 No pain, no gain 
 2nd verse 
 Please be willing to fight for your will to spite 
 Writings from Will-i-am lynch 
 Mill-i-ons tried to rise like helium 
 But died in the fields and the trenches 
 Cries from the killing is senseless 
 Eyes to the ceiling it quinches 
 A thirst in the feeling that's endless 
 The prize like a rain that rinses 
 The soul and cleanses ya mind 
 From white picketed fences 
 Heads up ya ass, splinters and face 
 Meant to they ride and ?bench us? 
 The masters pastored disaster 
 Them fascious bastards they crafted 
 This hazardous plan and still has us broken ??advanted?? 
 We shoulder the struggle 
 With the wieght of a boulder that muffles 
 The sound of provocative ????? the pieces of puzzles 
 Incompleted, 
 Only deleted to be push to the back of ya mind 
 Like a hairline that has receded 
 Now we repeated, 
 The process but never weeded the problem out 
 Heeded the warnings but never proceeded to solve it 
 No forward progress, its obvious the soul is gone, 
 I meditate and pray that these words will somehow allow you to... 
 3rd verse 
 See now diamond is priceless, 
 Timeless how she maneuvers like Heimlich 
 In this new world it reminds me of isis 
 She knows now that her complexion is a holy device 
 A protection from UV rays 
 In this negative time of crisis 
 Like a knife that butter slices 
 Easily to anger she reacts pious 
 Like a cell protectin itself from a virus 
 Twice as strong as her demeanor 
 Now she is Raekus 
 God is what you see now 
 When you peer inside her iris 
 Erykah 
 Diamond your so beautiful you can change this world if you want to girl oh ooh c'mon grow strong
