I, pledge allegiance 
 To all my homies who may never 
 Love a ho and never will 
 I, give my body 
 And I give my soul to the funk 
 May the funk, never end 
 (Nate Dogg) 
 I pledge allegiance, to paper chasers 
 To hustlers who be steady pulling capers 
 Peace and blessing, may the sun always shine on you 
 I'm serving paper, see ya later 
 I guess that's one mo' thing, I can't be faded 
 You can test me, get discombobulated 
 Ain't no question I'm goin' fuck with this 
 I do it for the funk of it 
 (Nate Dogg) 
 I pledge allegiance to my, homies who keep it gangsta 
 Fuck all the haters they can't stop this groove 
 I pledge allegiance to the, game cause it got me balling 
 Game don't wait so I'm not stalling 
 I'm still dissing, she's still calling 
 (Pharoahe Monch) 
 What, what, yeah 
 Check it out now, uh 
 See this is front line, no turning back now 
 I'm about to score, this is war on the track now (woo!) 
 Give me my vest and my ammo and my mac now 
 I'm 'bout to spit it, and Lord I'ma get it 
 In the worst way, slay, competition 
 Move the opposition, back wake the fuck up! (uh-huh) 
 'Cause when I get beyond enemy lines 
 I might snipe that ass like John Kennedy's mind 
 Thou shall not get caught, that's the remedy 
 Disinfect gun wounds on my last bottle of Hennessy 
 Bleed to let the seeds remember my memories 
 It's killed or be killed here son that's the penalty 
 RIDE for the funk, CRY for the funk 
 In the heat of night, I DIE for the funk 
 Pharoahe, when I'm six feet deep there's no grieving 
 Salute the noblest troop and pledge allegiance cause
