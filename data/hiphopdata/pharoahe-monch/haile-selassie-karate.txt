I said I ain't gangsta even though I grew up in the hood 
 I just wanna feed my people, so misunderstood 
 Strugglin (strugglin), hustlin (hustlin), tryin' to make it right 
 I just wanna spread the light to help us free our minds 
 Where you will only hear racial shit 
 E plural pursued 'em, all seein eye, ocular exam 
 The Apocalypse, back by popular demand 
 Innocuous but still leave a stage with blood in my hand for the populous 
 Put a fist in the sky 
 "Licensed to kill" italicized into my ID or "Rocky Illuminati" 
 Haile Selassie Karate, John "The Beast" Mugabi 
 King Jaffe in the lobby with the fur made of a lion 
 The eye of hoarse mouths, I am vibrant 
 Prominent constellations of Orion (whoa!) 
 The reason why my stars are in alignment (uh) 
 The renegade, Allahu Akbar, rock star 
 Tossin homemade grenades, CD's at NYPD cop cars 
 Just to get the revolution to pop off 
 Fraudulent stock, funded with Louis Vuitton knock-offs 
 Hijackin helicopters, detonate your metropolis 
 While I'm in the cockpit, politicin like Stephanopoulos 
 And my esophagus is quite atomic when I vomit 
 It's bioengineered urbanonomics 
 The formula truth divided by innovative ebonics 
 Times smooth lime, crushed ice and a splash of tonic 
 Nigga my past lies are astronomic 
 Smokin' hash in a cathedral with Nostradamus 
 At mass, discussin Martin Luther's "Free at Last" speech 
 Step on my British Walkers get your ass beat
