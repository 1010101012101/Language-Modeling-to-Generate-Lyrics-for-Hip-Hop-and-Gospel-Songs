DJ low key wad up 
 Somebody pray for these bitch 
 I love to sprawl on these bitch 
 I keep a K on me nigga 
 I keep a K on me nigga 
 I ain't no love for these bitches 
 Am making blood on these bitch 
 I keep a rubber on me bitch 
 I keep a rubber on me bitch 
 Feel while I drumming the stick 
 Y'all service pull up the hit 
 Jerry am hear that shit 
 Tell you bitch if you ain't slaughter quit 
 All the person in the order 
 Call the Uber she a boring bitch 
 Want a trap I got the starter kit 
 I stay with boot like a dora chick 
 Just another bad young nigga from the partments 
 Just another bad young nigga from the partments 
 Just another bad young nigga from the partments 
 Bitch I keep the choppa think I should a sell the Harley 
 I be in the kitchen whippin white iCarly 
 I don't play no game pussy boy this ain't Atari 
 Lyin' ass rappers man I'm tired of ya story 
 Lyin' ass ross bitch 
 Fake ass trappers bitch 
 Young Savage pull up 
 Roll the window down and clap you 
 I don't want that fishy pussy bitch you smell like snapper fish 
 I just pour the four of Activis inside the Snapple 
 Two two three hit a nigga look like he got tackled 
 All this Cuban links on me look like I got shackles 
 I got good finesse bitch, nigga you got gap tooth 
 The way I duck inside that pussy bitch 
 And say I shackle tackle bitch nigga please 
 Gas make me sneeze 
 Got her on her knees 
 So till you can't breathe 
 Young Savage yow pull on yo hoe 
 Pull her to to the yow you can't get a hoe 
 Just another bad young nigga from the partments 
 Just another bad young nigga from the partments 
 Just another bad young nigga from the partments 
 Just another bad young nigga from the partments 
 Bitch I keep a Choppa think I should sell the Harley 
 I be in the kitchen whippin white iCarly 
 I don't play no game pussy boy this ain't Atari 
 Lyin' ass rappers man I'm tired of ya story
