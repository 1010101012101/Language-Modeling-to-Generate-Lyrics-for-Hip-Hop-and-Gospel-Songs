Yesterday is just a dream I don't remember 
 Tomorrow, still a hope I've yet to endure 
 I'm out of time, I'm out of rhyme, I'm out of reason 
 Season's change and leave me out in the cold, 
 The story's old, the tale been told by many scholar 
 Got a fistful of dollar and pocketful of love 
 God above if you hear me cryin' 
 I've tried to sell my soul but no one's buyin' 
 Lord, strike me down now if I'm lyin' 
 Bronx Style Bob: Lord strike me down (3x) 
 It's gettin' cold It's time for dyin' 
 Come on and watch me shine 
 Like the world is mine (check it out) today 
 Come on and watch me shine (check it out) 
 Like the world is mine today 
 Watch me shine (check it out) 
 Let the man who's free from sin 
 Bronx Style Bob: free from sin 
 Cast the first stone and begin the violence 
 Bronx Style Bob: begin the violence 
 Let the man whose words ring true 
 Speak on up till his voice breaks through the silence 
 Bronx Style Bob: through the silence 
 Let the ones who lose their way 
 Live to see just one more day in the sunshine 
 Bronx Style Bob: La-la-la-la-la-la-laaa 
 Let the ones who choose to stray 
 Recognize the prize they'll pay In their lifetime 
 Bronx Style Bob: in their lifetime (2x) 
 Sittin' you wait for my roads to cross 
 You nail me down and you watch me bleed 
 Bronx Style Bob: watch me bleed 
 So lay my head against the earth 
 Plant my body like a seed 
 Bronx Style Bob: plant my body like a seed 
 You can't always get the things you want, love (check it out) 
 Bronx Style Bob: tell me what you want 
 Get what you deserve or maybe what you need 
 Bronx Style Bob: Uh, tell me what you need 
 So fill my hole with precious dirt, love 
 Till the soil and part the weed
