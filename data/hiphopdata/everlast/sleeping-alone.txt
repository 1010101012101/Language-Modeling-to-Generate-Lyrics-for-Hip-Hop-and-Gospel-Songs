*Phone Rings* 
 (Hello?) 
 (Hey is she home yet?) 
 (No, she's not home yet) 
 (All right, thanks) 
 Try to get you on the phone 
 But your mother always says you're gone 
 And you ain't coming home 
 Girl I'm sleeping alone 
 Try to get you on the line 
 And ask you to be mine 
 But you're so hard to find 
 Girl I'm sleeping alone 
 Baby girl she makes the good motion 
 Make no mistake she's deep as the ocean 
 Jake never sleeps in the heart of the city 
 And God'll never make another woman this pretty 
 And I can never guess why she even messed wit' me 
 Word to P.Diddy 
 I treated her shitty 
 I'm sick of cliches like opposites attract 
 When they drop the drum track 
 Screaming "Baby come back" 
 Reality bites like pit bull fights 
 I jump outta bed and throw on my lights 
 Your clothes are all gone 
 And you ain't there 
 And your makeup drawer is empty 
 I found an old picture of you washing your hair 
 And now we ain't even friendly 
 Try to get you on the phone 
 But your mother always says you're gone 
 And you ain't coming home 
 Girl I'm sleeping alone 
 Try to get you on the line 
 And beg you to be mine 
 But you're so hard to find 
 Girl I'm sleeping alone 
 Ain't too many kids that bang like this shorty 
 She'll sip champagne 
 She'll come drink a forty 
 Got a smell that intice 
 Dress kinda sporty 
 In public she's nice 
 In private she's naughty 
 I had every man's dream in the palm of my hand 
 And fucked it all up like the Taliban 
 She left town with my ring and wrecked all our plans 
 And I don't even care about the fifty grand 
 Man the hell with the cash cause that ain't the point 
 We used to sit around and laugh as we smokin' the joint 
 We used to watch TV and eat chicken wings 
 We had tickle fights 
 We did the wild things 
 Now I'm all alone up in my room 
 This house is feelin' empty 
 We used to talk about being bride and groom 
 And now we ain't even friendly 
 Try to get you on the phone 
 But your mother always says you're gone 
 And you ain't coming home 
 Girl I'm sleeping alone 
 Try to get you on the line 
 And beg you to be mine 
 But you're so hard to find 
 Girl I'm sleeping alone 
 Me corazon 
 Ain't comin' home 
 The sweetest thing I've ever known 
 Turned off her phone 
 Left me alone 
 The pain that cuts down to the bone 
 It can't be fixed 
 Scars don't heal 
 None of these chiks out here is real 
 Some of these chicks got sex appeal 
 But their souls all come up empty 
 Put me in the mix, girl, what's the deal? 
 All I'm trying to be is friendly 
 Try to get you on the phone 
 But your mother always says you're gone 
 And you ain't coming home 
 Girl I'm sleeping alone 
 Try to get you on the line 
 And beg you to be mine 
 But you're so hard to find 
 Girl I'm sleeping alone
