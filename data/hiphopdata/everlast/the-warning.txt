This is the warning'I warned you baby x3 (sample) 
 Back of the liqueur store bout' to blaze this joint 
 Got some dice in my hand 
 My man says six is your point 
 Trying to hit the hard way so I can break like Steve Miller 
 Take the money then I run son 
 I'm a lover and a killer 
 This is the warning'I warned you baby x3 (sample) 
 I feel like god and the devil 
 I'm a saint 
 I'm a sinner 
 I'm a hard rocking' 
 Hard headed 
 Hard sick summer winner 
 I'm a kush blazing' 
 Bush chasing 
 Product of the city 
 And I ain't asking for your love 
 And I don't want your pity 
 So girl don't talk about me shitty 
 Don't act all high and ditty 
 If your man keep playing me funny 
 I'mma come take all his money 
 And leave him holy from this blessing 
 With my four pound smith and Wesson 
 Better watch out who you're stressing 
 Fuck around you'll learn your lesson 
 This is the warning'I warned you baby x3 (sample) 
 Back of the liqueur store trying to break these chumps 
 Bunch of heads in a circle, daddy's handing out lumps 
 Trying to shake these bones 
 I'm trying to get these shoes 
 But yo they all think Whitey's cheating 
 Cause tonight I can't lose. 
 They wanna take my funds 
 But I'mma blaze my guns 
 We're burning sensations 
 And heart palpitations 
 Why you breathing so heavy 
 While your palms are sweaty 
 And if you thinking bout' a stick' move 
 Word to god you ain't ready 
 This is the warning'I warned you baby x3 (sample)
