I met a woman in West Virginia 
 She said her name was Alabama 
 She from a little town outside Savannah 
 Where everybody talk that country grammar 
 She said she killed a man down in Atlanta 
 He beat her and he drank till he couldn't stand up 
 He told her that he loved her but he couldn't stand her 
 She caught him in his sleep hit him with a hammer 
 Then she sold her car and she bought a gun 
 Johnny Law got her on the run 
 Another broken bottle and the damage done 
 We've all been blinded by the sun 
 Blinded by the sun... 
 Her breathe was sweet, her eyes were pretty 
 She said her zodiac sign was cancer 
 She was on her way to New York City 
 Trying to get a job there as a dancer 
 Then she asked if she could ride home with me 
 Now I'm still thinking on the answer 
 She pulled on love She don't take pity 
 She'll break your heart if you give her the chance to 
 If Grandma's got an Uzi and it weighs a ton 
 Johnny Law got her on the run 
 Another broken bottle and the damage done 
 We've all been blinded by the sun, blinded by the sun 
 Sun sun sun 
 Lord have mercy on me for all the things I've done 
 I've lost my mind, my eyes were blinded by the sun 
 Don't forsake me Lord I'm not the only one 
 I've lost my mind, my eyes were blinded by the sun 
 Blinded by the sun 
 And Grandma's got an Uzi and it weighs a ton 
 Johnny Law got her on the run 
 Another Broken bottle and the damage done 
 We've all been blinded by the sun 
 Blinded by the sun.
