Na-Na-Nah-Na, Na-Na-Nah-Na, Hey, Hey, Hey... Goodbye! 
 Goodbye, it's over 
 We're through 
 It's done 
 Our relationship is no longer one on one 
 So I guit girl 
 I don't need this 
 I'm disgraced 
 'Cause in my face 
 You spit 
 I quit stepin' out wit another guy 
 After givin' you my love I deserve to know why 
 How long has this been going on 
 How long have you been doin' me wrong 
 You thought I didn't know 
 You thought I wouldn't go 
 Well, that's why I'm makin' this song 
 To say goodbye 
 Na-Na-Nah-Na, Na-Na-Nah-Na, Hey, Hey, Hey... Goodbye! (2x) 
 Pack your bags 
 Get out of sight 
 I won't see you with a man on any night 
 You try to play me like a fool 
 But now you see you've been schooled 
 By the E 
 And it's plain to see 
 You thought you had luck like a four-leaf clover 
 Well, your luck just ran out 
 Home girl it's over 
 I hope you had a lot a fun 
 Were you lyin' when you said I'm numba 1 
 Well, I guess it don't matter 
 It makes no difference 
 I caught you wit' a smokin' gun 
 Or so to speak 
 Girl you a natural born sneak 
 And the hand you delt me was really weak 
 But that's all right, you won't see me cryin' 
 I brush a girl off when I catch her lyin' 
 So when I toss you out 
 Don't dare ask why 
 Don't try to return wit' a tear in your eye 
 That's just my way of sayin' goodbye... 
 Na-Na-Nah-Na, Na-Na-Nah-Na, Hey, Hey, Hey... Goodbye! (2x) 
 Usin' me, 
 Confusin' me, 
 Inside you abusin' me 
 You think I'll stick around so you can keep abusing me 
 Wise up girl, I ain't playin', 
 You try to make it better sayin' 
 Let's hit the hey and make love 
 Then I know that your loyal 
 But I can't take the stress, I don't need the termoil 
 You told me that you love me but it was a lie 
 You know that I care, but I must say goodbye 
 Who is it that you thinkin' about when we kissin' 
 And when we all alone is it him that you're missin' 
 I couldn't stand the feelin' when I see another man in my spot next to you 
 So what you want me to do? 
 Forget about it? 
 Act like it never happened? 
 Turn the other cheek and wait to get slapped again? 
 Or until you say when? 
 You're through with me but you will see 
 I'll be the first to say b-y-e 
 So when I toss you out don't dare ask why, 
 It's just my way of sayin' goodbye 
 Na-Na-Nah-Na, Na-Na-Nah-Na, Hey, Hey, Hey... Goodbye! (2x) 
 I must admit it, you hit it well 
 Did you get your kicks puttin' me through hell 
 Runnin' around with your new found child, he's not a man 
 He can't get wild, but that's all right, girl, you made your choice 
 And maybe by now you're sick of my voice, but it's too bad 
 'Cause you made me mad, 
 And I'm gonna show you all the things that you might've had 
 Then you'll be the one feeling pain and misery 
 Regretting the past (goodbye) 
 'Cause you're history 
 So when I toss you out don't dare ask why, 
 Don't tug at my sleeve as I walk by 
 Don't try to return with a tear in your eye, 
 It's just my way of sayin' goodbye 
 Na-Na-Nah-Na, Na-Na-Nah-Na, Hey, Hey, Hey... Goodbye! (2x)
