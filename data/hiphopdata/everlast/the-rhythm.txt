Voice: 
 The rhythm is both the songs manicle 
 And it's demanicle charge... 
 The rhythm (20x), 
 I'm Everlast born to be a caucassion 
 But it makes no difference what persuasion you are 
 As long as you know how to get up on the floor 
 And start workin' a sweat 
 To a musical measure that makes you move 
 As soon as the needle drops into the groove 
 So get up and dance to the gift I'm giving, 
 Forget about your troubles get into the rhythm 
 The rhythm (Talking about the rhythm) (10x)... 
 Yo, yo, you know what the world needs? 
 Rhythm! 
 The rhythm (Talking about the rhythm) (10x)... 
 You linger for the rap singer, 
 When Donald D brings the party to the deal 
 My presence is felt world wide 
 You don't dance to this it's suicide 
 Put your hands into the air on, the M.C. cop, 
 The girlies are pipen' hot 
 Natorious Lama is how I'm livin' 
 Don't step to me step to the rhythm 
 Step to the rhythm 
 The rhythm (Talking about the rhythm) (10x)... 
 You make me feel so hot like I said before we need rhythm, 
 The rhythm (Talking about the rhythm) (5x)... 
 All we need is rhythm... 
 Listen to the tracks that rolls, 
 Watch the mic as it glows 
 The lethal weapon got you trapped in this dance mode 
 Ice-T's throwin' words at you like dodge ball y'all 
 You gotta move get hit, if you get hit, you fall, 
 No jokin', no boastin' and no bragging 
 Grip the mic like a .44 magnum, 
 Dust you off if you suck 'cause I ain't 
 You want me to write soft rhyme's, 
 Sorry, I can't, 
 I write the rhythm 
 The rhythm (Talking about the rhythm) (10x)... 
 We need rhythm for the world to have peace and unity 
 We must first have... 
 BOOM!
