I said God wanna fill my heart 
 The devil wanna wear my skin 
 Time to get the party started, everybody jump in 
 (You got it) 
 God wanna fill my heart 
 The devil wanna wear my skin 
 Time to get the party started, everybody jump in 
 (You got it) 
 I'm gonna bounce, rock, skate, tune in, drop out, demotivate 
 Renegotiate for the proper rate 
 Some that push weight have to go upstate 
 And fucking jail bait is statutory rape 
 And don't you never get your ass caught on tape 
 This ain't New York, there ain't no escape 
 And Superman's just another pimp in a cape 
 And even if both your eyes come up snake 
 It's time to get wise, rise, and cut the cake 
 Don't take much for the Earth to quake 
 So watch what you clutch when you're on the take 
 I'm trying to tell you, God wanna fill my heart 
 The devil wanna wear my skin 
 Time to get the party started, everybody jump in 
 (You got it) 
 God wanna fill my heart 
 The devil wanna wear my skin 
 Time to get the party started, everybody jump in 
 (You got it) 
 I don't know where I'm going, I hardly know where I've been 
 The only thing I know for sure, the party's 'bout to begin 
 (You got it) 
 A thousand angels dancing, all on the head of a pin 
 Some people live for righteousness, some people live for sin 
 (You got it) 
 God wanna fill my heart 
 The devil wanna wear my skin 
 Time to get the party started, everybody jump in 
 (You got it) 
 God wanna fill my heart 
 The devil wanna wear my skin 
 Time to get the party started, everybody jump in 
 (You got it) 
 Everybody jump in, Lord, everybody jump in 
 Everybody jump in, Lord, everybody jump in 
 (You got it) 
 Yo, I'm a pimp, I'm a thief, I'm a killer, I'm a dealer 
 I'm a holy man, preacher, I'm a teacher, I'm a healer 
 I'm a mover, I'm a shaker, I'm a giver, I'm a taker 
 I'm a longtime, bonafide, big money maker 
 I'm a winner, I'm a loser, I'm a begger, I'm a chooser 
 I'm a thug, I'm a boozer, I'm a chronic drug user 
 I've been rapping, I've been mixing 
 I'm facting and I'm fiction 
 I'm a walking, talking, living, breathing contradiction 
 I'm working for my God, but I'm playing with the devil 
 Don't act like you can see me, 'cause I'm on another level 
 I'm a mic burner, not a Trik Turner 
 I'll act like Ike Turner, then I'll treat you like Tina 
 God wanna fill my heart 
 The devil wanna wear my skin 
 Time to get the party started, everybody jump in 
 (You got it) 
 God wanna fill my heart 
 The devil wanna take my soul 
 Daddy got a broken heart, the party's gotten out of control 
 The party's gotten out of control, y'all, the party's gotten out of control 
 The party's gotten out of control, y'all, the party's gotten out of control 
 (You got it) 
 (You got it)
