Yeah Yeah 
 Whitey Ford and the likwit 
 2000 zero zero 
 Party just started 
 I got the complex subjects 
 The roughneck stature 
 The jerk factor results and bone fractures 
 Manufactured sounds and images 
 Got me scramblin' like football scrimages 
 Johnny Unitis 
 In god I trust 
 I don't need to get paper every time I bust 
 Maybe I'll do it for charity 
 Now my label want to jerk me for my royalty 
 I guess that's what you get for loyalty 
 Life's a bitch don't take the shit personally 
 Life's a bitch don't take it personally (3x) 
 Life's a bitch don't take it personal 
 Call me a visionary advasary 
 Known to bust cherry on a young berry 
 Now tell me how much weight can your back carry 
 And tell me how far have you come now 
 I'm sick of all these fake rock B-boys who think they down 
 'Cause they got a tattoo and turn their hat round 
 Their all my sons just call me Sam 
 Recognize who I am boy we ain't fam 
 This ain't the sopranos 
 You know I roll with the rhythm cubanos 
 And billions get served like McDonalds 
 So get the fuck on before I give you a tray 
 Year though I ride through the calley in my blinged up whip 
 I don't fear no evil pumpin' full clip 
 'Cause you ain't nothin' but a bitch to me 
 By 2002 you'll be history 
 Yo I motivate to propagate my oral linguistic 
 Mystical science act of defiance 
 Bitches get slapped on non-compliance 
 Catgorize me with industry giants 
 I'm callin shots like my man chick hearn 
 I can mix your burn while you wait your turn 
 I get respect in this here and that's hard to earn 
 I don't do it for the paper I got money to burn 
 My sole motivation is rock the whole nation 
 Make a rhodes scholar out of a dust patient 
 All you drug addicts with the thug tatics 
 You might go to jail if the charge really sticks 
 Life's a bitch don't take it personally (7x) 
 Life's a bitch don't take it personal
