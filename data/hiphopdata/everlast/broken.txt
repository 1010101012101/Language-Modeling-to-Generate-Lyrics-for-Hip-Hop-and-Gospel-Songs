You're the air that I breathe 
 The sun when it breaks through the clouds 
 You're all that I need 
 But I know that you're having some doubts 
 I'm down on my knees 
 I pray that you'll stick this out 
 Beggin' you please girl 
 I'm sorry I let you down 
 I'm broken like a promise 
 I'm shattered like a dream 
 I'm broken with all my pieces scattered 'round for you to see 
 I'm broken like a record 
 I sing the same old song 
 I'm broken like the heart of a man that's run away from love too long 
 Girl what about you 
 What about you girl 
 It's so hard to speak 
 I can barely look you in the eye 
 It's so hard to breathe 
 I know I ain't afraid to die 
 Your breath is so sweet 
 Your kisses could get me high 
 My heart is so weak 
 But your loving could get me by 
 I'm broken like a promise 
 I'm shattered like a dream 
 I'm broken with all my pieces scattered 'round for you to see 
 I'm broken like a record 
 I sing the same old song 
 I'm broken like the heart of a man that's run away from love too long 
 Girl what about you 
 What about you girl 
 I'm broken like a promise 
 I'm shattered like a dream 
 I'm broken with all my pieces scattered 'round for you to see 
 I'm broken like record 
 I sing the same old song 
 I'm broken like the heart of a man that's run away from love too long 
 Girl what about you 
 What about you girl 
 Girl what about you 
 What about you girl 
 Girl what about you
