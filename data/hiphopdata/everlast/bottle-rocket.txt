Yo the rhyme excursions touch minds like brain surgeons 
 Feel the lyric tear gas even on clean versions 
 No profanic goddammit hard like granite to the utmost 
 I'm butter on rye, always high but play the low post 
 I stretch to go the distance yo my lungs are mad elastic 
 I'm dope on plastic like Flex, and always keep it, classic 
 Expressions in the facial, I'm on rachel from Caribbean rhythms 
 I hit 'em wit' a battered flow pattern then circle Saturn twice 
 I'm nice on ice The line slice your dome and separate rhymes from poems 
 My life, ain't tryin' to see no Grammy or Oscar 
 Best believe the styles will rub off like pastas 
 On people, yo check Dilated, Evidence 
 The influential rock rhymes in sequential format 
 You see the doormat if you acting dis-accordingly 
 Something to the effect of Fat Boys in Disorderly's 
 I'll take you from He-Man to She-Ra 
 Battle Cat to Cringer 
 Medieval messenger, west coast avenger 
 Take you to the street, battle me that's a fuckin' sin 
 Go one round wit Madchild, you'll be suckin' wind 
 Snappin' handcuffs just from deep concentration 
 Then I broke out the bus, the mental hospital patient 
 On the weekend pass, but I still come sick 
 Psychopathic, you're dealin' with a deranged lunatic 
 Soon to kick ya teeth in and then go berserk 
 Even Van Gogh looked at me, 
 And said "You're one piece of work" 
 So I said "Lend me an ear" 'cause I'm the state of the art 
 First I'll feast on your brain and rip your body apart 
 There's a part of your heart stuck in between my fangs 
 Wrap a rope 'round your neck and you still couldn't hang 
 'Cause you're way off track you need realignment 
 Murdering masterpieces in solitary confinement 
 I keep your backside open like the English Channel 
 I rock the sure shot, I keep it hot like flannel 
 I'll survey your panel, put my foot up in your anal 
 You think it can't happen, kid 'cause I'm rappin' 
 Ain't no gun clappin', cut the jaw-jackin ' 
 Let the joints get shot and see who wear this knot 
 Then kick off your shoes jump off my jock 
 And check the new style Whitey Ford's prone to rock 
 'Cause once upon a time, not long ago 
 Before hip hop was made for the radio 
 An MC show had to cold rock the masses 
 Used to wear a Kangol wit the clear Gazel glasses 
 So bang bang boogey, up jump the party 
 Someone clapped off, and scattered everybody 
 Drunk off Bacardi, high off the trauma 
 It's death from above, the livest dive bomber 
 In the squadron 
 I break formation 
 I get New York love like my name's King Sun 
 I T La Rock Bells till they break the dawn 
 Steady puffin L's, I fight hell like Spawn 
 My moves are animated, my crew's reinstated 
 While you cats suspensions are up in my dimensions 
 We can ease tensions or we can get rowdy 
 So I'm a keep it on the love and do my duty like Howdie 
 Direct your short term plan, rigidalize rhyme boards wit the hoards 
 I'm Satan dynasty killer reveal the cause wit the sling on down 
 Venom spit regurgitate death scripts I sound 
 Cylinder never python, Prevail Madchild 
 Physical justice can't rush this for now 
 Move faker the game time set back so don't sweat that 
 God don't test that, too much infinite to get at 
 Face the fields Swollen Members got the iller drills 
 And if you wit the rhyme steel 
 Bust the revealings in my feelings of these dealings 
 I went to represent shield 
 I build three phases of death, 
 The illusion is the sweat that you reflect 
 When you feel the veil Divine Styles circum navigate nine circles of hell 
 You keep on you don't stop 'cause a nigga never stay still 
 Whatta whattta whatta whatta whattta what I'm sayin' is-is that 
 You-you ain't ready for that chill
