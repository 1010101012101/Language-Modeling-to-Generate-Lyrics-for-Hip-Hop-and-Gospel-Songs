{On behalf of PanAm Airlines, 
 We'd like to be the first to welcome you to New York City. 
 We'd like to thank you for flying PanAm. 
 The local time is 6:45 AM and the temperature is 89 degrees.} 
 I been up all night 
 On the red-eye flight 
 The dawn's early light 
 Got the skyline bright 
 We in the back of a car service 
 The driver's kinda nervous 
 'Cause I'm tokin' on a blunt that's fat 
 He say, "You know where you at?" 
 I say, "I know where I am 
 And if you really want a tip, 
 Then Mr. don't get flam 
 I ain't tryin' to be rude 
 And I ain't stressin' you, Gramps, 
 But this shit right here, 
 It be the breakfast of champs 
 I been tokin' on this 
 Since I was 13 years old 
 And when I look up at my wall 
 I see platinum and gold 
 And ain't nobody sneezin' 
 At the money I fold 
 And I ain't here for your pleasin', 
 So put that shit on hold 
 Just keep yoor mouth shut 
 And get me to the hotel 
 And turn the radio up 
 While I finish this L" 
 {Welcome back to the 5 Seasons, Mr. Ford. 
 Your usual room is ready and waiting. 
 Let me take your luggage. 
 If you need anything while you're staying, 
 Just let me know.} 
 I hop out my car 
 Step into the lobby 
 Everybody's on the floor 
 It's a motherfuckin' robbery 
 The shit's in progress 
 I can feel the stress 
 I whisper silently to God, 
 "How'd I get in this mess?" 
 They tell me to freeze 
 And get down on my knees 
 Between my jewels and my cash, 
 I'm holdin' 35Gs 
 They told me to run it 
 So I got bold and I fronted 
 Like Slick Rick said, 
 I know I shouldn't've done it 
 'Cause now they're standin' over me 
 Watchin' me bleed 
 Damn, I got to quit 
 Smokin' all this weed 
 There's a pain in my chest, 
 But, yo, I must be blessed 
 Because before I faded out 
 I saw an EMS 
 The paramedics 
 They greet me with some anesthetics 
 They killin' my pain 
 They screamin' my name 
 They're tryin' to keep me in the conscious world 
 I'm thinkin' 'bout my mom, my sister, and my girl 
 I'm prayin' to God, 
 "Don't let this go too far" 
 As they rush me 
 Into the St. Luke's OR 
 They pull the bullets out my chest 
 Give 'em back in a jar 
 Now I'm wearin' this scar 
 'Cause I tried to play hard 
 {Mr. Ford, I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. 
 (What you talkin' about?) 
 It would appear that one of the bullets grazed your spine, 
 And damaged your cord. 
 (So what're you tryin' to tell me?) 
 Well, suffice it to say, 
 I don't think you'll be jumping around anymore.} 
 Yo, this can't happen to me 
 I just can't believe it 
 I'm trapped in a wheelchair 
 A paraplegic 
 There ain't no rehab 
 There ain't no therapy 
 For the rest of my life 
 Somebody's gotta take care of me 
 And people stare at me 
 With pity in their eyes 
 And every morning I rise 
 To a life I dispise 
 And every night 
 I think I might 
 Never rock the mic again 
 'Cause my brain's fucked up 
 On Percocet and Vicodin 
 Might as well be heroin 
 Pulsin' through my veins 
 Gotta kill these pains 
 Or blow out my brains 
 To free me from these chains 
 I'm trapped in this physical hell 
 To walk again, I just might sell my soul 
 And I'm only 20-some'in' years old
