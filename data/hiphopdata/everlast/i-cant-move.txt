Watchin' the sunshine, peekin' over the skyline 
 Thinkin' I gotta get mine, gotta try at least one time 
 Wanna get near it, close enough to fear it, close enough to hear it 
 Close enough to say that I looked it in the eye and then I turned away 
 And I'm not scared, but I can't move 
 I'm not scared, but I can't move 
 Hangin' out on the weeknight, lookin' out on the street light 
 Gettin' into some fistfight, tryin' to cling to my birthright 
 I wanna get near her, close enough to smell her 
 Close enough to tell her 
 All the things that I wanna say, then I looked her in the eye, 
 Made her run away 
 And I don't care (don't care), but I can't move 
 I don't care (don't care), but I can't move 
 Layin' up at the Soho, lookin' out of my window 
 Pullin' back on some indo, watchin' breeze as the wind blows 
 Wanna get near it, close enough to hear it, close enough to fear it 
 Close enough to say, that I looked it in the eye, then it turned away 
 And I'm not scared (not scared), but I can't move 
 I'm not scared (not scared), but I can't move
