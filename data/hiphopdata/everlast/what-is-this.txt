This is Everlast (6x)... 
 Step up while I inject an overdose of intallect 
 An overload of my vibrations better yet a new sensation 
 I was lost but then he found me no corruption dissed around me 
 I was taken to a higher, level of funkdifia where souls of men were burned 
 They were taught but did not learn about the ricious laws of God 
 Who threw the seeds over the side, takin' roots and tryin' to grow 
 Though the process might be slow please stay with my question 
 What is this? (This is Everlast) (5x)... 
 (Scratch) Wha wha what wha what is thi wha what is this? (2x)... 
 Not speakin' on my physical, mental or my horror 
 I'm speakin' on my soul for the burn would beat you whore 
 There's no such thing as love of your life, it's the hands of the God 
 So don't treat his ricious laws with blatant disreguard 
 In order to follow the Lords path here is what you must do 
 Do onto each of your brothers as you have done to you 
 This golden rule is all you need and you'll be rewarded 
 The man that don't will pay the price and believe me you can't afford it 
 Because 
 This is Everlast 
 What is this? (This is Everlast) (3x) 
 (Scratch) wha what wha what is is thi this? 
 This is for the one-two war of over who's God is the right one 
 Can it be the Asian one, the black one or could it be the white one 
 The answer to the question isn't controversial 
 There is only one God and his love is universal 
 If you sit in great redemption all you need to do is ask him 
 Then you will be both prepared for a life that is Everlasting 
 So take heed to the word's I'm sayin', grab a good book and get hip 
 To the teachings of the holy coral or the Bible's holy scripture 
 Because 
 What is this? (This is Everlast) (5x)... 
 What is this? (This is Everlast) (4x)... 
 Who is this? (This is Everlast) (2x)... 
 WHAT IS THIS??! (This is Everlast)
