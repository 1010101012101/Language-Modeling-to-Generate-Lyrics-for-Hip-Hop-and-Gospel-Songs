I got my pick up truck, and I got my gun, and I got a taste for whiskey and pills. 
 I know I'm kinda far, 'cause I'm my father's son and I got a hole in my heart I can't fill 
 Turn off the parking light, down by the rivers end. 
 This is my darkest night girl you're swimming in my head 
 It happens all the time, I blow it every time 
 People change with time 
 Call me anytime girl 
 I miss you oh so often 
 What's been said is done 
 It's my only option girl I'll be anyone for you. 
 Anyone. 
 Out on the interstate, I play my radio 
 And I confess to all my sins 
 Been driving seven hours, still got 3 to go 
 Where it always ends, the road begins 
 You've got your broken wings 
 I've got mine sewn apart 
 Girl all these fucked up things 
 They keep us torn apart 
 It happens all the time 
 I blow it every time 
 People change with time 
 Call me anytime you like 
 I miss you oh so often 
 What's been said is done 
 It's my only option 
 Ill kill anyone for you. 
 Anyone 
 Anywhere 
 Anytime 
 For you 
 *Repeat until fade*
