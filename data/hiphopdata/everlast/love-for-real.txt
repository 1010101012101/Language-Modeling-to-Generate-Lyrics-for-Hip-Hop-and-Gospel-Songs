Her skin was soft and sweet 
 She wore sandles on her feet 
 Side by side we fell asleep in her mother's bed 
 She stepped inside of me 
 Said don't ever lie to me 
 This heart of mine can be yours 
 Yeah that's what she said 
 But I just played the role 
 Broke the heart I stole 
 'Cause I was young and domb 
 And fucked up in the head 
 Do you want to be loved for real 
 Do you want to be loved for real 
 Do you want to be 
 (Do you want to be loved) loved 
 (Yes I want to be loved for real) for real 
 (Do you want to be loved for real yes I want to be loved forreal) 
 Now down by the river 
 Taken off my shoes 
 Jumpin' in the water 
 Wash away these blues 
 Now it's an ocean 
 The current takes over 
 Words already be spoken 
 Tales already been told 
 Hearts already been broken 
 Wounds already been healed 
 Do you want to be loved 
 Do you want to 
 Do you want to be loved for real 
 Do you want to be loved for real 
 Do you want to be loved for real 
 Do you want to be 
 (Do you want to be loved) loved 
 (Yes I want to be loved for real) for real 
 (Do you want to be loved for real yes I want to be loved forreal) 
 Do you want to be 
 (Do you want to be) loved (loved for real) 
 (Yes I want to be loved for real) For Real 
 (Do you want to be loved for real yes I want to be loved forreal) 
 Her eyes were hazel brown 
 She laughed the sweetest sound 
 And I just loved the way she light up when she spoke 
 She helped to easy my pain 
 She stand in pourin rain 
 And I gave her all that she could take till she broke 
 She fit me like a glove 
 She taught me how to love 
 And for some ass I watched it all go up in smoke 
 Do you want to be loved for real 
 Do you want to be loved for real 
 Do you want to be 
 (Do you want to be loved) loved 
 (Yes I want to be loved for real) for real 
 (Do you want to be loved for real yes I want to be loved forreal)
