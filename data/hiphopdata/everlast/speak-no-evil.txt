I'm in the studio with my brotha the half asiatic 
 You know the fraction of black skin and a smidget of white 
 It's my brotha Kool Nick 
 And we about to drop some science on the this track 
 About God and what not and the world... 
 Step up and bow your head 
 Be grateful your hungry for knowledge 
 I'm serving a plate full of 12 course meals 
 And a black plate of of wax through MC's 
 Sit back and relax 
 Try to digest the data that I feed you 
 I'm actin' this way 'cause I'm bred to the color of my skin 
 Something I take pride in 
 Still my people insist on hidin' behind the American dream 
 And it's like the home of the free 
 And mom's apple pie 
 I got whiped for the meltin' pod 
 I guess not 
 Kid stuck up for his rights and got shot 
 Yah, I speak no evil (2x) 
 Yo, Nick do me a favor 
 Step up! 
 (Kool Nick) 
 His world is crazy 
 It must be sick 
 Be like Nick 
 Get ricious real quick 
 Jews, Muslims, Buddha Baptists 
 Brought up like the Merry Christmas 
 See salvation 
 Every pinch of this rhyme is from my heart 
 And I meant this 
 Jesus... Scattered his blood for me 
 He hung on a cross 
 You know that story 
 Nowadays a lot of people are trying to worship Satan 
 But your gonna fry in hell 
 I'm never burning up forever 
 The forcast see no change in weather 
 Damn', the Devil would never twist this mind with the mark of the 666 
 Thanks God there no one equal 
 That's why I speak no evil (2x) 
 Listen to the story of my savor 
 And how he gave up life to let us live 
 That's a hell of a gift to give 
 Kick it E 
 Now as I take a look around 
 I don't see many people down 
 With my cars... Ha, that's scary 
 Tryin' to diss the son of Marry 
 You being lord take the bait 
 And fall into the trap of Satan 
 Then your life's over without no sequal 
 That's why I speak no evil (2x) 
 Yo, this is weird rhymin' 
 Strange brothers are gettin' shaked on the streets with gold chains 
 Some smoke crack, cocaine, and Jumbo fried 
 When they talk mumbo 
 How can this be society 
 I front the place where none of us want to be 
 People gettin' judged by the skin tone 
 It wasn't like this way back with the Flinstones! 
 Some times I get kept back because I'm half black 
 People can't except that, yoexcept me for what I am 
 What did I do 
 Becasue none of us give a damn 
 All they want is to drive a Mercedes 
 Half a million dollars... 
 And live like the Brady's! 
 But anyways time is winding 
 Not grinding 
 LLok in your heart and start finding peace and love 
 No matter what your grade is understand the knowledge at hand and believe this 
 I speak no evil! 
 Word up 
 We got my Ma Lofy in the house 
 Man, my boy Chris 
 My brother Low-Dog 
 My brother Bry 
 My lady T 
 Yo, we got Shawny, you what's up 
 My brother E over there 
 Hahaha, you know I speak no evil!
