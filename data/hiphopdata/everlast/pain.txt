Somewhere between the lies and truths, borderlines get shady. 
 Somewhere between the yeses and nos you can find a maybe. 
 Somewhere between the highs and lows you can spot the middle. 
 Somewhere between the questions and clues you can solve the riddle 
 Somewhere along the road you might need a place to stay. 
 Somewhere along the line you're gonna have to pass away. 
 And somewhere in space you still remind me of a reason. 
 And summertime you still smell like my favorite season. 
 And it feels like... Pain 
 It's just like... Pain 
 Love is like... Pain

 Somewhere between the mountain and sea a river is flowing 
 Somewhere between the earth and the sky, the winds of change are blowing 
 Somewhere between the two of us a space is growing 
 Somewhere between suspicion and trust are the things worth knowing. 
 Somewhere along the road you might want to hitch a ride 
 Somewhere along the line you're gonna have to swallow your pride 
 Somewhere inside you still remind me of a feeling 
 Somewhere deeper still are wounds that are not healing. 
 And it feels like... Pain 
 It's just like... Pain 
 Love is like... Pain 
 Some people like... Pain 
 Put your nails in my hand... Pain 
 Fill my eyes up with sand... Pain 
 Papercuts on my tongue... Pain 
 We're right back where we begun... Pain 
 Somehow I only hurt the ones who really mattered 
 Somehow she played her role although her soul was battered 
 Someday soon I know my ashes will be scattered 
 Someday soon I know my former becomes latter 
 And it feels like... Pain 
 It's just like... Pain 
 Love is like... Pain
