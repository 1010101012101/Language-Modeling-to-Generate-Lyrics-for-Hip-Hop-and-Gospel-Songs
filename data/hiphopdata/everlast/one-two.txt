(Everlast) 
 Yeah, yeah, two-thousand, zero, zero 
 The party just started, ha-ha, ha-ha 
 Everlast, Kurupt (Kurupt: Fred Wright Kurupt) 
 Goes somethin' like this 
 Chrous: 
 I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
 The good Lord knows just what you've been through 
 I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
 Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do 
 I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
 The good Lord knows just what you've been through 
 I say one, two, one-two-one-two 
 Sometime's you're just doing what you've got to do 
 (Everlast) 
 Sticker man tryin' to feed his baby 
 Drug dealer tryin' to raise his son 
 Every pimp gotta dress his lady 
 Come on now you ain't the only one 
 (Kurupt) 
 Now this is the combination of intervention 
 That just might open up a new dimension 
 I can tell, the well, just might run dry 
 Lost attentions and thoughts, mighty fine to simplify 
 (Kurupt) 
 I said life lasts present to the past 
 Saw a rapper the warpath (warpath) 
 Kurupt, young Goddie 
 Incredibly clever, mack author with Everlast it's true 
 Do what you want do 
 One, two 
 (Everlast) 
 Mary Jane wanna run smoke reefer 
 Little Ricky's out sniffin' rock 
 Cynthia, she's at the disco coked out 
 Doesn't matter what drugs you on 
 (Kurupt) 
 Gain, growth, life by a oath 
 The gifted, different toast 
 Talent, the melodramatic 
 And the violent life in silence 
 B ut this here's mine, crystal clear it's mine
