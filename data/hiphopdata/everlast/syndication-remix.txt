Dope new styles and rhymes breaking science 
 Down with the Rhyme syndicate alliance 
 You wanna tip it in the crack of the whip 
 You know the saying about ships and slips with a lip 
 You'll be sunk while I'll be gettin' drunk 
 With the bottle of rose-a I keep the mike drunk punk 
 Don't try to get none know where I'm comin' from 
 I don't care if you do got a gun 
 You better step off before I go off and don't dare buck with a showoff 
 'Cause then ill break hard you'll think I'm a fanatic 
 Speak my rhymes in English not breaking no magnatics 
 Cause that's for other people who ain't got em 
 But if almost every other rhyme I can spot em 
 Get off it get off the band wagon 
 Runnin' the same old style that keeps dragging 
 Everlast is all with rhymes ready to drop 
 Here yo here I go again 
 I'm the foreman of this rap this rhyme style destruction 
 Your on the eve of destruction 
 (Wait a minute) 
 Keep on singing, keep on singing, keep on singing, keep on singing 
 Keep on singing, keep on singing, keep on singing, keep on singing 
 Step forward baser meet the grim reaper 
 Your aiming for the top as the ladder gets steeper 
 To my man Divine I send this dedication 
 To let him know that with his help I got a syndication 
 With the dope rhymes I write the styles of the sight 
 Don't follow this leader I'm not your god light 
 To the groove I'm smooth like a hit from a hooter 
 I might smoke the herb but I won't sniff a shooter 
 Not hanging with gangs or messin with thugs 
 Not taking no cane nore deal in no drugs 
 'Cause I'm straight like an arrow the panther bottle was narrow 
 On the rhymes everlast is sore like a sparrow 
 Through the sky so don't ask me why 
 If your dazed and confused you must be high 
 So before you try and break make sure that your sober 
 'Cause I'll snatch a crown boy then I'll just roll yer 
 (Wait a minute) 
 Keep on singing, keep on singing, keep on singing, keep on singing 
 Keep on singing, keep on singing, keep on singing, keep on singing 
 Here yo come here lend me a ear 
 Everlast is the name for me and my gear 
 So get up get with it come on admit it 
 The rhyme I just spoke, you wish you did it like I do 
 And you try to, but I will quit while I'm ahead if I were you 
 But I'm not I give it all I got get the girls on the floor 
 Make 'em hot to drop, it's a caucassion sensation 
 There's no hesitation 
 Everlast reigns supreme an I'm a syndication 
 Keep on keep on keep on singin' 
 Keep on keep on keep on singin' 
 Keep on keep on keep on singin' 
 Keep on singin' keep on singin' 
 Everlast dope
