We're all gonna die 
 We're all gonna die 
 When I was a very young boy 
 Mama told me we're all gonna die 
 Mama said, "Son, love can't be trusted. 
 It's just another weakness. We're all gonna die." 
 Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie 
 We're all gonna die 
 Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie 
 We're all gonna die 
 Now I'm grown, seen a lot livin' 
 Made a few friends, gonna get high 
 Hoping I don't take more than I'm given 
 Judgement day comin', we all gonna die 
 If my wings should fail me, Lord 
 Meet me with another pair 
 Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie 
 We're all gonna die 
 Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie 
 We're all gonna die 
 Baby getting born, old man dyin' 
 Young lady laughn', old woman cryin' 
 Leaving like a lamb, comin' back like a lion 
 Babylon to Zion, we're all gonna die 
 Praise the most high, we're all gonna die 
 When I was a very young boy 
 Mama told me, "We're all gonna die." 
 Mama said, "Son, love can't be trusted. 
 It's just another weakness. We're all gonna die." 
 Praise the most high, we're all gonna die 
 If my wings should fail me, Lord 
 Meet me with another pair 
 Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie 
 We're all gonna die 
 Baby don't cry, praise the most high, We're all gonna die 
 We're all gonna die 
 Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie 
 We're all gonna die 
 Baby don't cry, praise the most high, We're all gonna die 
 We're all gonna die
