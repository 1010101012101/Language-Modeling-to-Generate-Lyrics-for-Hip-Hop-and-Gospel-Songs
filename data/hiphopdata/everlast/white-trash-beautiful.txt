White Trash Beautiful, Trailor Park Queen 
 She slings hash at the diner from eleven to five 
 She married a boy from school 
 Thought he was oh so cool, but all he can do for money is drive 
 Out late haulin' freight on Interstate Five 
 Prayin' he'll see home before his baby arrive 
 White Trash Beautiful 
 There's something you should know 
 My heart belongs to you 
 I know you coulda found a better guy 
 I'll love you till the day I die 
 I swear to God it's true 
 I'm comin' home to you 
 I'm comin' home to you girl 
 He lights a cigarette, his eyes half open 
 He won't be home tonight, but she keeps hopin' 
 Drinkin' himself to sleep is his only way of copein' 
 She waits for him every night, she leaves the front door open 
 It's four AM I'm doin' 95, tryin' to stay awake and make it home alive 
 White Trash Beautiful 
 There's something you should know 
 My heart belongs to you 
 I know you coulda found a better guy 
 I'll love you till the day I die 
 I swear to God it's true 
 I'm comin' home to you 
 I'm comin' home to you girl 
 Her lip stick's painted red, her nametag's crooked 
 Her heart's been gone awhile with the truck driving man that took it 
 He keeps her photograph on his rearview mirror 
 She prays for him every night, she hopes that he can hear her
