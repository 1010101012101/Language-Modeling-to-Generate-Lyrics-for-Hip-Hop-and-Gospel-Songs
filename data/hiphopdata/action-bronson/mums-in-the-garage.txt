I want the yen in the envelope, cookies from the girl scout 
 Them is whipped, spread wings, bring them furs out 
 Chew my food, spit it out into a bird's mouth 
 It's only one and I'm already on the 3rd house 
 Baby seizing upper side 'cause I don't wanna make it hot 
 'Cause if they pull me over, doggie, then I'm splitting like a fox 
 Into the forest, hide behind the trees, lit the orange 
 I got your honor under the armpit, I take the charges 
 Red roses, lay in wood boxes often 
 Park the ten porches outside the good doctor's office 
 Turn my head, cough 'cause I'm smoking on a dead corpse 
 Leave you sleeping next to a head horse 
 Spark the rose mary, I saw the pussy and it's so heavy 
 Take the leather out the closet like a known fairy 
 I fuck it but I won't marry 
 They catch me all over the map, getting throwed deadly 
 Yo, straight out the garage, al bundy with no horse or carriage 
 Straight out the paratroopers parachuting over paris 
 Straight out the charismatic, charisma 
 I call that vision, been ridden by a thick one, divorce and marriage 
 Beautiful view from out the terrace 
 While I was out recruiting the crew, another tail from the careless 
 Side of pocket, caught her staring, then knocked it out the park 
 Roger merris, I shoot the fair warn, I shoot the sheriff 
 Not a dollar more and not a dollar less 
 Fucking any day or time of night 
 Call her up, call me jimmi walker dynamite 
 The city stalker with a violent life, silent knife 
 Uptown of scaper, this ain't harlem, this is solemn nights 
 A little crazy, he became a nuisance 
 Making moves up out the west and got it off without a blueprint 
 The money talking shit, keep it stirring 
 I'm 20-20 from my past life and live it reoccurring 
 Mad man, I rip up stages 
 Specialized in removing lips from faces 
 Type of animal only exist in cages 
 Boy, I traveled over seven seas to distant places 
 To retrieve exotic pets, karate chop the nipple of your chest 
 Ring the alarm, this is not a test 
 Kashmir sweaters made for golfing 
 Looting a coffin, high enough to communicate with a dolphin 
 Moron olympics, toss midgets like a discus 
 Sweat some stitch but ralph lipchitz 
 Spiff lit, instantly I cook like this quick 
 Pump room rocking, I'm a bad brain misfit 
 Laughing while I'm dipping dash and glock weapons 
 Big bully, foot grass, snuck on rap, I'm hot stepping with aggression 
 The minute that you drifting is direction 
 Bubble like indigestion on a rhythm section 
 Stealing the coffin, mums in the garage
