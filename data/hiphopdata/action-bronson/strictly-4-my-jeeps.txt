Better slow down baby! I'm out here wildin 
 Uh! Better slow down baby! Shit is crazy! 
 You need to slow down baby 
 My whole team cash and load out baby 
 I'm a hero in my hometown baby 
 Stop talkin' just go down baby 
 (Verse One) 
 Shit on my chest shoot colors like a Care Bear 
 All year see me tan hopin out the van 
 You wasn't there, now you tryin' to show face 
 Fuck around be a cold case 
 Chrome skates on a old date, remote control chains 
 Promote dough for the veins 
 Poke chicks, hoes with vogue legs, eat steak off of gold plates 
 Stoned listenin to Coldplay 
 Shit! You need to slow down baby 
 My whole team cash and load out baby 
 I'm a hero in my hometown baby 
 Stop talkin' just go down baby 
 (Verse Two) 
 Lil' knife by the spinal built like a rhino 
 Push the six thirty five to the finals 
 Pearl white like what you sniffin in your sinus 
 The finest vaginas demolished by my dick 
 One year, from Queens to the top 
 Cream of the crops serve a fiend out my sock 
 Five minutes till they lean like the drop 
 Now they spinnin through the furnace like a scene from The Rock 
 Hide spinach like a doomsday prepper 
 Every Sunday in my Tuesday leather 
 Now my beard look like Uday and Qusay 
 Play the pool on a cool day 
 Shit! You need to slow down baby 
 My whole team cash and load out baby 
 I'm a hero in my hometown baby 
 Stop talkin' just go down baby 
 (Verse Three) 
 Alot of people with there hands out now 
 Got these motherfuckers mad 'cause I'm a stand out now 
 You never let the hammer off you got the soft hands 
 I heard you singin' for the bossman 
 Dude! I'm from a lost land, spill coke on the heater 
 Drop a little sauce from the beater 
 Zero to sixty in a porche like a cheetah 
 New York I'm like Jeter, light ceaser 
 No hype beast the, rock a nice sneaker 
 You get dressed for the good price my price cheaper 
 Guaranteed, my trunk slappin like a tambourine 
 Bodyin these pussies with a camera team 
 Uh! You better slow down baby! Uh! You better slow down baby! 
 Uh! You better slow down baby! Better slow down baby! 
 You need to slow down baby 
 My whole team cash and load out baby 
 I'm a hero in my hometown baby 
 Stop talkin' just go down baby 
 You need to slow down baby 
 (You know what time it is man? Ain't no love here!) 
 I'm a hero in my hometown baby 
 (Take you back to 5th grade, punch you in your face on picture day!) 
 You need to slow down baby 
 (Fifty dominicans deep! No socks on!) 
 I'm a hero in my hometown baby 
 (Awww man look who just fuckin' pulled up! It's me!
