[Intro: Action Bronson] (Harry Fraud Sample) 
 Bam Bam! (La muscia de Harry Fraud!) 
 (Chorus: Action Bronson) 
 Uh! White leather to the knee we in the tropics 
 Left hand is switchin speeds I'm in the cockpit 
 Straight from Flushing man we known for usin' chopsticks 
 Problems gettin' dealt with never pop shit 
 Hit you with the drop kick Marty Jannetty 
 Know I hit you with that drop kick Marty Jannetty 
 Know I hit you with that drop kick Marty Jannetty 
 Know I hit you with that drop kick Marty Jannetty 
 (Verse One: Action Bronson) 
 Rock this Shawn Kemp kamikaze 
 Burnin cheese, saganaki (Opa!) 
 Greek shit, whole team sick 
 Hold bitches from Cleveland on my dick 
 Because I rap (Rap!) Fuck it make it clap 
 Throw the money in the air then pick it up I'll take that back bitch! 
 Homey hold me down homey throw me phony pounds 
 The scent of dollars like some crispy garlic golden brown 
 Addicted, but ain't nothin' prescripted 
 Baby clams from Montauk mix it up with the linguistics 
 Bitch I'm high 
 (Chorus: Action Bronson) 
 White leather to the knee we in the tropics 
 Left hand is switchin speeds I'm in the cockpit 
 Straight from Flushing man we known for usin' chopsticks 
 Problems gettin' dealt with never pop shit 
 Hit you with the drop kick Marty Jannetty 
 Know I hit you with that drop kick Marty Jannetty 
 Know I hit you with that drop kick Marty Jannetty 
 Know I hit you with that drop kick Marty Jannetty 
 (Verse Two: Wiz Khalifa) 
 Uh! Know I hit you with that hot shit 
 Straight up off the block, roll up pot shit 
 Niggas just don't wanna go to school 
 Act like they are but they not sick 
 Money all up in my pocket, puttin' diamonds in everything 
 See me out I look rich as fuck, clothes smellin like Mary Jane 
 Ride coastal been on every plane 
 Say these guys close but these guys loco 
 When they see me they non-vocal 
 High as fuck I need bifocals (Bifocals) 
 Kush got me movin slow mo (Slow mo) 
 Steaks and eggs in my dojo (Dojo) 
 It's some g's in there need some weed I'm there 
 All these cars I own ain't no keys in there (Ain't no keys in there) 
 Tappin young niggas out (Niggas out) Rollin' weed at a ounce (At a ounce) 
 Now I gotta bigger crib (Bigger crib) Reppin what I live about (Live about) 
 My hair long my weed strong so they starin' (So they starin') 
 My weed strong my money long I ain't carin (I ain't carin) 
 (Chorus: Action Bronson) 
 White leather to the knee we in the tropics 
 Left hand is switchin speeds I'm in the cockpit 
 Straight from Flushing man we known for usin' chopsticks 
 Problems gettin' dealt with never pop shit 
 Hit you with the drop kick Marty Jannetty 
 Know I hit you with that drop kick Marty Jannetty 
 Know I hit you with that drop kick Marty Jannetty 
 Know I hit you with that drop kick Marty Jannetty
