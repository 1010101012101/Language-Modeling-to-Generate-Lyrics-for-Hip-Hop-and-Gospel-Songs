Wicked, wicked production you know how it go man 
 Y'all listen to music by Harry Fraud man 
 0'12 man. New 'tings 
 Bronson man 
 Big boss Bronson man and little brother DZA 
 Yo, once again it's the quintessential stud muffin 
 Spanish bitches stub sucking' they wanna have my kid 
 My people know how to bid, I focus on how to live though 
 Come through the window snatch your kiddo while he watchin' Nintendo 
 The people love us though they snub us in the corporate world 
 Fuck it we lawless ridin' filthy in the Taurus with Doris, she 85 
 My neighbour, thrilled by wild behaviour they get a bloomers when I'm in Aruba with a scuba jet 
 Yes, kush god daddy I'm on that other flow 
 That motherfuck that cover tho that hustle move a mother load 
 That, big boy talk say raps you tryna book a show, gold bottle 
 Hold the rows kush rolled that's holy smoke 
 It's turnbuckle music, straight off the third row 
 Straight on you herbs throats, that's why you birds broke 
 Tweet tweetin' with your tweetin' ass, we rather count cash and chew some hash 
 We bout that 
 (You pick him up), I drop 'em 
 (He tryna creep), I watch him 
 (You need me tag me in), Nah don't worry I got it 
 Should never fuck around with people that's a stable 
 (Cut into your navel), Put 'em through the table. 
 Brushing Paris Holland Italy Pristina 
 Kosovo, Denmark, hopping out the bed sharp 
 I teach you how to live 
 Michael 'caine dirty rotten scoundrels 
 My bitches blow me at the opera while I'm rocking sandals 
 Light linen, rest on my physique 
 I'm testin', built for the west 
 And you get molested while you sleep 
 Back to the essence cause your testicles are weak 
 Got some Mexicans to put the fucking hash between there cheeks
