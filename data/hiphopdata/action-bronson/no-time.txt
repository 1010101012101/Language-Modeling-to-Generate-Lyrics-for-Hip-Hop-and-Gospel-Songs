It's always me! Yeah! Uh! Yeah! Beautiful! 
 Magnifiq! Straight up! Uh huh! 
 No time for struggle 'cause we shinin today today 
 Look out the window see me flyin away away 
 No time for struggle 'cause we shinin today today 
 Look out the window see me flyin away away 
 It's a proven fact money make the world go 'round 
 And a couple sweet words will make your girl go down 
 On the whole team 'cause you weren't takin' care of business 
 See me in a beamer, see you in a civic (Uh!) 
 No time for struggle 'cause we shinin today today 
 Look out the window see me flyin away away 
 No time for struggle 'cause we shinin today today 
 Look out the window see me flyin away away 
 (Verse One) 
 When I step up in the party yes I'm lettin my nuts hang 
 Tryin' to fuck a groupie bitch right on the hood of the mustang 
 I'm from a place where they bust things, hailin from Flushing 
 Peace to bloodstain, beamer custame 
 On a California king where the thug lay (That's word to me man!) 
 The joint longer than Mutombo finger, my features etch 
 Shorty sniffin lines like a sketch 
 Tell her that I need my slippers fetched 
 I need a wifey tongue longer that cakey 
 Shoot the gun right when I whistle plus she never will snake me 
 Do a split on my dick 
 If I'm sick she'll even clean me if I shit in my pants 
 So I'm takin' her to France with me 
 No time for struggle 'cause we shinin today today 
 Look out the window see me flyin away away 
 No time for struggle 'cause we shinin today today 
 Look out the window see me flyin away away 
 (Verse Two) 
 Doin' math like an asian student 
 I've been a truant, three language fluent 
 Blueish on the buick, reddish on the hue 
 On the cheeks of my booby, her body smokin' like a dooby 
 The joint rolled like a croissant mad butter, golden brown 
 If I end up in the can then who 'gon hold me down? 
 Probably no one, they like you when you hot when you not 
 They tell you eat a cock off the springboard I dive into the drop 
 Gold watch like I just retired 
 No socks in the loafer 'cause it's tacky 
 At least I'm not up in Pataki's, you catch me higher than a Shaq knee 
 See me swervin side to side like Mutombo finger 
 The bundle bringer, guns are subtle 
 Hear 'em clappin like the end of the huddle 
 I might be big as a bear but nothin' to cuddle 
 Hop in the shuttle land in Russia 
 Yo! 
 No time for struggle 'cause we shinin today today 
 Look out the window see me flyin away away 
 No time for struggle 'cause we shinin today today 
 Look out the window see me flyin away away 
 It's a proven fact money make the world go 'round 
 And a couple sweet words will make your girl go down 
 On the whole team 'cause you weren't takin' care of business
