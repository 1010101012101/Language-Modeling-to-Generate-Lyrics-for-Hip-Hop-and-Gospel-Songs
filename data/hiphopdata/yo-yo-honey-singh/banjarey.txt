Ghoome ghoome banjarey 
 Ghoome galiyaan yeh bechare 
 Don't know which way to go 
 Aage hoga kya? 
 Hey... hey... hey... hey... (x4) 
 Bin pooche ghar se bhaage 
 Thode soye thode jaage 
 Baahar hai duniya zaalim 
 Rab hi jaane jo hoga aage (x2) 
 Sach bolo toh munh ki khaate 
 Jhooti duniya jhoote saare 
 Don't know which way to go 
 Aage hoga kya ? 
 Ghoome ghoome banjare 
 Ghoome galiyan yeh bechare 
 Don't know which way to go 
 Aage hoga kya ? 
 Befikre chaar malangi 
 Chhod ke aaye saathi sangi 
 Ghar baithe show-sha mein kharche 
 Ho gayi saali jeb ki tangi (x2) 
 Chalti baazi naach nachaye 
 Ab toh humko Rab hi bachaye 
 Don't know which way to go 
 Aage hoga kya? 
 Ghoome ghoome banjarey 
 Ghoome galiyan yeh bechare 
 Don't know which way to go 
 Aage hoga kya? 
 Hey... hey... hey... hey. 
 Ho gayi jab haalat kadki 
 Yaad aane lagi phir ghar ki 
 Botal ka dhakkan khola 
 Kasar mita di zindagi bhar ki (x2) 
 Ho ruk gaye aansu, ban gaye pathhar 
 Jeena nahi hai ab mar-mar kar 
 Don't know which way to go, aage hoga kya? 
 Ghoome ghoome banjarey 
 Ghoome galliyan yeh bechare 
 Don't know which way to go, aage hoga kya? 
 Ha... it's all about life 
 It's all about fellas in yaari 
 Ha... It's all about mere dost ki gaadi 
 Hey... hey... hey... hey. 
 Friends forever an ever!
