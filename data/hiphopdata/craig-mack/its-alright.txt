It's all right 
 As you may have heard 
 To smoke the fat one and let the thunder burn 
 It's okay, to play this loud 
 Mr DJ, don't mean to sweat you down 
 (Missy) 
 I stuck my fingers in the socket, I blew up like a rocket 
 In the market, now I cannot stop it 
 Oh mommy, oh papi, why they envy me? 
 Messing up my creativity with all this negativity 
 So now I'm drinking gin-and-seng 
 Anything to mess with my concentration with hallucinations 
 Of invasion, from waiting on the nation 
 To get with my style 
 'Cause I'm about to transmit into some funky ish 
 Can you get with this? 
 Zay, villaveu, yes, ugh! 
 They ask me if I'm nasty, they ask me, they bet me too 
 Like osh-kosh-bigosh, osh cock suck their cocks 
 Osh miss Miss iss oh shit 
 I gets mad styles, get it get it 
 I'm wit it wit it if you wit it, oh shit then let's split it 
 Into a 20 sack, and I'ma be back 
 With my boy Craig Mack like that, ugh! 
 (Craig Mack) 
 Don't sweat me down 
 This jam needs a fronting MC, leave MC's shaking in the ground 
 Here come the bumpening sound 
 Worth more than the coke that they selling by the pound 
 I walk the street like Shaft 
 Hop to kick a paragraph, floating on the funk like a life raft 
 Down with Sista, it's the MC brezzle twister 
 Mackalicious boy I'll pop you like a blister 
 Craig Mack's a Jedi Knight with The Force of course 
 I can run MC's through my teeth like dental floss 
 So back up and don't sweat me down 
 Boo docks on locks, fat boys nabbed the home town 
 And you can get the balls like that 
 Hitting wicked like the funkalicious rhymes that's phat, 
 And we can get back in forth off the back 
 (Missy) 
 Oh if, I could bring sucker-suckertash 
 When I farts I poops cash from my ass 
 Cause If You Think You're Lonely Now 
 Like Bobby Womack in gangsta format, I dunk shit like Shaq 
 I'm not greedy, I feeds the needy, I smokes a beady 
 I feel, the need to stroke the weedy 
 Oh big daddy, is you ready *slurp* 
 To slurp me in your mouth like spaghetti? 
 Hi Ho Silver, ya killer, my drug dealer 
 For reala, I drinks some Miller, ugh 
 Look up in the sky 
 It's a birdie, yes I'm worthy for certy 
 Black eyed peas, all in my butt like fleas 
 Oh we's smell panties 
 All in my crack 
 My amplifier's on the maxi light, Kotter Welcome Back
