 Birds eye view I'm looking down at the lil dudes 
 And if I had to pussy nigga, I'll rob you 
 You wanna see me locked 24 just like cops do 
 You hatin from the sidelines that's what's your job to (do)

 Just like my shows do my main bitch rolling for me

 Even though the radio refuse to give us airplay 
 Bump this shit in yah Cadillac yo Cutlass or box Chevy 
 Heavy Timothy mcveigh knock it down like OKC boi and 
 It ain't no nigga on yah playlist fucking with an a-list 
 Nigga like B-l-G B-O-l boi effortlessly fly. I tend to over think 
 When I ink these bars 
 But yall niggas don't even try 
 Ball till yah fall or your homies die 
 Pour out a little liquor let one in the sky 
 Don't cry let that doves do that 
 When the guns go blaat 
 Now that's what we call the pop life true that 
 "They wanna know what's going on in the south" 
 A nigga kicked back at the house with my flip flops 
 On got an ounce on the couch 
 Blow a bag, crack a jar open, we all smoking and
