Whoa 
 Another day 
 I take your pain away 
 Some people talk about ya 
 Like they know all about ya 
 When you get down they doubt ya 
 And when you dip it on the scene 
 Yeah they talkin' 'bout it 
 'Cause they can't dip on the scene 
 Whatcha talk about it 
 T-t-t-talkin' 'bout it 
 When you get elevated, 
 They love it or they hate it 
 You dance up on them haters 
 Keep getting funky on the scene 
 One, two, three, ho 
 While it jumps round yao 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Now shut up, yeah 
 Yeah, now put some voodoo on it 
 Ladies and gentlemen the funkiest 
 Horn section in Metropolis 
 Yeah, oh 
 We call that Classy Brass 
 Oh 
 Oh 
 Do you mind? 
 If I play the ukulele 
 Just like a little lady 
 Do you mind? 
 If I play the ukulele 
 Just like a little lady 
 As I play the ukulele 
 If I play my ukulele 
 Just like a little lady 
 (Happy birthday)
