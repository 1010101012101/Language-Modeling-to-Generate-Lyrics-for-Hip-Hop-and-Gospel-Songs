When I seen her walking down the street she was pretty thick 
 Did you get her name? Did you get her number? 
 You see, baby had back, I ain't really into skinny chicks 
 And she tastes like raspberries, damn, I want you to know 
 And if you see how she work the stroll 
 That body was out of control 
 Ain't no way I was about to let her go 
 I ran my game like I was supposed 
 We be rhyming on the beat, but the beats so cold 
 We be rhyming on the beat, but the beats so cold 
 We be rhyming on the beat, but the beats so cold 
 We be rhyming on the beat, but the beats so cold 
 If her boyfriend trying to trip talking shit, I'mma beat his ass 
 You should let her go, it ain't worth the problems, hell no 
 If she come right now she'd be down, but I don't love here though 
 Plus she tastes like raspberries, man, I thought you should know 
 And if you see how she work the stroll 
 That body was out of control 
 Ain't no way I was about to let her go 
 I ran my game like I was supposed 
 When I seen her walking down the street she was pretty thick 
 Can't remember name, but I got her number
