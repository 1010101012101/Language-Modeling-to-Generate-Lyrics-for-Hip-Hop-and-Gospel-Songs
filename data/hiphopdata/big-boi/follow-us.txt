With one stroke of the pen 
 I tune in to your satell ite radio or fm stat ion 
 I've been pat iently wa iting to weigh in 
 Been under construction for two years 
 But now it's about that time I double dutch my way in 
 Leftfoot, rightfoot steppin over biters 
 It's like the game is haunted cause there's so many ghost writers 
 Me see I'm a lifer with supply that may seem endless 
 Straight rider like a biker on a chopper with a hitlist 
 Witness the ni**a that spit that vicious 
 Pitbull atta ck shit when it comes to this rap shit 
 Daddy fat sax bitch 
 Follow us now 
 Try to all the way now 
 It's not another let down 
 Got something to say right now... 
 (Repeat hook) 
 I know some of y'all done wrote a ni**a off 
 Like the leases on these cars 
 And these homes you ni**as thought you staye d in 
 With so many bosses why are they still 
 Lay ing ni**as off they job, ni**a for real 
 Gone give a ni**a a gig then 
 Help a brother get up out this pig pen 
 But nobody want s to keep it pimpin' 
 Or 110 / so with this pen 
 I begin to illustrate from within, boy 
 Pa int a pretty picture like I'm chilling with my friends 
 Every body's got a pocket full of ends to spend 
 See picasso couldn't blend 
 Put it all together or fit in 
 I'm like a crocodile wal kin' 'round with alligator skin 
 Yes I'm is the product of the ghetto where I've lived 
 Call me sponge bob, boy 
 Soaked up game as a little bitty kid 
 And never been a lame before the fame I wa s the shit 
 And now I'm just big ya dig. 
 Follow us now 
 Try to all the way now 
 It's not another let down 
 Got something to say right now... 
 (Repeat hook)

 We gone la-la lay it down every fucking time we see 'em 
 Make the club get crunk. yup

 But wa it, it's not a sequel 
 No wa it, it's bb's prequel 
 The beginning before the beginning 
 Spend it how you spend it 
 Then if you sell dope ni**a sta ck it when you get it

 Or spend it until it's gone 
 That 's slippery business homes 
 Go get you a business loans
