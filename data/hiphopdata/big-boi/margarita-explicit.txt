5 o'clock 
 But I stopped @ 4:59 
 Twist a jay of some hay 
 Got a call from sleepy brown (brown) 
 Say it's going down (down) 
 Town, at the lounge 
 Defintley crowed with the happy hour crowd 
 Drinks for a dollar 
 Everybody's buzzin, cuzzin 
 Spittin' like a major leauge pitcher 
 Tryna cut somethang 
 Only throwin' balls no strikes for tonight 
 So walk up to tha chevy for some heavy thinkin' 
 Lets ride 
 To my underground bungalow 
 Uproach the mounds 
 Baby I'm tha head coach now 
 Wow! baby need a wet cold towel 
 Pharrel's on tha way so stay and play awhile
