 That's why every dime is making money 
 Got it down to a science yeah she study 
 Since the beginning of time

 She say she wanna see me 
 But I got me somebody 
 I tell her see you next lifetime 
 But she want d today 
 And if I give her d 
 Then she will never go away 
 We went from a watching a lil movie 
 To me drilling for babies 
 Now she know that I know 
 That we know we fucking 
 All up on each other 
 Lino cuffing 
 Just bussing 
 Don't stop till 
 You get enough 
 Of the hip thrusting 
 Trust me always 
 In a must win 
 Fall back 
 When she thinking 
 I'm her husband, boyfriend, bae 
 Nawl give up the drawls 
 Forever in the friend zone 
 Yes we are 
 I know it may seem 
 I'm falling for her plans 
 I know it may seem 
 She's got me eating out her hands 
 She's not my lady 
 And I am not her man 
 See that's just my friend 
 And we gone let you do the math

 Round after round while pipe touch spine 
 Mine is the kind when you just touch down 
 You had a long flight but you wanna buss now 
 Or later like the candy come out them panties please 
 Gotta be polite with all these freaks, freeze tag the moon 
 Over the stars into the boomiverse we are
