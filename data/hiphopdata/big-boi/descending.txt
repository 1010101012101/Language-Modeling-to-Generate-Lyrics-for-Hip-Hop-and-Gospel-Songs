Jag k√§nner att jag faller 
 If ya don't know me by now 
 If ya don't know me by now 
 If ya don't know me by now 
 If ya don't know me by now 
 You will never know 
 If ya don't, if ya don't 
 When I think back, I'm glad I lived it all 
 The pain when I'm thinking about it, dad 
 I will not fall, even tired and all 
 Grand-mamas, great grand-mama they gone 
 My daddy's gone 
 If ya don't know me by now 
 If ya don't know me by now 
 If ya don't know me by now 
 If ya don't know me by now 
 You will never know 
 If ya don't, if ya don't 
 Hey, even with a storm to face, I still stand tall 
 I take beyond, the city I was born and raised 
 Lights, lights turn off, running along my own way 
 My body lift up, even when I go stray 
 By now you should know us 
 If ya don't know me by now 
 If ya don't know me by now 
 If ya don't know me by now 
 If ya don't know me by now 
 You will never know 
 If ya don't, if ya don't 
 From the bottom of my chest to my stomach 
 Got damn it, my daddy is gone 
 (From the waves that rock I listen for you 
 I'm listening through) 
 If ya don't know me by now 
 If ya don't know me by now 
 If ya don't know me by now 
 If ya don't know me by now 
 You will never know 
 If ya don't, if ya don't
