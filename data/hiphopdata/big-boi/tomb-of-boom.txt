Speakerboxxx 
 Yo, just so you all know what time it is 
 It's your homeboy straight from the A T 
 I ain't even goin' say the motherfucking rest 
 But you know, we talked about it all day long, baby 
 We fin'a break you off with some brand new shit 
 Yo, yo, yo, yo, this rap game lovely 
 Konkrete play a part 'cause the Feds want to bug me 
 Athletes want to be rappers, shawty, trust me 
 Bending corners in the Benz, ridin' like a bucket, nigga, fuck it 
 I know some hoes slutty 
 I optioned a bitch off like a nigga playin' rugby 
 I done seen a ghetto meal, little buddy, trust me 
 Jump European, came clean through customs, no questions 
 Perpetrators in the booth, rappin' lame like they drug related 
 It made me sick to my stomach, lost a two and had a baby 
 You don't grind, you be lying 
 She'll be castrated, Lorena Bobitt maybe 
 Tomb after tomb, boom, boom after boom 
 Serving up emotion once you deep inside that tomb 
 Embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb 
 Cool, ooh that's cool 
 You see, I cock back glocks, got more pull than slang shots 
 Hit G spots, I'm givin' hoes back shots 
 I'm a young country boy, long socks with flip flops 
 But I pull up on your block in the 500 Benz drop 
 Konkrete, Aquemini, we takin' this here to the top 
 Bust like balloons, who gives a damn if it goes pop? 
 You say it's hot, well, let me turn it up another notch 
 To all my real niggaz, won't you pump this out your Speakerboxxx? 
 Fuck the cops, we makin' noise and we won't stop 
 Bump, bump, there goes the boom and it's goin' drop 
 Old school, big shoes, nigga, no socks 
 We keep tools, see fools, bullets will flock 
 They call me Mr. Ravioli, Mr. Scrotum 
 Mr. Poke Em with the Noodle 
 Mr. Cockerspanielle in your Poodle, after school tutor 
 Roto Rooter, addicted to follies 
 Like brown collies, stay soft fro crows 
 Swimming in the fallopian of an Ethiopian 
 Talking a different language, RBI fly wide 
 Come to me now, 84 hard, 84 soft wit me now 
 Beautiful ladies, they want to walk wit me now, talk wit me now 
 Push a glock for me now, sale cock for me now 
 Fight a bitch, hit her in the eye for me now 
 See you when I see you, now out wit me now 
 Tomb after tomb, boom, boom after boom 
 Serving up emotion once you deep inside that tomb 
 Embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb 
 Cool, ooh that's cool 
 I will never fall off, I haul off heavy weight 
 Fuck wit me, dog, I chop you up like Norman Bates 
 I'm true to this shit, I ain't new to this shit 
 Over a million sold on strictly weed and bricks 
 Flammable like gasoline when I'm lit up 
 I prefer my liquor dark and a mean white slut 
 It's over for you, cavern ass rappers, get out the game 
 You can fool the record labels but not the street fame 
 I just tell it how I see it, nigga, fact is fact 
 The first verse I ever wrote, I got a Platinum plaque 
 I've been to hell and back so nigga give me my props 
 Konkrete, Big Boi beatin' through your Speakerboxxx, yeah 
 Tomb after tomb, boom, boom after boom 
 Serving up emotion once you deep inside that tomb 
 Embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb 
 Cool, ooh that's cool 
 Ludacris, yeah, I keep a glock in case you like to leak a lot 
 Meanwhile, crankin' the volume knob up on my Speakerboxxx 
 So here we at, get the fuck on the ground 
 It's just a phase you might hear strolling through the A Town 
 They don't believe, I will stab them in the abdomen 
 From College Park, Georgia to College Park, Maryland 
 So put your fist up, boy, you wanna romp 
 You can Bankhead Bounce or get Eastside Stomped 
 Thinking way back before I got mine 
 Putting bullet holes through the neighborhood stop signs 
 [Incomprehensible] it's my adrenaline, yes, ladies and gentleman 
 A hundred though, bitch, diamonds shimmerin' 
 Catch me with a sack of dro, reaching for the strap below 
 I'm with some nasty hoes, eating pistachios 
 Y'all driving Subarus, stuck in your cubicles 
 I'm stuck in the air with weed crumbs under my cuticles 
 Tomb after tomb, boom, boom after boom 
 Serving up emotion once you deep inside that tomb 
 Embryo to newborn, you can feel me in the womb 
 Cool, ooh that's cool 
 Fourth and goal should I take the three point field goal 
 For the score or should I roll? 
 Around and take the ball up the middle up the gut, the what, the hole 
 Cranium overload, over throwed 
 Now we got seven more points on the board, fa sho 
 B I G B O I, me oh my, I think he's blessing me 
 Excelling in harmonious melody, boy, we got the recipe 
 Like Ragu, it's in there, giving you some of the best of me 
 Player, pimp, gangster, poet 
 We goin' spit it, we goin' show it to your ass 
 'You're a champion', were my dad's last words before he passed 
 But I know one day we will once more cross paths 
 They say, "Big Boi, can you pull it off without your nigga Dre" 
 I say, "people, stop the madness 'cause me and Dre be okay" 
 OutKast, Cell Therapy to cell division 
 We just split it down the middle 
 So you can see both the visions 
 Been spittin' it damn near ten years 
 Why the fuck would be be quittin'? 
 Fuck, nigga
