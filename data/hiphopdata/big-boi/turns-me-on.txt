Niggas don't fuck with a nigga like me 
 Cause a nigga like me don't fuck around 
 Niggas don't fuck with a nigga like me 
 Cause a nigga like me don't fuck around 
 Rump bump-it, (repeat 14) 
 I know you see that 
 No one's competing 
 Ooh that turns me on 
 Ooh that turns me on 
 What turns me on about ya, I doubt you have a clue, 
 Sassy attitude, and red bottom shoes 
 Got I'm mad at you 
 I do think you're fierce and that you 
 Killing them of course 
 With the features of an angel 
 And the bottom of a horse 
 Thoroughbred, thorough head 
 Makes ya moist like the dark fudge 
 Brownie with the nut of your choice 
 Soaking wet, all the feathers in the goose 
 Down, who's loose now 
 You done let the juice ooze down 
 Do smile, when you do it's on some ooh child 
 Kiss ya in the mouth, juicy fruit, make it cool down 
 And make it truth, ain't it true now 
 Divine neck, the respect it ain't shit for me to prove gal 
 You need some time, press the snooze down 
 I don't mind 'cause I'm as hard as all the iron in all the tool house 
 Or tool shed, go and play it like 
 When alarm sound off around two is up ahead 
 I know you see that (It ain't going down without cha) 
 No one's competed 
 Ooh that turns me on 
 Ooh that turns me on 
 Who gives a damn about the past 
 I live for the day, plan for the future, pack a lunch, and haul ass 
 Anyway, it ain't no time for no picnics, 
 This that business, the slickness to get your chick hit quick 
 I make her drip all her liquids 
 Then get butt booty naked when I spit on some pimp shit 
 Make her legs shake so she never loses interest 
 Calling out my name when I'm asking, "whose is this? " 
 Naw, it's not a game, ass falling out the frame 
 With the Polaroid camera I have to take two flicks 
 She can't avoid all the stamina, we do this 
 With no steroids or other artificial juices. 
 Therefore, she knows the undisputed truth 
 When I slip into this boo while I slide into this booth 
 I'm kicking it with you, lot like martial artists do 
 We can break boards, and you can kick rocks 
 I know you see that (it ain't going down without cha) 
 No one's competed 
 Ooh that turns me on 
 Ooh that turns me on 
 Sit yourself down on my big old bed 
 Turn your body round here let me give you some- 
 Don't you want to make a freaky memory with me 
 So later on you can think about it then you'll be like 
 Damn... 
 That turns me on 
 I know you see that (It ain't going down without 'cha) 
 No one's competed 
 Ooh that turns me on 
 Ooh that turns me on 
 From the back 
 Now from the front
