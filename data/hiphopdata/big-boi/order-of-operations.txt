 They trying get that gold. Portfolio's diverse 
 This type of paper just don't fold or get throwed in 
 The booty club flexing we hootie hootie them hoes 
 And have em glued to the section, ain't nothing new 
 That just us oozing perfection, been stacking and 
 Flipping this paper 
 Like Mary Lou Retton while niggas been stressing 
 About this money I retired

 Buy a bottle of liquor, looking like the lotto my 
 Nigga but we don't flash it
