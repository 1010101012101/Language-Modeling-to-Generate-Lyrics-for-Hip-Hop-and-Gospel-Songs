I think it's time for us to stir the pot 
 Like the feelings in the bitter broad 
 Because she hurt a lot and yes I 
 Been aboard because I work a lot 
 See we done did it all still bussing 
 Like you jerk it out, it's nothing like 
 Riding a huffy or my little brother 
 James out chea slanging them 
 Puppies, slanging superstar dick 
 Till she say that she love me 
 Raps Underground Railroad but 
 Nothings above me, shits lovely 
 We stay blooming like its spring break 
 Flower child Cadillac look like cheese plate 
 Crack a smile like a gator with his mouth close 
 Or crocodiles from the Nile yeah we cop those 
 Calendar booked like library got shows 
 You can ask my nigga Welch these are not jokes 
 Or you can ask me for my help I'll send a life boat 
 Or life raft for yo riff raff ass I keep it classy 
 Like you just got a scholarship, or like a waffle house 
 Waitress with a dollar tip, don't like them see you sweat 
 Fuck all them poli'tricks, better gohe get some gold 
 Fuck that dollar bih, I'll daddy fat on the kill boy 
 Keep the party going never was a killjoy 
 I know you feel boy 
 That's me in third person sometimes I get beside myself 
 I call it soul searching, words and sentences in parenthesis 
 Everything quotable bitch remember this 
 And take these with yah 
 Sack one sack two in yah jaw on your knees with yah 
 Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh 
 We spit universes, birthing worlds with words 
 From darkness came the big boomiverse facts 
 I never met my match but niggas now rather listen 
 To the rumors first, this shits empirical, and still fearing 
 Till the last bitch emcee eliminated uses his dying breath 
 To proclaim he the most lyrical 
 God they done damned up 
 The flow, sammed up the boe came through 
 The door saying 
 This same shit before, fuck nigga bring back hop hip 
 These suckas sound slow but it don't stop shit 
 Damn sure not this 
 What I know so far true fusion only occurs 
 At the heart of a star
