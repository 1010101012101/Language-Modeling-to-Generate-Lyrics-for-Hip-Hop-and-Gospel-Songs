Follow me into a land where impalas squat 
 Young niggas wit hammers and daily bodies drop 
 OG (you) survived you still alive a lot of niggas not 
 Smokin for my dead homies while I ride around 
 Smokin for my dead homies while I ride around 
 Mannie Fresh on the beat he put that wobble on it 
 He blessed the nigga the B-l-G now watch me 
 Gobble homie 
 I put the bottle down hit the throttle got em now Sodom and Gomorrah deplorable's all around my style 
 I'm like the bandage on mummy I got that wrap around 
 Circles on you Urkel ass niggas who tryna 
 Snatch the sound 
 Asinine like my public company tryna cash me out 
 Catch me outside and we can see what 
 All that yapping bout 
 Gladiators with radiators that run hot 
 Impalas with draulics parked at the gun spot 
 My uncle told me don't pull it unless you pop pop 
 (Gun SFX) 
 Mop top head ass nigga you get yo knocked rocked 
 I'm from Atlanta by way of Savannah Georgia 
 Got Louisiana Geechee's who's manners are out of order 
 Be easy when you see me salute me and keep it bailer 
 Only tigers comes with stripes I piped it up for 
 Every bar of em 
 Follow me into a land where impalas squat 
 Young niggas wit hammers and daily bodies drop 
 OG (you) survived you still alive a lot of niggas not 
 Smokin for my dead homies while I ride around 
 Smokin for my dead homies while I ride around 
 Got this Monte Carlo that my older homie sold me 
 Had for some years now to me it's like a trophy 
 My windows up I got my main thang rollin 
 I trust her so I know she gone do it just how I showed her 
 I'm only high when I'm really in the act of smoking 
 But once the joint done homie I'm back at square one 
 Double up something convertibles a make a bitch 
 Wanna fuck something 
 And I done turned corners in a couple of em 
 Fuck on em, stunt on em then I'm duckin em 
 Back in studio hustling bitch we cook drugs in here 
 You was living under false impressions 
 You not really a G dawg you got false credit 
 Follow me into a land where impalas squat 
 Young niggas wit hammers and daily bodies drop 
 OG (you) survived you still alive a lot of niggas not 
 Smokin for my dead homies while I ride around 
 Smokin for my dead homies while I ride around 
 Say we can do what millionaires can can can 
 The green dickie suit is garbage can grand man 
 And what we smoking come from Oakland via San Fran 
 Pound of pressure purchased no flexin no grand stand 
 Country boy proud mane smoking loud mane 
 Blowing purp in the Firebird (car sound) pipes loud mane 
 You hear a skrrrrtttt then you hear brrrrtttt hit 
 The ground mane 
 Them niggas buckin, out of bucket, them niggas bussin 
 Over bitches, dirty bitches, flirty bitches 
 What's this I witnessed, these niggas simpin 
 They once was pimpin 
 Don't even honor, they baby mama, but cake for bitches 
 Aye partna partna! That shit ain't playa stop lookin lame 
 Follow me into a land where impalas squat 
 Young niggas wit hammers and daily bodies drop 
 OG (you) survived you still alive a lot of niggas not
