 Isiah 54:17 
 No weapon formed against me 
 Shall prosper 
 I got a whole team of angels 
 Guarding me from all the danger 
 And keep that 3-5-7 under my seat for all the haters 
 Strapped in One of the last rap niggas snappin 
 Niggas playing sleep I'm Saint Nick 
 With the package 
 Blessed with the gift and only 
 3 stacks can match me 
 Light years ahead of you niggas 
 Another galaxy 
 Boi (I) keep the club packed to capacity 
 Hands in the air bitches make it clap for me 
 Automatically the DJ bring it back for me 
 And drop a bomb on it with the horns (Horn SFX) 
 Globally adored fasho 
 Put Atlanta on the board 
 And now we running up the score

 First thing she say when I fell through 
 A little bit of talk but I walks with a clear view 
 Dynamic, organic 
 Iceberg slim selling trim on the titanic 
 Underwater with it, let me show you how do it to the fullest 
 I'm the hardest, I'm the realest, I'm the dopest

 While I'm doing while I'm doing

 Long beach nigga wit dat eastside flow 
 Dipped in the sauce 
 Imp (P) wit the limp I'm a pimp and a boss

 Keep a blue flag to the left of me 
 And shoot my shit with trajectory 
 Big money, big cars, big toys making big noise

 I'm true to it 
 Had a yellow Cadillac 
 And sold my blue Buick 
 Spent a lot of money 
 But I never blow through it 
 Never blew through it 
 The only thing I blow through 
 Is pussy 
 I'm never pushy in my youth I used to like it but I don't 
 "I loved it" like that because I'm married 
 And I won't "to do nothing" 
 Split that pie up 
 No more it's gone 
 Since thanksgiving 
 I split it four ways its wrong wrong 
 All for my kids and family 
 First generation Patton clan 
 Bitch get at me 
 I's the pappy 
 The papi and the father 
 The only mauri I rock wit are gators or harder 
 Or big block crocs 
 I'm sharper than your sharper image 
 In yah catalog nigga eat yah spinach 
 Or your leafy greens 
 On B B's team 
 We don't see no seeds 
 Straight buds like a rose 
 Now it's a few rules to the game 
 If you really wanna play
