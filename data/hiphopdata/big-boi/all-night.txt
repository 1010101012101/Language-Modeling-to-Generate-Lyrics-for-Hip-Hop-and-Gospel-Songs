If it's alright 
 I wanna kick it 
 With you all night, all night 
 Have a good time 
 Ain't gotta worry 
 'Cause it's alright, it's alright 
 All night 
 All night 
 All night baby 
 Don't be shy 
 Don't be shy 
 Don't be shy baby 
 All night 
 And all night 
 Ain't gotta worry 
 'Cause it's alright, it's alright 
 It's ight 
 It's ok 
 Everybody gone say 
 What they wanna say 
 Player's gone play 
 When they wanna play 
 Lonely 
 Only for one night 
 Like Luther Vandross 
 Right! 
 No way 
 Daddy Fat Saxxx 
 Don't skip no days 
 Either 
 Meet her 
 Greet her 
 Treat her 
 Like a queen 
 Then I give her 
 That peter 
 Jack! 
 That's how we procreate 
 Take care my babies 
 I'm gone tote the weight 
 Imma carry the load 
 And imma win the bread 
 As well! 
 No tricking off 
 With my girl 
 Yo chick 
 In all of my girl 
 She thick 
 With all of her curves 
 Plus she gotta mind on her 
 Street smart 
 Book smart 
 Built by design for me 
 Gotta hold her up 
 'Cause she always holding me down 
 Like a bank robber with a note 
 Give it to the teller 
 So she know we ain't fucking around 
 It's something bout that company 
 I send for you 
 If you come for me, cum for me 
 If it's alright 
 I wanna kick it 
 With you all night, all night 
 Have a good time 
 Ain't gotta worry 
 'Cause it's alright, it's alright 
 All night 
 All night 
 All night baby 
 Don't be shy 
 Don't be shy 
 Don't be shy baby 
 All night 
 And all night 
 Ain't gotta worry 'Cause it's alright, it's alright 
 It's ight 
 It's ok 
 I been feeling good 
 Now a nigga feeling great 
 Started out as a lil hood nigga 
 From savannah 
 Then I moved to the A 
 Dirty Dirty 
 See we grew up 
 On vouges and thirty's 
 Sucking up game like a wet vac 
 Put it out 
 Eat it up 
 Get it right back 
 They ain't worthy 
 Sometimes I think 
 They don't deserve me 
 Big cold as the ice 
 In yah nightcap 
 Hit yah with yah bonnet on 
 By the night lamp 
 We don't discriminate 
 We just want you to participate 
 It takes two to tango 
 Now where the day go 
 This ain't that same old 
 Same old 
 Old same shit 
 We done switch it up 
 Like a plain clothes 
 Five-O 
 Twelve 
 Same code 
 My flow 
 Hell 
 Stay froze 
 It's something bout that company 
 I send for you 
 If you come for me, cum for me 
 If it's alright 
 I wanna kick it 
 With you all night, all night 
 Have a good time 
 Ain't gotta worry 
 'Cause it's alright, it's alright 
 All night 
 All night 
 All night baby 
 Don't be shy 
 Don't be shy 
 Don't be shy baby 
 All night 
 And all night 
 Ain't gotta worry 
 'Cause it's alright, it's alright 
 I just wanna boogie with you, with you 
 Do anything that you wanna do, wanna do 
 Girl I just wanna boogie with you, with you, with you 
 I just wanna boogie with you, with you 
 Do anything that you wanna do, wanna do
