Thom Pettie that ho 
 Thom Pettie that ho 
 Thom Pettie that ho 
 Free falling, Thom Pettie 
 Thom Pettie that ho 
 Thom Pettie that ho 
 Thom Pettie that ho 
 Freefalling, we up all night 
 I brought one chain for medallion 
 With a whole lot of motherfucking diamonds 
 It's astounding like when I be rhyming 
 Always shining like the sun and moon 
 Like a hot air balloon requires fire 
 No methamphetamine, but nigga we get higher 
 Big Boi, dopamine, I mean I'm dope 
 Ain't near when you niggas can't even come close 
 Simple fat sacks 
 Been a serial killer, oh nice to meet you, best believe that 
 Like Ripley's boy, don't tempt me 
 I fuck around and leave your kool-aid glass half empty 
 Your time is running, I'm just like the sand in it 
 Been jammin' in half and half of you niggas know you can't get it 
 That's right, it as in IT 
 We like the apple on your iPhone, niggas always biting 
 Thom Pettie that ho 
 Thom Pettie that ho 
 Thom Pettie that ho 
 Free falling, Thom Pettie 
 Thom Pettie that ho 
 Thom Pettie that ho 
 Thom Pettie that ho 
 Free falling, we up all night 
 We shining like the sun and moon 
 All of your wishes falling through 
 They chasing after you 
 And climbing up the moon 
 We shining like the sun and moon 
 All of your wishes falling through 
 They chasing after you 
 And climbing up the moon 
 (Motel, hotel) 
 Motel, hotel 
 Intercontinental, all cause a nigga push a pencil 
 That's an S550, not a rental 
 Bitch, I don't even ride Lincoln Continentals 
 In the rear seat is a fat black nigga with a smile like Denzel 
 Pretty model bitch with me moving bout as graceful as a gazelle 
 Skinny as a pencil, fold her like a pretzel 
 Hit her with the XL 
 Just in case this funky ass bitch was doing Intel 
 I'mma give her news she can go tell 
 Snitchin' ass bitches get evicted, no bus fare 
 Grown ass women ride a Bentley that's so clear 
 I'm so player, SpottieOttieDopaliscious 
 Mama phony but I swear to God the pussy dope and she delicious 
 One time for my wife and my mistress, gone 
 Thom Pettie that ho 
 Thom Pettie that ho 
 Thom Pettie that ho 
 Free falling, Thom Pettie 
 Thom Pettie that ho 
 Thom Pettie that ho 
 Thom Pettie that ho 
 Free falling, we up all night 
 We shining like the sun and moon 
 All of your wishes falling through 
 They chasing after you 
 And climbing up the moon 
 We shining like the sun and moon 
 All of your wishes falling through 
 They chasing after you 
 And climbing up the moon
