It's not usual, the game be, all up on some South shit 
 Straight west coasting, you can tell by my outfit 
 Red 'nati fitted, "Blood in, Blood out" shit 
 Empty jelly jars, nigga, bird in the couch shit 
 The mad rapper, Oscar the Grouch shit 
 Except when I'm hopping out of cans, I'm pulling out shit 
 Dippin' the four though, double X 3-D Polo 
 If hip-hop was the league, I'd be the motherfuckin' logo 
 Your last shit was so-so, you should sign to Jermaine 
 I've been hard since I was solo 
 Niggas they feel my pain, I make it rain without the strippers 
 Go against the grain, and push your shit back like some clippers 
 I bang and then I hang out at the Staples like Blake Griffin 
 You can tell I'm getting money the way that glass house is sitting 
 I mash out the strip then like Nash when I'm dippin' 
 Feeling like God's son, the way that it was written 
 Them boys want they music on blast 
 Don't turn it down, turn it up every time them cops pass 
 Mashed on the gas, am I getting high, don't even ask 
 'Cause I got another ounce up in the stash 
 Them boys want they music on blast 
 Don't turn it down, turn it up every time them cops pass 
 Mashed on the gas, am I getting high, don't even ask 
 'Cause I take two hits, and then I pass 
 I see the cops in the rear view, 
 Why can't a motherfucker chill in the car 
 Feelin' like Missy, why you all up in my grill 
 They must know that I got bird stashed all up in my grill 
 Camouflage by the armor all while it's sparkling off my wheels 
 And I fuck hoes that prey on Dwight Howard and Shaquille 
 Not them throwback rats they be on showin' on college hill 
 For real, I think my first album sold five mil' 
 And you say to yourself that he is broke 
 Well how the hell am I ballin', like Spalding 
 I did a couple of movies, now agents calling and calling 
 Can't get to the phone right now because my boss is all in this bitch mouth 
 When did we start taking these tricks out? 
 Now she gon' run her big mouth and tell her girlfriend 
 You had her all up in the wind blowing yo cheese on Louie Vuittons 
 And now that bitch is in the wind and after the next draft, 
 She gon' start that cycle again 
 How you claimin' that bitch when she with him, come again 'cause 
 Daddy fat sex, my balls are on your chin, 
 But can you tell me where my dick's at? 
 Gat or ghetto, head hunter, head buster through the chit-chat 
 I skip to the lou, my darling bring the thunder, 
 I'm the lightning that strikes twice 
 Motherfucker, call me master 
 'Cause I run the plantation and I'm whooping niggas asses 
 If they disrespect the presentation, below the Mason-Dixon, 
 We facin' the basses that were missin' pimpin' 
 You can embrace it or come face to face with total devastation 
 My mojo is never fadin', I'm in my Optimus Prime transform 
 Switch it up, heat it up, speed it up, that means I'm gone 
 Light years, ahead of your Buzz, Toy Stories and club songs 
 Black home, the A-T-L-iens are phoning home 
 But I feel like a librarian, 
 'Cause style's are being loaned out like books 
 A castle full of crooks, rape and pillage 
 They'll do anything for money while misleading the village 
 Not from New England, but I pack a patriot 
 Not from Atlanta, but I got the cater 
 Not from Chicago, but I'm a bear 
 I'm a bay area nigga, 49er, Raider 
 I'm about my bread man, I ain't no sucker 
 Now these bitch ass niggas soft as table butter 
 I'm about my riches, magazines, street hustler 
 You can ask your uncles, daddies, mothers, and your older brothers 
 But I used to flee through that yellow white, yo right 
 Sellin' that shit below the retail price 
 I'm a rare breed like the bike club, get it right 
 Desperado like Tori Amos, shout out to dynamite 
 I got my red cup, and some green 
 What kind of green you smoking pimp? Blue dream 
 My nigga let me hit that there hemp, do your thing 
 How many woofers in your trunk? 4 15s
