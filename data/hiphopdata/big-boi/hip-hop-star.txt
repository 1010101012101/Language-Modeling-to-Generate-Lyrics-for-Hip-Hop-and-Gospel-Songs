Pure players 
 Pure players 
 Slowly as Sir Luscious step up like a q-dog 
 A-town's up, deuces down--it's the new call 
 And you can dial 1-888-cut-something 
 I'm your kinky operator when you want to fuck something 
 Ain't no dial tones, just milestones of pleasure to reach 
 To each his own--I'm a stone cold Aquarian freak 
 Humanitarian, barbarian, but under the sheets 
 It's the player from the point and your girl from the d 
 Are you infatuated with me? 
 I could end your curiosity 
 If you don't think I'm too rude 
 Here's your chance to make your move 
 I sit and wait for nobody 
 People say that my style is so crazy 
 I think you like it, baby 
 Do you want to get nasty? 
 I dare you to undress me 
 Baby, let me know if you want to roll 
 With this hip hop star 
 Bamboos on, pants down low 
 I'm a rock star 
 Baby, let me know if you want to ride with this 
 Hip hop star 
 I'm a rock star 
 Do I blow you away? 
 Do I stimulate your mind? 
 Would you taste my love if I kick it tight? 
 I have none to waste with you 
 I guess you can say 
 My style is so crazy 
 I think you like it, baby 
 Do you want to get messy? 
 I dare you to undress me 
 Undress me, undress me 
 You can come 
 Come, baby, undress me 
 Take off that tank top and pull off them drawers 
 The girls all pause--got 'em drippin' down they sugar walls 
 Oh no, gettin' to the nappy root 
 Knocking boots and stilettos--damn, I keep it ghetto 
 A cool type of fellow, mellow, got the gold medal 
 Never settle for less, my rose petal 
 Tooey, tooey, tooey, spit game 
 Venom to get it up in 'em; let me "p" pop that thing 
 First check her brain to see if she's sane 
 Deranged or strange or crazy as hell 
 You never can tell these days 
 Everybody got a little Rick James in they veins, man 
 The way I feel, ooh, girl, I know it's 'bout to be 
 Me all on you and damn girl you all over me
