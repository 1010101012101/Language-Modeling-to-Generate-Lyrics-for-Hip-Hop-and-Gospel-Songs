Big Boi: 
 Get the south dick up out your mouth 
 What you talkin' 'bout 
 See we know everything you're about 
 So try another route 
 Paperboy, you can't destroy what we done built 
 Pick on somebody your own size and fuck around; get kilt 
 But not like the kilt above the knees 
 BB will plant you niggas like seeds 
 Or fertilizer for the trees 
 Emergency vehicle last seen speeding from the scene 
 Nigga take one for the team; now he's bleeding from the spleen 
 Stay so fresh and oh so motherfucking clean 
 No blood splatter or evidence, long distance with a beam 
 We come in peace, while some of y'all niggas come in greed gluttons 
 Fucking up the game like ice, heroin, or speed 
 Slow down nigga 
 "Speed it up" like ballad of Ricky Bobby, boy go fast 
 Not a hobby, this my life 
 You disrespect it, that's your ass 
 As one half of the outkast return like ghost of Christmas past 
 It's the son of Chico Dusty 
 Must be West Savannah bad 
 Had to go to church on Sundays with Great Grandma and Granddad 
 Taught me always follow Jesus when the grass didn't have a path 
 If I ever fell astray, then God will get me back on track 
 Didn't say that Rico, Ray, and Pat was gettin' with me and 3Stax 
 Then we spittin' cause killing everything that we attack 
 Special forces of the rap game so you best take heed of that 
 All the shit you rappers lack: we got plenty; here's a snack 
 Don't ruin their appetite because your shit is really whack 
 Whack ass nigga 
 This shit's like breathing to me 
 Born and bred for it 
 Big Rube: 
 Another battle won 
 Another story to tell 
 Listen to the angelic plucking of the puppet strings 
 As Sir Lucious puts his left foot forward 
 And rides of into the horizon of infinite regression... victorious 
 Undefeated on the battle field against the means of ignorance, greed, and hatred 
 All contenders to the throne are left naked 
 Because the truth is the only thing you could never be stripped from 
 And if you commit to that truth, then you could end the vicious cycle 
 That's affecting our youth today... 
 If we just stop lying... 
 If we just stop lying... 
 Stop lying... 
 Lying...
