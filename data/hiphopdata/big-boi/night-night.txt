(Verse One: Big Boi) 
 The rhymes I designed are truly unrefined 
 Like diamonds with a spec of blood dug up out a mine 
 Flows flood between the ears right behind my eyes 
 Giving birth to lines, soul searching for the prize 
 I take my time when deciding what to write 
 Like the SAT while these other niggaz bite 
 Underated and mostly hated but got a lot of fight 
 Like a player, play the background, fuck the spotlight 
 Night night, I recite when I step up to this mic 
 Reputation trump tight like the husband want a wife 
 Stay sharp as broken glass, get busted on or smashed 
 When your ass cross paths with this half of the Kast 
 (Chorus One: B.o.B + (Big Boi)) 
 It's bed time, bed time 
 Tuck yourself I can tell that you're terrified 
 Check my record you'll see that I'm verified 
 (Nobody want none) I terrorize 
 (Don't nobody want none) Now you're terrified 
 (Nobody want none of this here) It's bed time 
 (Big Boi talking) 
 Yeah this where second vers supposed to go 
 I don't think I need to hit y'all with another verse 
 But, I think I might, because I like to destroy shit 
 (Verse Two: Big Boi) 
 There's no time to retreat and no surrender 
 Been ready for battle General Patton's no beginner 
 I keep it all Madden, I call the play then execute for the W 
 Leave the rest of you destitute, now put that money up 
 Oh and your content is nonsense; How you expect to 
 Get it a little resitution with all this ghetto flaugin 
 Snow, that's for tobaggans, no won't be no pardons 
 Or bargains, three striked then you +Yank+ed up like +A. Rod+ 
 And, uh, with no apartments, you got no home to run to 
 You snitching on yourself and no it's your front they come through 
 Without a tap on your phone 
 The only thing they had to do is listen to raps on your songs... 
 (Chorus Two: Joi + (Big Boi)) 
 Lights out, the time for the nighty night's overude 
 This is the final countdown to your swan song, you are through 
 All wack emcees and posers this is going out to you 
 Fuck boys will drop their jaws and all because here something new 
 (Something new, something new) ooh-ooh-oh-ooh 
 (Something new, something new) 
 (Verse Three: Big Boi) 
 Straight out the plastic, like a pair of footies, no show 
 My nigga you can't no see me and that's for sho, four door 
 Any kind of Cadillac I go slow, what I'm smoking on 
 Some of that chokehold, no low, no mid 
 Top of the line pine, because I blow big, been here for a while 
 Your momma likes my style, and so do your kids 
 I know you love it, 'cause a hater loves to hate 
 You need me like a junkie needs a razor blade and plate 
 I'm dope nigga 
 (Chorus One) 
 (Chorus Two)
