Been Patient, 
 We both played our part in heart-breakin 
 Most of you hurt more than I've wasted? 
 Took plause to the heart that's family 
 Mamma girl been twenty years a hustler 
 He always talk, never talk shit 
 Go one more place up near to a boss? 
 Couldn't take it so you leave 
 See yo mamma on the couch stressin 
 She lookin' at the clock 
 It's a quarter past ten, 
 Next day and still no sign of daddy. 
 A hustler, always loyal to the customer 
 In love with the only example of family. 
 I wanna take you..? 
 Daddy said when you hit 18, 
 That you would never marry one like me, 
 But didn't know ya fell for 
 A hustler, hustle blood all in me. 
 But I've been waiting for this day to come. 
 Waiting for the day to come 
 Like waitin on the mail man, first of the month Imma, 
 Straight go getta, trendsetter, make a mo when a nigga bust. 
 Dude I keep her soakin wet to the touch, I do. 
 No Joke, can't stop till she get enough, 
 Like a paper top, we could pick her up, blow smoke, chop chop 
 Better hit the blunt, nigga wat up, up, up and away. 
 I ain't fixing to front from the jump, from the getty up bro 
 There plenty pretty bitties in the city I'm from 
 Man I'm gonna get me just one 
 To ride shotgun do you hear me just one, one, one.

 Waiting for this day to come, 
 Lady come and give me some 
 You know you're my only one, 
 Just lay back girl have some fun. 
 Can I come over let me squeeze 
 You so tight girl let me see 
 Just what you can do for me. 
 Drop down low and shake it please. 
 Nothing in the world can keep us apart 
 Like nancy and stevie from the start? 
 My blood pumps red, but give me a purple heart instead 
 Cause a nigga go hard. 
 Kinda like a egg, boiling in a pot of hot water. 
 Or like a fed with a no knock warrant. 
 I want her so imma go an get her 
 You hear me? We got her surrounded, she gonna give it to me. 
 Give it up, give back, hands up, 
 Hand cuff with the wrist back, back up. 
 The type drink to make a nigga act up, 
 Mask up, get the cadillac and mash up. 
 Any, and every, thing on site like a drop-box chevy.
