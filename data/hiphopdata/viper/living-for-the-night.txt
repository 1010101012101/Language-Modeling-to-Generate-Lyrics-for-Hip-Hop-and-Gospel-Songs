Between dusk and day 
 Before the sunrise 
 The city will begin to live its crimes 
 Millions if you ask 
 It happens everywhere 
 Every little corner has its tale 
 Windows are the eyes 
 That witness without soul 
 Watching in the silence what is done 
 I'm a part of this 
 Violence is my friend 
 Walking on the line of life and death 
 Spirits walk the streets 
 Siren sounds alone 
 Screaming out the lyrics of my song 
 I have no other life 
 Concrete is my cage 
 All my disillusions turns to rage 
 I'm living for the night though we have to fear it 
 Where life is just a game that you have to win 
 Living for the night when death surrounds you 
 On and on, all the time it's near 
 I'm longing to be free 
 He even knows my name 
 He wants no waste of time 
 I know that killing is his game and I am the prize 
 Our footsteps sound alone 
 I know he's just behind 
 I feel the panic in our hearts beating very loud 
 I turn my eyes to him 
 The night is very dark 
 He's got a knife and I know 'cause I saw the blade 
 Between the light and shade 
 Between the night and day 
 Between my life and death 
 I only feel the blade 
 Between dusk and day 
 Before the sunrise 
 The city will begin to live its crimes 
 Millions if you ask 
 It happens everywhere 
 Every little corner has its tale 
 Windows are the eyes 
 That witness without soul 
 Watching in the silence what is done 
 I'm living for the night though we have to fear it 
 Where life is just a game that you have to win 
 Living for the night when death surrounds you 
 On and on, all the time it's near 
 Living for the night though we have to fear it 
 Where life is just a game that you have to win 
 Living for the night when death surrounds you 
 On and on, all the time it's near
