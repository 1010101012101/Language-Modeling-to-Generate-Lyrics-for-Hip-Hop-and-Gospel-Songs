Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go 
 I wanna be sedated 
 Nothin' to do and no where to go 
 I wanna be sedated 
 Just get me to the airport 
 Put me on a plane 
 Hurry hurry hurry 
 Before I go insane 
 I can't control my fingers 
 I can't control my brain 
 Oh no no no no no 
 Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go 
 I wanna be sedated 
 Nothin' to do and no where to go 
 I wanna be sedated 
 Just put me in a wheelchair 
 Get me on a plane 
 Hurry hurry hurry 
 Before I go insane 
 I can't control my fingers 
 I can't control my brain 
 Oh no no no no no 
 Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go 
 I wanna be sedated 
 Nothin' to do and no where to go 
 I wanna be sedated 
 Just put me in a wheelchair 
 Get me to the show 
 Hurry hurry hurry 
 Before I go loco 
 I can't control my fingers 
 I can't control my toes 
 Oh no no no no no 
 Ba-ba-bamp-ba ba-ba-ba-bamp-ba I wanna be sedated 
 Ba-ba-bamp-ba ba-ba-ba-bamp-ba I wanna be sedated 
 Ba-ba-bamp-ba ba-ba-ba-bamp-ba I wanna be sedated 
 Ba-ba-bamp-ba ba-ba-ba-bamp-ba I wanna be sedated
