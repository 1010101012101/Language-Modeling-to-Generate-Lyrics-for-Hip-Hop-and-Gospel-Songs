We came to this world breaking the silence 
 Crying for the first air we breath 
 That's how life begins 
 Since we're born our destiny's decided 
 By thousand ways of hating 
 That humankind creates to divide us all 
 But there's only one word 
 Stronger than God 
 Strong enough to save us 
 Save me 
 Love is all that I need 
 To be strong to be free 
 Different creeds, boundaries 
 And ethnics 
 Differences that should enrich us all 
 But oh, Humanity! 
 They took it wrong and now we are watching 
 Growing racism but we keep living our lives 
 Like it's not our fault 
 But there's only one word 
 Stronger than God 
 Strong enough to save us 
 Save me 
 Love is all that I need 
 To be strong to be free 
 All the world is now asking why 
 We close our eyes to the greed of mankind 
 Ruining all our lives 
 But there's only one word 
 Stronger than God 
 Strong enough to save us 
 Save me 
 Love is all that I need 
 To be strong to be free
