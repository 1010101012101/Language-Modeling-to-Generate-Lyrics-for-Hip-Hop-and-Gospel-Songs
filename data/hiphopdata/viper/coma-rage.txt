Coma rage gonna rise everyday 
 Coma rage gonna rise everyday 
 Restless I wait for my time to come 
 To break them all no problem 
 That's my life 
 If you are against you're gonna die 
 Big mistake for you 
 Having no respect for me 
 Now I can destroy you 
 It's fun for me 
 It's fun for me 
 It's fun for me 
 Coma rage gonna rise everyday 
 Youth on edge 
 Coma rage gonna rise everyday 
 To fuck 'em all 
 Coma rage gonna rise everyday 
 Gimme some 
 Coma rage gonna rise everyday 
 Just in time 
 Lonely I face the rage of the world 
 For people like me no future 
 A deadly race 
 We're just part of the game 
 Big mistake for you 
 Having no respect for me 
 Now I can destroy you 
 Fun for me 
 Fun for me 
 Fun for me 
 Coma rage gonna rise everyday 
 Youth on edge 
 Coma rage gonna rise everyday 
 To fuck 'em all 
 Coma rage gonna rise everyday 
 Gimme some 
 Coma rage gonna rise everyday 
 Just in time 
 A good gun in my hands 
 Best way to make you understand 
 That's the way it's gonna be 
 Anytime I meet you in the streets 
 Come rage gonna rise everyday 
 Come rage gonna rise everyday 
 Restless I wait for my time to come 
 To break them all no problem 
 That's my life 
 If you are against you're gonna die 
 Big mistake for you 
 Having no respect for me 
 Now I can destroy you 
 It's fun for me 
 It's fun for me 
 It's fun for me 
 Coma rage gonna rise everyday 
 Youth on edge 
 Coma rage gonna rise everyday 
 To fuck 'em all 
 Coma rage gonna rise everyday 
 Gimme some 
 Coma rage gonna rise everyday 
 Just in time
