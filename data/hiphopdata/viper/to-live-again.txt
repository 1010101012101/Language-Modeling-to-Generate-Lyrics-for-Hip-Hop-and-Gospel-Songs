Prowling through the city 
 Destination nowhere 
 Passing through the windows 
 Of a million lives 
 Drowning in depression 
 Looking for some action 
 An answer to the pain 
 Of my last thousand nights 
 If I had a way 
 To make some moments come back 
 So true and real 
 I will spend my life in memories of the past 
 But nobody lives in dreams 
 And nobody really cares 
 If I'm really fuckin' tired 
 Of this fuckin' life 
 So I head into a bar 
 And I drown all my emotions 
 Forget the disillusionment 
 I have inside 
 If I had a way 
 To make changes in the pages of my past 
 Feelings are to share 
 Everybody needs somebody it's a fact 
 Wrong choice but 
 c'est la vie 
 I'm waiting for the dawn 
 To live again 
 The lonely shades of my days 
 Prowling through the city 
 Destination nowhere 
 Passing through the windows 
 Of a million lives 
 Drowning in depression 
 Looking for some action 
 An answer to the pain 
 Of my last thousand nights 
 If I had a way 
 To make changes in the pages of my past 
 Feelings are to share 
 Everybody needs somebody it's a fact 
 Wrong choice but 
 c'est la vie 
 I'm waiting for the dawn 
 To live again 
 The lonely shades of my days
