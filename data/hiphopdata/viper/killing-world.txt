I killed a cop baby 
 I have to run away 
 Say you never saw me 
 Say you never knew me at all 
 LiFe is so tough baby 
 My future is a promise 
 You don't have to believe it 
 Never bet a dime on me yeah 
 It's a killing world 
 And I can't take it anymore 
 Crush my thoughts till the end 
 And it never ends 
 Inside of me is spinning round and round 
 My killing world 
 I killed myself last night 
 No chance to run away 
 Ain't nobody out there 
 Ain't nobody here to share the pain 
 That's around me 
 Killing world, sick enough 
 Blood fries in my bad brain 
 Drying out the madness in my veins yeah 
 The city in the haze 
 Starts up the dirty race 
 Implanting nightmares by the stack 
 Creates a thousand maniacs 
 I switch to overload 
 Flip to the crazy mode 
 Adrenaline as overdose 
 Down dead end streets 
 That's where it goes
