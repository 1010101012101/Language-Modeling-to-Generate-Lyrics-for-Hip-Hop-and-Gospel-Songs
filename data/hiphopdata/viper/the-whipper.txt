I hear the bells chime in the air 
 I feel the misdeed on this land 
 They deceased with our gods 
 But our faith remains the same 
 They come with crosses, priests and rites 
 Destroying all that in ages we found 
 Disrespecting our rights 
 Spreading the Christ by all the ground 
 You must believe in our true 
 You must drink only of our wine 
 You must follow the sacred Bible 
 Our god will save your life 
 But he is the whipper of our souls 
 Death and fear are his whips 
 And he'll never take my life 
 In my heart he'll never be 
 Fight for your faith, don't be tied by the claws of the whipper 
 Make your mistakes, never follow the laws of the whipper 
 Don't let them choke you, don't let them to kill you by the whipper 
 Keep on your faith that's the only knowledge the whipper 
 How can we make our people 
 Forget this belief 
 Years have passed and consolidated 
 The worst lie that in the world be 
 But I know, the truthful god 
 Has no religion has no rules 
 He's the true that ourselves find 
 And not what the others place in us
