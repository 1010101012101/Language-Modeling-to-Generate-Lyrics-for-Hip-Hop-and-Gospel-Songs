 Damn she smoke my dope 
 Swear to God we go Rambo 
 If you disrespect the dope 
 Straight from Mexico, call her Quintana 
 Damn she smoke my dope 
 Swear to God we go Rambo 
 If you disrespect the dope 
 Praise to the pope, bless you with this dope 
 Step into my world where we get ghost 
 'Cause in my mind we float 
 Everytime we step into 1Oak, they tweaking off the coke 
 Fuck I'm out my mind 
 I'm burning bread so much lets have a toast 
 My niggas and momma know that if I wasn't here 
 Nigga I'd be dead 
 Now I'm in the building thinking billions 
 Counting millions, what a feeling 
 'Member when I never ever made shit? 
 Now me and my niggas rocking chains 
 And whipping slave ships; now who the slave bitch?

 If you disrespect the dope 
 Straight from the lair or Himalayas 
 I got more keys than the mayor, let's have a prayer 
 Kelly Divine off in my pager, I'll hit her later 
 Dawn to dusk I'm trying to get made, I been up for days 
 Damn I'll never pop another pill, man that shit is real 
 Girl you know you fucking with La Flame 
 You know you know the drill 
 I reach to the heavens, lord forgive me I sin 
 May La Flame live forever, and always bring 'em in

 Look, y'all niggas can't fuck with me 
 I've got a bunch of bitches tryna fuck with me 
 I'm unsociable with like most of them 
 'Cause I don't socialize with them suckers, see? 
 Lyrically I will demolish 
 This is the nail in the coffin, niggas is soft 
 Niggas remind me of nails at a spa 
 So under-polished, novices 
 They barkin' up the wrong tree 
 Double M, trust me if you with me then you goin' eat 
 I got them sweatin' like these bitches herein all day 
 And I'm off Atlantic, 2-1 rob 'em, bumbaclot, nigga 
 Not a P-O-K, I'm out for the VS 
 Get lifted, few zips like a Steep Tech 
 Use piff, short words for the loose girls 
 All mine's re-up, y'all regret 
 Don't worry 'bout my team, my team is set 
 Don't worry 'bout T, it's in depth 
 (When it comes to the mothafuckin' c-notes) 
 We'll start us a mothafuckin' glee club 
 God damn... 
 La Flame, don't play no games 
 These niggas is lames 
 These niggas ain't lords, we the new lords 
 Lord, self sacrifice 
 (Mercy me, oh, mercy me) 
 (Mercy me, oh, mercy me) 
 (Mercy me, oh, mercy me) 
 (Mercy me, oh, mercy me)
