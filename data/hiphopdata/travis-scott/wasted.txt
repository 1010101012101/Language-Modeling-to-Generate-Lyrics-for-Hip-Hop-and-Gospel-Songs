Wasted, undone 
 I'm wasted right now 
 Wasted right now 
 Wasted right now 
 Take a sip, drowning in this shit 
 Choppers on my hip, I hold my head 
 I've been taking risks to make that money flip, shots to the head 
 I ain't ordering, I can't afford this shit 
 Go to war with this you overboard, I'm over bored with shit 
 Now it's a pair of player niggas 
 Gotta day to day stack and still I pay accounts 
 20 racks to show just a little allowance 
 Only come to Houston if the boy allow it 
 Bow your head to a real one 
 Coming down with them main niggas 
 H-town don't play with us 
 Them Reddick boys stay with it 
 I've been grinding, slaving over time since I was a fan 
 Looking in the mirror like one day Jacques you gon' be the man 
 One skinny tatted nigga, blunt flicker 
 Young La Flame hot spitter, who can't hold his liquor, yeah 
 It's really going down in the goddamn south 
 I'm trill, I'm country till the end 
 It's really going down in the goddamn south 
 I'm trill, I'm country till the end 
 There's a lot of motherfuckers that can't handle they liquor 
 Can't handle these drugs 
 Wasted, undone 
 It's only real niggas that can handle their shit man 
 Wasted, undone 
 Yeah 
 Wasted, undone 
 So if you tryna get lit, wanna pour up 
 Make sure you stay on our level 'cause we go up 
 Let me see you up 
 Is you wasted baby? 
 One shot, two shots and you still talking crazy 
 3 shots and you faded 
 Freaks coming out at night and they game X rated 
 4 shots now she wanna do the clique 
 Any more shots she ain't gon' remember shit 
 Smoking on extendos, no clips 
 Project hoes going up in the Ritz 
 She gon' do it for a G anything for me bro 
 She just wanna fucking drink and chief all the weed up 
 Sexy bitch pop that pussy cause you in your prime 
 Pour that purple over ice call it turtle time 
 Shawty never been a hesitator 
 Got her going down on the elevator 
 Hear that pussy bomb, I'ma detonate her 
 Fuck her from the back, keep the neck for later 
 No magic trick but I levitate her 
 With the magic stick. nothing less than great 
 When I hit her with the dope D I'm gone 
 Don't text me later, no extra favors 
 It's really going down in the goddamn south 
 I'm trill, I'm country till the end 
 It's really going down in the goddamn south 
 I'm trill, I'm country till the end 
 Weed, lean, MDMA, he say she say 
 All the products of a young man gone the long way 
 From the home that he knew till he roamed where he at 
 And the phone break up, unknown wake up 
 Several one night stands 
 Hung up phone, break up 
 If he fall will he fly? Sure wouldn't take much 
 For you to find out, jump 
 How you took that plunge 
 If not, we're in the same spot 
 How could you judge? 
 How could you judge? 
 Could you judge?
