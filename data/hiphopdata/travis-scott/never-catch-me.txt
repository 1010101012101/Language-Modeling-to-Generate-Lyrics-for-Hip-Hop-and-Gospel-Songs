She take a shot of Hennessy 
 I take a shot of Pimp C and slow up 
 I do this shit for him and me 
 I'm the next lone star to blow-up 
 Picture being locked in a box 
 Selling beats cause you need dollars 
 They say I can make to the league, mama 
 500 dollars all we need, mama 
 Then we gon' be on 
 Tired of seeing the lights off 
 Pops heatin' up the stove 
 Was close to stealing and killing, just to get 'em on 
 Couple drinks down of Ros√© 
 I'm tipsy, y'all faces look like an emoji 
 The rav four turned into a Rover 
 Till it took flight and ended up on the shoulder 
 Now my money a little longer 
 Lookin' back how we finnesin', we ain't know shit 
 They gave me three, got twenty five on the low 
 Who knew that lump sum will get me on 
 My fifty seconds last a little longer, longer 
 I can shit all day, diaper 
 Call that eat all day, itis 
 Will I ever fall off? I doubt it 
 No no no 
 All these diamonds shinin' 
 All this gold on me, all these foes on us 
 How do I dodge these zombies 
 They want my soul from me 
 Know that I'm gone, but one thing 
 They will never catch me 
 Falling off, falling off 
 Never catch me falling off 
 Falling off, never catch me 
 Falling off, falling off 
 Never catch me falling off, falling off 
 Never catch me falling off, falling off
