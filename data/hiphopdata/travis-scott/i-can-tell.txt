I can tell 
 I can tell baby, I can tell 
 I can tell baby, I can tell 
 You ain't told no tales, you ain't told no tales 
 I can tell baby, I can tell 
 I can tell baby, I can tell 
 I can tell baby, I can tell 
 I can tell 
 I can tell 'bout the night tales and the dry spells 
 All the wrong one and the right things to stay away from 
 And how we took off and how we on top 
 And how we won't fall, how we going up 
 Or how we came up, or how we came up 
 It all started in the basement 
 Was an attic but we called that shit the basement 
 Basis to break all my momma's vases 
 I shot my first 8 then nigga I probably wasn't eight then 
 Always hit the gas like I broke wind 
 They said my way of making dollars never made sense 
 Come take a dive a waterfall in the deep end 
 I can tell you 'bout the nights out in Fort Bend 
 I can tell baby, I can tell 
 I can tell baby, I can tell 
 I can tell baby, I can tell 
 I can tell baby, I can tell 
 You ain't told no tales, you ain't told no tales 
 I can tell baby, I can tell 
 I can tell baby, I can tell 
 I can tell baby, I can tell 
 I can tell baby, I can tell 
 No you don't tell 
 Yeah, I can tell 'bout the night tales 
 And all the dry wells and the long roads 
 And all my ideas before the cornrows 
 How we came up and how we came down 
 Going donuts, coffee couldn't help now 
 How we zoned out, made it out the wood now 
 And what it do when they wanna be your friend now 
 How to get it, how to live and get it in now 
 How to great for straight profits making his demands now 
 I been impulsive, non-emotional, staying humble 'bout it 
 Tilt the posture, sick, pass the bottle 
 Five-o-four hot boys, might have to bad rap like Silkk the Shocker 
 But I'mma pull up the silk, to shock her with the silk 
 Nigga you know I been a rocker, dripping milk and knockers 
 Take it up another notcher, take it up another notcher 
 I top a, pop a pill, pop a seal to forget about you 
 I'll bombaclot you, bomba bomba blocka shot you 
 Bling and bang, a bang a rapper 
 Bangarang, I brought my money back 
 Orangutan dollars, ring-a-ling 
 Bitches hanging on my dang-a-lang 
 I can tell baby, I can tell 
 I can tell baby, I can tell 
 I can tell baby, I can tell 
 I can tell baby, I can tell 
 You ain't told no tales, you ain't told no tales 
 I can tell baby, I can tell 
 I can tell baby, I can tell 
 I can tell baby, I can tell 
 I can tell baby, I can tell 
 No you don't tell
