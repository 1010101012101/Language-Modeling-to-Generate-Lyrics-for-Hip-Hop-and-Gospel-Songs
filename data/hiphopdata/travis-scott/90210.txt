Mama's bailing down that road, craving 9021... 
 She a porn star girl, oh, from the valley 
 (Honestly, God Bless) 
 Who left her hometown world all for the alley 
 Oh, created Lake Tahoe all from her panties 
 (I hope it was wet like my jumper, though) 
 Ooh, used to take the long way home, long way home, all for that candy 
 Baby's hooked on feeling numb 
 (Doo doo doo, doo doo doo) 
 Jacques to La Flame, now you rolling on an Addy 
 50 on her chain, 'nother 50 on her caddy, oh 
 He might pop him a pill, pop him a seal, pop anyone 
 Pop anything, pop anything to find that alley 
 Hmm, yeah, then find an alley 
 Baby's hooked on feeling numb 
 (Doo doo doo, doo doo doo) 
 In the 90210, 90210, looking for that alley 
 In the 90210, 90210, looking for that alley, ooh 
 It's the superstar girl, superstar girl, roaming in that alley 
 In the 90210, 90210, somewhere in that alley 
 My granny called, she said "Travie, you work too hard 
 I'm worried you'll forget about me" 
 I'm falling in and out of cuffs, don't worry, I'mma get it, granny 
 What happened? Now my daddy happy, mama called me up 
 That money coming and she love me, I done made it now 
 I done found life's meaning now 
 All them days her heart'd break, her heart not in pieces now 
 Friends turning into fraud niggas 
 Practicing, have the passion, you niggas packaged different 
 All you niggas, you niggas want, that's why you can't have it 
 I'mma sell it, you niggas salad, we 'bout the cabbage 
 Youngest nigga outta Houston at the Grammys 
 Smiling at 'em laughing at me 
 I passed the rock to Ye, he pump faked and passed it back, bitch 
 All of this off of rapping, should've wrote this in Latin 
 Yeah, mmm, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know 
 I know, I know, I know, I know, I know 
 Cuzzo said we in the store, yeah, we 'bout to drop a 4 
 He pass the cigarette, I choke 
 Tell my auntie put them poles down, them poles down 
 Now you know you love your own now 
 Hit the stage, they got their hands up, don't put your nose down 
 I ain't knockin' nigga, I knocked the door down, for sure now 
 Whole crew, I swear they counting on me 
 Gold chains, gold rings, I got an island on me 
 Houses on me, he got them ounces on him 
 Holy father, come save these niggas, I'm styling on 'em 
 Good lord, I see my good fortune in all these horses 
 I'm driving too fast to stop, so all these signs, I ignore them 
 Distant sky from north of the border, my chips is in order 
 My mom's biggest supporter so now niggas support a nigga
