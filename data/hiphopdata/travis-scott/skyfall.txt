Ooh, ah 
 Ooh, ooh, ah 
 Ooh, ah 
 Ooh, ooh, ah 
 I'm trapped in my conscious 
 My trap is still bunkin', look at all of these hundreds 
 Hit up the hood pharmacist, he serve all the muddy 
 Might shoot at your buddy who shot at my buddy 
 The sky keep on fallin', the drugs I keep callin' 
 They keep pickin' up for me, they love me 
 I don't wanna buy, oh no, it won't get me high, oh no 
 I'm trapped in my conscious 
 My trap is still bunky, look at all of these hundreds 
 Hit up the hood pharmacist, he serve all the muddy 
 Might shoot at your buddy who shot at my buddy 
 The sky keep on fallin', the drugs keep on callin' 
 Yeah, that's that loud shit, yeah 
 I been out on my latest trip 
 I've been drunk in my latest whip 
 So I might crash and I asked for it 
 Hit the club for the cougars 
 I never got down with the morals of Martin Luther 
 I'm just tryna ball, why these niggas want me neutered? 
 Got her down to her drawers, trynna get a little nuder 
 They just wanna hang like my nigga Mr. Cooper 
 I'm so 'head of my time, could I show up any sooner? 
 They said I fucked the roommates so you know that just a rumor 
 Have you ever got stoned with your motherfuckin' jeweler? 
 Scott La Flame, no Rick the Ruler, yeah 
 I don't wanna buy no more 
 Your shit ain't gettin' me high no more 
 My trap is still bunky, look at all of these hundreds 
 Might jump with no bungee, I'm gone off that muddy 
 The drugs keep on ca-- I'm trapped in my conscious 
 My trap is still bunky, look at all of these hundreds 
 Might jump with no bungee, get lost in the muddy 
 I might shoot at your buddy who shot at my buddy 
 Where's the love if you love me? 
 And the sky keep on callin', the drugs I keep callin' 
 They keep pickin' up for me, they love me 
 I don't wanna buy no more 
 Your shit ain't gettin' me high no more 
 I'm trapped in my conscious 
 My trap is still bunky, look at all of these hundreds 
 Might jump with no bungee, I'm gone off that muddy 
 The drugs keep on callin', the sky keep on fallin' 
 The drugs keep on callin' 
 The sky keep on fallin', the drugs keep on callin' 
 The sky keep on fallin' 
 The drugs keep on callin', the sky keep on fallin' 
 The sky keep on fallin' 
 The drugs keep on callin', the sky keep on fallin' 
 The sky keep on fallin' 
 The drugs keep on callin', the sky keep on fallin' 
 Look me inside of my eyes 
 All of this pain I'm tryna disguise 
 I'm it, like a game that get played by a kid 
 Pussy boy, I'm on your head like a wig 
 Diamonds water like I bought 'em from a squid 
 A1's what she get when she want dick 
 Black diamonds like I'm Akon kid 
 Whippin' I can turn a two to a six 
 Real talk, on Blood you dead 
 And I still want that head like a lid 
 Hit the school, make it rain on a principal 
 I will leave a nigga smokin' like an Optimo 
 All my bitches they on gringo 
 They ride with heat, ready to sting bro 
 I got 300 bitches like I'm Sosa ho 
 My jewelry shinin' like some Mop and Glo 
 Inside her pants is a camel toe 
 I swear I fell in love with all those 
 I don't wanna buy no more 
 Your shit ain't gettin' me high no more 
 My trap is still bunky, look at all of these hundreds 
 Might jump with no bungee, I'm gone off that muddy 
 The drugs keep on ca-- I'm trapped in my conscious 
 My trap is still bunky, look at all of these hundreds 
 Might jump with no bungee, get lost in the muddy 
 I might shoot at your buddy who shot at my buddy 
 Where's the love if you love me? 
 And the sky keep on callin', the drugs I keep callin' 
 They keep pickin' up for me, they love me 
 I don't wanna buy no more 
 Your shit ain't gettin' me high no more 
 I'm trapped in my conscious 
 My trap is still bunky, look at all of these hundreds 
 Might jump with no bungee, I'm gone off that muddy 
 The drugs keep on callin', the sky keep on fallin' 
 Metro Boomin' want some more nigga
