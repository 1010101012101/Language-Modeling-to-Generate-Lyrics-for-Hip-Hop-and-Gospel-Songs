We wake up when the sun goes down 
 Neighbor says the smell's too loud 
 Riding in my old school thang 
 Shotgun with my old school babe 
 So wake me when the sun goes down 
 Tonight's my last night in town 
 I pledge to a flag so grey 
 No matter what time the skies are grey 
 The sky is grey 
 Around this time, was starving, no Ramadan 
 Mighta robbed you blind 
 You, you, you, your dad and moms 
 Yeah, keep that in mind 
 Fear two things: being broke and dying 
 Jump your ass inside, LSD come take this ride 
 No A-C-I-D, how you get your ass inside 
 Good, take one peek at me, you might get lost in my mind 
 Yea, fuck that college shit, that scholarship, let's hypnotize 
 Yeah, ooh 
 We wake up when the sun goes down 
 Neighbor says the smell's too loud 
 Riding in my old school thang 
 Shotgun with my old school babe 
 So wake me when the sun goes down 
 Tonight's my last night in town 
 I pledge to a flag so grey 
 No matter what time the skies are grey 
 The sky is grey 
 Might be the last time I trip 
 I know I said this shit last time 
 But damn I never had a trip like this 
 Who knew a threeway on freeway can trip with three hoes to a sixway 
 Ain't gotta finesse out the midway 
 So Bird can wrap birds in that bengay 
 No more, goddamn 
 And pops never gave me shit 
 But pops ain't raised no bitch 
 I swung, I missed, he swung, he hit, then I hit that ditch 
 Raised in a town where it looked so good outside like it ain't that serious 
 My nigga got dumb years doing dumb shit 
 Locked up in the car, had to pull a gun quick 
 Killa tatted on his face, leaked to his conscious 
 Now he stuck in a cell, know he feeling nauseous 
 The nigga so good, he was so cold 
 Another lost kid, Mo City soul 
 The sky is grey
