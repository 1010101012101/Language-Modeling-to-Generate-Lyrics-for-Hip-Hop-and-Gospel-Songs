Got my nigga Easy in this motherfucker 
 Deadstock sixes and shit 
 Got my nigga Metro in this motherfucker 
 By the bar, buy the bar bitches on my table everywhere 
 On the floor condoms on my dresser 
 On my business, never plannin' 
 Never sober thinkin' blew me up 
 Body shots took on your bitches titties 
 Slow it down, pick it up, fuck a third 
 Speed the fourth gear grindin' up on everything it's my year 
 I got it now, everything I ever asked for 
 We gettin' it, far from mama's jeep she never tinted it 
 She frozed up, I unfrozed her, now come a little closer 
 Get your ass up off that wall and go roll up that doja 
 Tell your boyfriend bust that key go ahead and fill that nose up 
 Till it's over, we ain't lookin' for the hoes where the trophies 
 Grab a glass go ahead get throwed up 
 She feelin' it, don't spill the shit 
 She crazy, she goin', she goin' 
 Gone! 
 All this money on the table 
 We don't want relations 
 We don't want no conversations 
 Fuck around and change the weather 
 Damn I'm with my main bitch 
 And I don't love her no mo' 
 Drinkin' fuck a limitation 
 I done made it out the basement 
 Fuck around and change the weather 
 I'm off a bean, I'm off a bean 
 See this lean it's in my dreams 
 Off the dope, don't wanna smoke 
 Off this roll I might just roll 
 Let's get throwed 
 Out in Houston they know my name 
 In MO city they know the gang 
 Young La Flame ain't nothin' changed 
 But the chains and diamond rings 
 Diamond rings, I lost my brains me and Ye Ye 
 Out in broad day 
 I'm on the 3rd coast 
 Eatin' Burlow with Merlot 
 I got my shirt off 
 Kickin' dirt off 
 Out in Bergdorf 
 She like what you doin'? 
 It took a path just to get me here 
 Don't give a damn if that's ruined 
 Later on got a ring, ring, ring 
 She at my doorbell ding, ding, ding, ding 
 Let the bitch in the bitch seen bang out bang out 
 On the couch, on the floor, in her mouth 
 Cameras out 
 Once my dick's in no pulling out 
 That's my baby straight up 
 Bitch been doing coke since the 80's 
 I'm a 90's baby 
 Young La Flame you know he crazy 
 All this money on the table 
 We don't want relations 
 We don't want no conversations 
 Fuck around and change the weather 
 Damn I'm with my main bitch 
 And I don't love her no mo' 
 Drinkin' fuck a limitation 
 I done made it out the basement 
 Fuck around and change the weather
