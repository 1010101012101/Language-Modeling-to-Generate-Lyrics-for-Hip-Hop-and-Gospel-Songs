10-201, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 Smokin' big, drankin' syrup, know what I'm talkin' 'bout? 
 What, sucker free, what, what 
 I can do dat (I can do dat right there) 
 I can do dat, ay 
 If I spill drank on my clothes - I can do dat 
 It don't matter 'cause I buy me some more - I can do dat 
 I'ma spend about fifty in the mall - I can do dat 
 I'ma buy me a Bentley in the fall - I can do dat 
 I'ma stop weak niggas from rappin'... 
 I, can't, leave, drank alone 
 It got me feenin' (Feenin', feelin' good 
 Feelin' like a boss as I'm creeping through my hood) 
 Feel like I'm on the drive to the moon 
 Man I thought the world was ending soon 
 Damn a brother stay tested and the devil wear Prada 
 (Just trynna go up the avenue) 
 Sometimes I drive 
 While I'm staring in your eyes 
 With my hands behind your head 
 While you take me away 
 Whether I'm shinin' all winter or chillin' all summer 
 We rockin' furs, look like I copped 'em straight out the jungle 
 Used to spend cheese up on the steez, yeah I remember 
 Used to take trips whippin' the Jeep that my mom loaned us 
 Ridin' real slow 
 Mmhm, that the shit they didn't know 
 Cruisin' down 59 seeing niggas ridin' fours, I just stared at the stars 
 And looked with my eyes closed 'cause it's driving me wild 
 Sometimes I drive 
 While I'm staring in your eyes 
 With my hands behind your head 
 While you take me away 
 Hit the weed and just drive 
 Hit the weed and just drive 
 Hit the weed and just drive 
 Hit the weed and just drive 
 Oh yeah 
 Sometimes I drive 
 While I'm staring in your eyes 
 With my hands behind your head 
 While you take me away 
 Junior! 
 Fuck... 
 Junior, turn that shit off! 
 Man, for what, nigga? 
 What'd I tell you about playing' that loud ass music in this fuckin' house? 
 Fuck! Fuckin' drums crazy...
