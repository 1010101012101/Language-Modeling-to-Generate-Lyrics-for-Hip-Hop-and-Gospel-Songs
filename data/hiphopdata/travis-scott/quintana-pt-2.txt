I'm finessin', finessin' (straight up) 
 I came up 100 bands a week, straight off finessin' 
 La Flame 
 Walked in this bitch 
 I just got through finessin' designer (straight up) 
 Oh my God it's no rental 
 Gold plated, no need to remind you 
 Robbed my plug 
 That nigga wasn't getting me higher (that dope) 
 Oh no no, oh no no no no no no no 
 Black on black as True Religion (straight up) 
 This that shit that keep you geekin' (bando) 
 I done fucked me 'round 5 bad bitches this morning (La Flame) 
 And I ain't goin' back unless they horny 
 Oh no no, oh no no no no no no no 
 Finessing, finessing (straight up) 
 I can't go one day without finessing (La Flame) 
 Finessing, finessing (bando) 
 I came up a hundred bands a week straight off finessing 
 Straight up, straight up 
 I came up a hundred bands a week straight off finessing 
 Been on that weed with my team 
 Rolling with my team, yeah we all finessing 
 Man here it go, fishcale, A1 perico 
 Fill PJ's up with kilos, then sell it like it's legal, yeah 
 Everybody he know could have gotten hit with the RICO 
 Caught a couple of charges they was weak though 
 Feds had to let him go in a week or so 
 Still, still need the key to blow, whole heap of dough 
 Ran the streets for so long, man the team was so on 
 Damn it seem like so long ago, we had 'em in Mexico 
 He tryna' make it back, three bricks more 
 The, people always run up on us in Texas though 
 Only by the grace of God they ain't catch us though 
 Some lil young nigga with some big dreams 
 Almost on the verge of doing some big things 
 Tryna' get a bird since he was sixteen 
 And now he playin' 'round with fifteen or more, ay 
 You know a nigga love nice things 
 And the price in the hood is too frightening 
 Them niggas ain't gon' do the right thing 
 Except for me to do my thing, hey! 
 Finessing, finessing (straight up) 
 I can't go one day without finessing (La Flame) 
 Finessing, finessing (bando) 
 I came up a hundred bands a week straight off finessing 
 Finessing, finessing (straight up) 
 I can't go one day without finessing (La Flame) 
 Finessing, finessing (bando) 
 I came up a hundred bands a week straight off finessing 
 Straight up, straight up 
 How high 
 Tell me why she wanna leave me 
 She used me to get high 
 Oh she used me to get higher, higher, higher 
 So tell me why she wanna leave me 
 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
 (As the days go on, the southern region of our national anthem 
 The quest for La Flame, this journey, it's the last days)
