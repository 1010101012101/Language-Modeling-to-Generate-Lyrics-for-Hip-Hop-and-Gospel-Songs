And the kids sing 
 Yeah, I like that, I like that, kids sing 
 We will understand if they don't 
 We don't want they bullshit no more 
 Alright, alright, alright 
 You take too many martinis, she slip straight out bikini 
 She let me grand slam outside the Denny's 
 How we gone get Oscar proud if they pay us pennies? 
 I'mma need my dollars now, stack it till they envy 
 Ya feel me? 
 The kids they need that 
 I get that feedback, sit back, relax 
 I'm on that relapse 
 Yo ass gone die if you blow my high 
 I been over Coastin' just was beatin' in my lotus 
 All that loud talk like your dope we never notice 
 You ain't feelin' it, nigga, 'cause you sober 
 I'm ballin' in the game with players, you behind the coaches 
 Come take a trip on my lair by the Third Coast 
 Come floatin' 
 La di, da, di, da, di, all the kids shout at the party 
 We will understand if they don't 
 We don't want they bullshit no more 
 You know when I was fourteen 
 I wanted to do a lot of kick ass shit 
 Yeah 
 Pornographic, so dramatic, cinematic 
 Diamond flashes, so drastic, dress so classic 
 Roll that cabbage, get put in casket, you dope fanatic 
 You the baddest, I'm sarcastic, we both laughin' 
 I'm the baddest, I'm out in traffic foreign gym baggin' 
 Stuffed in Suburban, twelve bitches straight out the beauty pageant 
 You know Reebok keep La feet hot, they be shipping package 
 GL 600 or the palace that collab with classics 
 Tell me what you need, I got everything green 
 Money, money, money trees, I buy everything 
 That bitch need no wedding ring, she need a bean 
 That boy walked in mall, that boy he need a beam 
 I done fucked her twice you bought her fendi things 
 I done sipped the act Now Imma leany fiend 
 I can do this by myself, don't need no team 
 I got all these kids and all these kids gone sing 
 We will understand if they don't 
 We don't want they bullshit no more
