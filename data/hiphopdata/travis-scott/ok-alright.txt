 Leaders of the new school 
 They ain't want to let us in but they had to

 Four ways, now it's time to pay 
 Need my money now, not tomorrow need that shit today 
 Okay, okay, okay

 Bitches kissing bitches while my niggas serve them candy canes

 Crib where the cop won't go 
 Rollie on bling bling, neck on ice 
 Tell a bitch get right, make a nigga miss that flight 
 Can a nigga hit that twice 
 Should have never let us niggas in 
 Got my first M 2012 
 Now a hundred K in the mail 
 Free another hommie on bail 
 Money low her pussy gon' sell 
 Tryna tell me money ain't shit 
 When you tried to tell me water won't whip 
 When you tried to say this quarter won't flip 
 Since Snoop who the other rich crip 
 How Groovy get the Pringle man chip 
 Walk on with a twenty yard clip 
 Walk on while a real nigga limp 
 Black nigga green grass no golf 
 So on turn the satellite off from the set 
 Feel like I died on that cross hang on 
 Okay, okay, okay 
 Already know it's gon' be all right 
 Way we going up we might be all night 
 Okay, okay 
 Now we gon' blow like the wind 
 Should have never let us niggas in

 Take the long way home 
 All right, all right, all right 
 All right, all right 
 All right, all right, all right, all right 
 Jacques was born April 30 aye 
 Doctor said he won't be home in thirty days

 Momma said her son gon' be a gift

 Daddy out there hanging with the killers 
 Will it be all right, all right, all right, all right? 
 Feel like I'mma need me a sip 
 Feel like I'mma need me a bitch 
 Make me feel all right, all right, all right, all right 
 There's blood on your face 
 Salt on your skin

 Scrape a little off the top
