Nine light years away, just outside of the Kepler solar system 
 We find ourself consumed and utterly mesmerized 
 With a story of a young rebel against the system 
 Refusing to conform or comply to the ways of authority 
 He chose the mood of "fuck this shit" 
 At that moment, the one known as Jacq turned to Scott 
 Chose to jump off his mama porch and lead the stampede of lost souls 
 In the middle of their metamorphosis, not quite through with their journey 
 Ain't made it through whatever the fuck they gon' be in life 
 But whatever it is, it's better than here 
 So fuck you and fuck this 
 No monogamy, ménage with me 
 Pornography surrounding me 
 You get high with me, you come down with me 
 That's all I need in my fantasy 
 All these flashing lights 
 Give you some of me, you want all of me 
 And get high with me, and come down with me 
 Yeah that's all I need in my fantasy 
 You remind me of my ex, crazy love 
 We designed our love around the drugs 
 We both feelin' this cup, we both tryna fuck 
 I'mma rub a dub, tryna get a nut 
 No monogamy, ménage with me 
 Pornography surrounding me 
 You get high with me, you come down with me 
 That's all I need in my fantasy 
 All these flashing lights blinding me 
 Give you some of me, you want all of me 
 And get high with me, and come down with me 
 That's all I need in my fantasy 
 The story of the bastard was never told 
 The soul of a bastard was never sold 
 Can he survive? Or could he fall in love? 
 Living like a bronco, lifestyle wild and untamed 
 Sit sip at the top, a long list of no named 
 Misfits can't wait to get a chance to say fuck you to the ones that say fuck you 
 Tell 'em do ya thing, Codeine and cocaine cartels 
 Who leads the charge of this young mob? 
 La flame he is in his head, the world is yours 
 Wake up nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga 
 Niggas in the bushes in the farms 
 Might gotta got to rake up a nigga 
 I'm way too antsy, cause my ambition's too frantic 
 I might need to move to Atlantis, cause my mind's too outlandish 
 It's the rodeo, time to get started 
 Houston nigga, goin' James Harden 
 They would swallow all the niggas in the projects 
 Wonder why a nigga went cold hearted 
 They wanna put my soul up on an auction 
 But I'mma make 'em take the fall like August 
 And they gon' vote me right in on my caucus 
 And I'mma show these niggas how to get lawless 
 Why your hands out, asking "could you hold one?" 
 Who do I owe, nigga, no one 
 They bigging you up but you low down 
 Animated acting frozen 
 I got porno pics, wish I can post them 
 Stackin' Franklins, I can't fold 'em 
 Niggas askin' for the old him 
 But I'm way too young to be the old him 
 I'mma make this chick crack Lamar Odom 
 Till I climb to the top of the podium 
 So wake up nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga 
 Niggas in the bushes, niggas on the farm 
 Might gotta rake up a nigga 
 I'm way too antsy, cause my ambition's too frantic 
 I might move out to Atlantis, cause my mind's too outlandish 
 We gon' rule the world, we gon' rule the world 
 We gon' rule the world 
 La Flame says "let your ambition carry you"
