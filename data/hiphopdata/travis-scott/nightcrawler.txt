Did you have the time of your life? 
 Let's have the after party at my place 
 Do you have some spare change? 
 On me I've got hundreds I'll throw in your face 
 Yeah, order more bottles, order more models 
 Order more hours, shots on an island 
 Hotter than the summer, the winter couldn't chill me 
 Young free and wildin', order more kidneys 
 Dope, I sold dope 
 All these hotties poppin' on the floor 
 And we're stuntin', know you see the GLO 
 Girl these hundreds, thought I'd let you know 
 Since LA, I've been puttin' on 
 Cirque De Soleil, I've been on and on 
 I got this money, tell me what you want 
 For this money, can you drop it low? 
 Yeah, order more bottles, order more models 
 Order more hours, shots on an island 
 Hotter than the summer, the winter couldn't chill me 
 Young free and wildin', order more kidneys 
 When the night calls, ooh 
 When the night calls, ooh 
 Yeah, order more bottles, order more models 
 Order more hours, shots on an island 
 Hotter than the summer, the winter couldn't chill me 
 Young free and wildin', so order more kidneys 
 Freaks come out at night 
 We bring our fantasy to life 
 Point me to the ice 
 And I don't need your drank, high off life 
 Someone kill the lights 
 I brought the party favors, just get piped 
 All my bitches right 
 But I want you and you tonight 
 Yeah, order more bottles, order more models 
 Order more hours, shots on an island 
 Hotter than the summer, the winter couldn't chill me 
 Young free and wildin', so order more kidneys 
 When the night calls 
 All the money, all the hoes and the alcohol 
 All these hundreds and these thousands I'ma spend it all 
 Always when the night calls 
 When the night calls 
 We want money, we want hoes, we want alcohol 
 All these hundreds and these thousands I'ma spend it all 
 Always when the night calls 
 Aye, walked up in the bank, ordered me some funds 
 Walked in the strip club, order me some ones 
 I walked up in the gun store, order me some guns 
 Your bitch walked up in the spot and she ordered me for lunch 
 I just ordered me some brunch, curry and spicy garlic 
 Bitch I come from eating McDonald's 
 Girl you know I'm from the projects 
 I'm a G I come through ma like Wu-T-A-N-G we come through wildin' 
 I ain't chillin', Caesar with the chopper, boy you don't blow no poles, I know 
 I got me some angles

 I got me some feds, I got me some cake 
 I got me some UPS, I got me a freight 
 Order some more money, order some more money 
 Order some more money, order some more bottles 
 Order some more bitches, order some more money 
 I know you want to be rich, bitch 
 When the night crawls 
 All the money, all the ass and the alcohol 
 All these hundreds and these thousands, I'ma spend it all 
 Always when the night calls 
 When the night calls 
 We want money, we want hoes, we want alcohol 
 All these hundreds, all these thousands, I'ma spend it all 
 Always when the night calls

 All the money, all the ass and the alcohol 
 All these hundreds and these thousands, I'ma spend it all 
 Always when the night calls 
 When the night calls 
 We want money, we want hoes, we want alcohol 
 All these hundreds, all these thousands, I'ma spend it all 
 Always when the night calls
