Bad, bad news 
 I'm just bad, bad news 
 Good thing that you, Bonnie and Clyde 
 The money and who? 
 It's bad news 
 Bad, bad for you 
 But I'm back on the coffee bean 
 Anything in between (this is all, this is all) 
 Back of the coffee line 
 Back, back, back in the bathroom line (this is all) 
 How would you feel if I had you? 
 Trust me, you'd be mad too 
 Shawty, we can be mad cool 
 Just hit me if anything past due 
 Your family told you I'm a bad move 
 Plus I'm already a black dude 
 Leavin' the bathroom, my hands is half-rinsed 
 If only a nigga just had sense 
 Speaking in past tense 
 It's been a week and a half since 
 We ain't been speaking in mad mins 
 You feeling free in my absence 
 I've been going through a lot behind this glass tint (this is all, this is all) 
 Back of the coffee line 
 Back, back Back in the bathroom line (this is) 
 I know they told you I'd be bad for you 
 Don't worry I'll be back for you 
 All the money and cars 
 Stripper hoes and the tattoos 
 Bad news 
 Back off a coffee bean 
 Reflecting on all you see (this is all, this is all) 
 Stressing over award shows 
 She's stressin' over her wardrobe 
 Bought the mansion on foreclose 
 No matter how many tickets your tour sold 
 You feel this deep in your torso 
 Feel like someone's readin' your horoscope 
 Some shit only me and the Lord knows 
 SOS, that's for those who hear this in morse code 
 Too many doors closed Cul-de-sacs and foreign doors 
 Still ended meet up at the North Pole 
 This is where remorse goes 
 Shoulda had you in Divorce Court 
 Fighting over your seeds, writing over your D's, sliding over your keys 
 Alimony and fees, as your lawyer proceeds 
 To give out bad news 
 I'm just bad, bad news 
 Good thing, but you was right 
 The money and who? 
 It's bad news 
 Bad, bad for you 
 But I'm back on the coffee bean 
 Anything in between (this is all, this is all) 
 Back of the coffee line 
 Back, back, back in the bathroom line (This is all)
