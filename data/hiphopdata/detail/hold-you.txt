The badest remix you're gonna hear in your life 
 She is bad yeah she is bad 
 Let's go 
 Hello 
 She is bad she is fly 
 I can see it from the corner of my eye 
 Let's go 
 In at the club out of the club 
 See ... with the one I love 
 In at the club out of the club 
 See ... with the one I love 
 I am not gonna stop until I got you in my life 
 Not gonna stop until you are by my side 
 I am not gonna stop cause it feels so right 
 Girl let's go 
 She is bad yeah she is bad 
 Let's go 
 Hello

 I can see it from the corner of my eye

 Not gonna stop until you are by my side 
 I am not gonna stop cause it feels so right 
 I just wanna get you back to the 
 So fly looking like a home run 
 Out at the park got ...

 I like girls that like cars 
 See it when I see it 
 I refuse to be lost when I am out here 
 She is bad yeah she is bad 
 Let's go 
 Hello

 I can see it from the corner of my eye 
 Let's go 
 In at the club out of the club 
 See ... with the one I love 
 In at the club out of the club 
 See ... with the one I love 
 I am not gonna stop until I got you in my life 
 Not gonna stop until you are by my side 
 I am not gonna stop cause it feels so right
