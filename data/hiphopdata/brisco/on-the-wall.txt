[Chorus - Lil Wayne] X2 
 She want to get it so she do me all up on the wall 
 She want to get it so she do me all up on the wall 
 I want to get it so I do her all up the wall 
 I want to get it so I do her all up the wall 
 (Verse 1 - Brisco) 
 Yeah, I be that nigga Brisco 
 When I come through they know I'm known to ball 
 She sipping Nuvo while I'm puffing, got them on the wall 
 Got the spliff, high stick 
 Hands on the handle bars 
 Hop in, let the top back now I'm in my lane, bowling ball 
 Ha, I might be going about a hundred miles 
 Sipping on that Henny in that 'Ghini I be going hard 
 She like "don't leave me Papa" 
 I'm not a G but I be here you ever need me, need me 
 (Verse 2 - Brisco) 
 I do her all up on the wall 
 Shawty done forgot her draws 
 Check the bathroom and bye, bye I'ma beat her in the stall 
 Everybody on the wall 
 And we on that alcohol 
 Shit can happen, clap clapping, round of applause 
 Ha, I might be going about a hundred miles 
 Sipping on that Henny in that 'Ghini I be going hard 
 She like "don't leave me Papa" 
 I'm not a G but I be here you ever need, me need me 
 (Verse 3 - Brisco) 
 I'm under her arrest, my hands completely cuffed 
 She always in control 
 I know she like it rough 
 Never let her fuss 
 Never try to call her phone 
 Just hit her with a text, to let her know it's on 
 Throw her all up on the wall 
 Now I'm all up on her fanny 
 She probably South Beach 
 Fontainebleau Miami 
 I know she want to get it 
 And I'm so quick to get it 
 I always pull her hair 
 And ask her how it feel 
 Brisco
