Shit I got a, couple blocks up in Georgia nigga 
 I got a, little brother cooking quarters 
 I got a new trapper Vel Doston nigga 
 Nigga front there be some birds, and I ain't calling nigga 
 Straight gorilla, extortion niggas know what's up 
 All black Grandville cruise, nobody noticed us 
 I raced ahead in the last leg 
 Conspiracy was alaised by the last FEDS 
 I was acquitted in the last case 
 Got my weight up I refuse to be in last place 
 Pyrex full of that raw, cooking that hard, cut it to rocks 
 Shred the script and flood the block 
 I got a couple ki's in Charleston nigga 
 A bad breezy up in Boston, stalk a nigga 
 I got a, safe house from Safe City 
 Every rental I rent, plates tinted, and it got weight in it 
 On turnpikes I turn white to ice, four or five tennis chains 
 And Cartier eyesight, yes 
 Cuban connect, call them my Legos 
 A Milton Bradley homeboy, I got the game sold 
 I play with dough like Lil Bris play with Play-Doh 
 A quarter ki to chicken leg, I flip them like Fabos 
 What the game owe me, was a G pass 
 Now I'm serving off the rock like Steve Nash 
 My speed fast only E-Class bash 
 When you see me and E-Class, know we see cash
