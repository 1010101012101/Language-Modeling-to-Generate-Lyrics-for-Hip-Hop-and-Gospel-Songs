 Brisco 
 : 
 I'm posted on the corner, twisting that good 
 I got that all black dickie on, I'm keepin' it hood 
 What it is, I'm the Obalocka boom 
 Got work in the trap, and the Chevy droppin' soon 
 See Cash Money rubberbands e'm, bands e'm 
 Since I got the deal, I got girls say'n he so handsome 
 I'm a Dave County, Yorker Boy 
 I earn stripes, I got soldiers that'll flop you 4 it 
 Now I'm bouncin' with a hood rat 
 She think I love her, but I use her 4 her food stamps 
 Mr. Ghetto, It's whateva, you group it, I'm shootin 
 And don't worry about them smokers, we keepin' it movin 
 I know Cubans that knows O's 
 If I ask for it, they send it by the boat load 
 Weezy Wee, I think it's a wrap 
 And If you need me, you know where to find me at 
 I'm in the hood 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood 
 Just sayin' if you look'n 4 me... I'm in the hood 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood

 Just sayin' if you look'n 4 me... I'm in the hood 
 Lil Wayne 
 : 
 Uptown New Orleans, like always 
 Cash Money boy, shine like ball heads 
 Big Bezel make my watch look like a hog head 
 And all I do is smoke trees, call me log head 
 I'm butter on the bread like Parkay 
 And I am all about me like Doe Ray (?) 
 I'm in the hood, I'm the hood like Dope, Yay 
 Nappy ass hair like Buckwheat, Otay 
 Hollygrove, Ether St. be my damn hood 
 Where you can get murdered for free like can goods 
 I got 12 bar rooms under the lamb hood 
 I can bring a Kentucky Derby to the damn hood 
 Sunshine diamonds help me tan good 
 And I'll let it blow like a band wood 
 I call Briscoe, I'm on South Beach 
 30 mins. later, Obalocka is where I'll be 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood 
 Just sayin' if you look'n 4 me... I'm in the hood 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood 
 Just sayin' if you look'n 4 me... I'm in the hood 
 Brisco 
 : 
 Like Kroger cups, watered juice, pickled eggs, and pig feet 
 If you got beef, you know just where to find me 
 I'm in the hood, or better yet, the projects 
 Where baby mama's trippin' and them goons livin' heartless 
 3 rules, Get money, don't tell 
 And if that Welfare check come late, raise hell 
 I'm a poor boy, I ain't got shit 
 And I hope they don't tell Baby, I'ma hit me a lick 
 (Lil Wayne:) 
 Man, I'm so Hollygrove 
 Stand strong in that water like a Commodor 
 Black holes in yo' white tee, Dominoes 
 Me and Briscoe, Cash Money carnivores 
 I am New Orleans like carnivals 
 And in the hood, call me Weezy the honorable 
 These other rappers so ironicle 
 And if I ain't in the mansion then I'm up in the Phantom or... 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood 
 Just sayin' if you look'n 4 me... I'm in the hood 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood 
 Just sayin' if you look'n 4 me... I'm in the hood 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood 
 Just sayin' if you look'n 4 me... I'm in the hood 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood 
 I'm in the hood, I'm in the, I'm in the hood 
 Just sayin' if you look'n 4 me... I'm in the hood
