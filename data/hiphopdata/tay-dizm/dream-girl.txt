(Tay Dizm) 
 Nappy Boy! 
 Ooowww! 
 (Chorus: Akon) 
 (She's just the type) That I been searchin' for all my life 
 (The type) That'll make a nigga feel so right 
 (The type) That I rather make love than fight 
 (The type) That gets it poppin' every single night 
 She's my dream giiiirl, my one and only 
 My dream giiiiirl, love it when she call on me 
 She's my dream giiiiirl, my lover, my homie 
 My dream giiiirl, it's just me and you against the world. 
 (Tay Dizm) 
 Ass poked out like Lisa Ray, 
 Janet hips, thighs, waist, 
 Gabrielle Union's face 
 Strapped with Oprah Winfrey's cheeks, 
 In a house on a hill in the West Indies 
 If you let me I could give you anything that you need 
 Speedin', switchin' lanes, wide open 
 She what I'm lookin' fo', fo' certain 
 There's no person that could take your place 
 I'm like a fat kid with cake when we face to face 
 Heart paced when you're here but erased when you're gone 
 Kinda hard to pick a team when your racin' alone. 
 (Chorus: Akon) 
 (She's just the type) That I been searchin' for all my life 
 (The type) That'll make a nigga feel so proud 
 (The type) That'd rather make love than fight 
 (The type) That gets it poppin' every single night 
 She's my dream giiiirl, my one and only 
 My dream giiiirl, love it when she call on me 
 She's my dream giiiirl, my lover, my homie 
 My dream giiiirl, it's just me and you against the world. 
 (Tay Dizm) 
 First time nigga Dizm put his eyes on you 
 No lie girl, I feel like my dream came true 
 You and I plus ten, and a little bit more 
 And the motions in your hips got your boy like Whoa! 
 You the type of girl that'd keep a dude fiendin for more 
 If you feel like I feel girl, please let me know 
 *Indistinct* thought of you 
 I got plans for us to follow through 
 You my dream girl, baby so it's all about you, 
 Twenty-four seven 
 Girl I'm all about you (and that's real) whenever you need me girl I'm right here 
 (Chorus: Akon) 
 (She's just the type) That I been searchin' for all my life 
 (The type) That'll make a nigga feel so proud 
 (The type) That I'd rather make love than fight 
 (The type) That gets it poppin' every single night 
 She's my dream giiiirl (YAY!), my one and only 
 My dream giiiirl (OK!), love it when she call on me 
 She's my dream giiiirl (Yeah!), my lover, my homie 
 My dream giiiirl, it's just me and you against the world (the world, the world) 
 (Tay Dizm) 
 She's my dream giiirl, gonna make her my only 
 She's my dream giiirl, I want you to put it on me 
 She's my dream giiirl, wanna make her my baby 
 I'm goin' crazy for you (for you) 
 (She's just the type) That I been searchin' for all my life 
 (The type) That'll make a nigga feel so proud 
 (The type) That I'd rather make love than fight 
 (The type) That gets it poppin' every single night 
 She's my dream girl, my one and only 
 My dream girl, love it when she call on me 
 She's my dream girl, my lover, my homie 
 My dream girl, it's just me and you against the world.
