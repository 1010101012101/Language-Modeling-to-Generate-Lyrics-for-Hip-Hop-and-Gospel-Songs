Yes it was many years ago 
 I was fourteen years old 
 When I first heard that Wolfman's howl 
 Yes he sneaked me through the door 
 There was whiskey on the floor 
 And the fuzz it was on the prowl 
 Well it seems so long ago 
 I'm living on the highway now 
 Well he's a giant of a man 
 He always understands 
 The very best notes to use 
 Yes his hand makes two of mine 
 His heart beats right on time 
 He taught me how to sing the blues 
 Yes he's the reason why I choose 
 And living on the highway now, yeah 
 Well I played the blues with Waters 
 And Muddy pulled me through 
 I know a Jimmy Rogers song or two 
 But there's one thing that I know 
 No matter where I go 
 I can do a little howling too 
 Yeah that's why I sing the blues 
 I'm living on the highway now 
 Well the years have come and gone 
 But the blues still go on 
 I only sing my songs for fun 
 Yes well if you want me to 
 I'll do a song for you 
 'Cause the women like to see me come 
 Yes my guitar and my band 
 We're living on the highway now, yeah
