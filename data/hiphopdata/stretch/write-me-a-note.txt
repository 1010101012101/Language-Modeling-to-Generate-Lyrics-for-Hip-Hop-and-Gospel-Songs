I don't know whether it's wrong or right 
 But I've got to get away tonight 
 'Cause I can't tell whether you love me still the same 
 So I'm giving you the chance to find somebody new 
 If that's what you wanna do 
 But if you don't write me a note, I'll come on home 
 I can't help feeling the way I do 
 So now my love, it's up to you 
 'Cause I can't stand thinking that you might not be sure 
 And if you decide that you like being free 
 Then that's how it has to be 
 But if you don't write me a note, I'll come on home 
 I'm so alone, I see you everywhere I turn my head 
 As time goes on, I love you more each day 
 But if I don't find your letter asking for me to come back home 
 Then I know that it's just gotta be that way 
 I'm so alone, I see you everywhere I turn my head 
 As time goes on, I love you more each day 
 But if I don't find your letter asking for me to come back home 
 Then I know that it's just gotta be that way 
 I don't know whether it's wrong or right 
 But I've got to get away tonight 
 'Cause I can't tell whether you love me still the same 
 So I'm giving you the chance to find somebody new 
 If that's what you wanna do 
 But if you don't write me a note, I'll come on home 
 But if you don't write me a note, I'll come on home 
 But if you don't write me a note, I'll come on home
