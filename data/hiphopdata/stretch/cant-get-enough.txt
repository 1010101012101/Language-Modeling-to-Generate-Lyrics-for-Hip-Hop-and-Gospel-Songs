Well you're loving your wheels 
 And you drive down the street 
 There's a smile on your face 
 'Cause you're feeling so neat 
 Got your baby in tag 
 And you're out on the town 
 And you pick up a bag 
 And you get on down 
 You're a Friday night 
 You and your baby feel alright? 
 Oh Lord, I heard that song before 
 Oh no, can't get enough 
 Can't get enough, no I can't get enough 
 Oh no, can't get enough 
 Can't get enough, no I can't get enough 
 No I can't get enough, no I can't get enough 
 Well you're feeling so fit 
 Since you're starting the car 
 You're so full of my biz 
 And you just love to jar 
 Could your baby look sick 
 And she don't wanna speak? 
 Could you don't seem to care 
 Again of the week? 
 You're a Friday night 
 You and your baby feel alright? 
 Oh Lord, I heard that song before 
 Oh no, can't get enough 
 Can't get enough, no I can't get enough 
 Oh no, can't get enough 
 Can't get enough, no I can't get enough 
 No I can't get enough, no I can't get enough 
 (You're a Friday waiting for a man) 
 (You're a Friday waiting for a man) 
 Well you draw out again 
 And you fall on your back 
 Got a pain in your head 
 Got your foot in your hat 
 And you look in the glass 
 And it don't look like you 
 And your hands start to shake 
 For what can you do? 
 This is Friday night 
 Got no baby, don't seem right 
 Oh Lord, I heard that song before 
 Oh no, can't get enough 
 Can't get enough, no I can't get enough 
 Oh no, can't get enough 
 Can't get enough, no I can't get enough 
 No I can't get enough, no I can't get enough 
 No I can't get enough, no I can't get enough 
 No I can't get enough, no I can't get enough 
 No I can't get enough, no I can't get enough 
 No I can't get enough, no I can't get enough 
 No I can't get enough, no I can't get enough
