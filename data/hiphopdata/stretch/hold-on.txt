Hold on mama, don't make no plans 
 You might be wasting your time 
 And though I know you've been good to me 
 There's lots of places I gotta see 
 Hold on, can't let myself get started 
 I'll end up broken-hearted 
 I'll say hello and then I'll blow 
 Hold on 
 Hold on mama, don't count me in 
 I can't count on myself 
 I feel those ropes start taking hold 
 I know it's time I hit that road 
 Hold on, can't let myself get started 
 I'll end up broken-hearted 
 I'll say hello and then I'll blow 
 Hold on 
 Hold on mama, don't make no plans 
 You might be wasting your time 
 And though I know you've been good to me 
 There's lots of places I gotta see 
 Hold on, can't let myself get started 
 I'll end up broken-hearted 
 I'll say hello and then I'll blow
