You don't know what's going on 
 Out on the streets you think I'm having fun 
 Dodging the heat or to make a dime 
 And good friends in mind, a dooming time 
 You ain't careful bout what you say 
 You think you're cool but you got no strength 
 You're just a fool who puts me over the line 
 And good friends in mind, a dooming time 
 If the cap fits you will know more 
 You ain't got a friend, you don't choose 
 And while you're counting your money 
 I'm singing the blues 
 You're so quick to shout your name 
 You are respect but you got no shame 
 Probing a neat boy to put your sign 
 And good friends in mind, a dooming time 
 You shake hands with your palms up 
 Watching you make it just crack 
 And while you're chasing the blowie 
 I'm paying the time 
 You don't know what's going on 
 Out on the streets you think I'm having fun 
 Dodging the heat or to make a dime 
 And good friends in mind, a dooming time 
 If the cap fits you will know more 
 You ain't got a friend, you don't choose 
 And while you're counting your money 
 I'm singing the blues
