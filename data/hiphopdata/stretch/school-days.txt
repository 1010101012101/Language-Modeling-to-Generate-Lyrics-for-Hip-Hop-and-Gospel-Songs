What's that one more time I knew 
 What to say and what to do? 
 Standing in the bathroom 
 With an answer in my head 
 Never ever breaking 
 What could happen to a fool who wouldn't 
 Listen to the things they've said 
 For thinking for myself? 
 School days, school days 
 Never let them tell you 
 That they were just the good days 
 Bad days were all I've found 
 School days, school days 
 Never had the chance 
 To be anything but that way 
 School days are better gone 
 What you see and what you hear 
 Is clouded by a use of fear 
 Never ask your questions 
 That don't fit in too damn well 
 You're pretending you don't notice 
 All the things they do to keep you feeling 
 Dim savior and so I'm sure 
 Of thinking for yourself 
 School days, school days 
 Never let them tell you 
 That they were just the good days 
 Bad days were all I've found 
 School days, school days 
 Never had the chance 
 To be anything but that way 
 School days are better gone 
 Can you tell me what you're doing? 
 Can you tell me what you're thinking? 
 Will you let me know what you are feeling? 
 I can tell you what I see 
 Nothing you can say will ever hurt me 
 All you ever wanted was to see me 
 Don't give it into pressure from your dealing 
 I can tell you what I see 
 Can you tell me what you're doing? 
 Can you tell me what you're thinking? 
 Will you let me know what you are feeling? 
 I can tell you what I see
