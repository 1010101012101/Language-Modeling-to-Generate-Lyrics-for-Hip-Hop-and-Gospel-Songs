I couldn't stop moving when it first took hold 
 Was a balling night at the old town hall 
 There's a band called The Jokers, they were laying it down 
 And you know I'm never gonna lose the funky sound 
 Rock 'N' Roll Hoochie-Coo 
 Lawdy mama light my fuse 
 Rock 'N' Roll Hoochie-Coo 
 Strut on down and spread the news, yeah 
 I hope you all know what I'm talking about 
 It's a really good thing that makes me jump and shout 
 Gets me all the time, but if you ain't there too 
 Just come a little closer and I'll do it to you, yeah 
 Rock 'N' Roll Hoochie-Coo 
 Lawdy mama light my fuse 
 Rock 'N' Roll Hoochie-Coo 
 Strut on down and spread the news, yeah, strut on 
 This crazy starts bucking 'bout the time of year 
 Just going round back, gonna meet me there 
 We'll roll in the grass growing behind the barn 
 Then my ears start ringing like a fire alarm, yeah 
 Rock 'N' Roll Hoochie-Coo 
 Lawdy mama light my fuse 
 Rock 'N' Roll Hoochie-Coo 
 Strut on down and spread the news, yeah 
 Rock 'N' Roll Hoochie-Coo 
 Lawdy mama light my fuse 
 Rock 'N' Roll Hoochie-Coo 
 Strut on down and spread the news 
 Sure got tired of paying dues 
 Said goodbye to all my blues 
 Lawdy mama light my fuse
