You can sprinkle stardust in her silky hair 
 Flowing down giggly seas when the crowd is there 
 Don't you know she can't make it? 
 Can't fake it, she's so square, yeah, yeah 
 Nervous introduction ain't too tantalized 
 Hollywood production keeps them mesmerized 
 Don't you know she don't like it? 
 Can't fight, she's hypnotized 
 Because Miss Dizzy does not see what's happening 
 She's just the product of the Big Seagull 
 She thinks her public can't go on without her 
 She's going to be a star 
 Because Miss Dizzy does not see what's happening 
 She's just the product of the Big Seagull 
 She thinks her public can't go on without her 
 She's going to be a star 
 Harlequin impersonating Columbine 
 Spinning in the lights, oh doesn't she look fine? 
 Don't you know she can't take this? 
 Can't make this pantomime
