I didn't think that I would care 
 I didn't know how much she meant to me 
 Now I go home and she's not there 
 And all I feel is empty 
 She was the one thing in my life 
 But I'm dreaming her own kind 
 Now it cuts me like a knife 
 Just can't get her off my mind 
 But tomorrow's another day 
 For taking my blues away 
 For taking my blues away 
 Just like it was before 
 See her face come through the door tomorrow 
 The one you love's the one you hurt the most 
 I've heard it said so many times before 
 But since you left me babe, I'm lost 
 And I can't take no more 
 But tomorrow's another day 
 For taking my blues away 
 For taking my blues away 
 Just like it was before 
 See her face come through the door tomorrow 
 I didn't think that I would care 
 I didn't know how much she meant to me 
 Now I go home and she's not there 
 And all I feel is empty 
 But tomorrow's another day 
 For taking my blues away 
 For taking my blues away 
 Just like it was before 
 See her face come through the door tomorrow 
 Today
