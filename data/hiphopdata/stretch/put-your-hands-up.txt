Put your hands up 
 All you people like to do the boogie-woogie 
 Won't you stand up? 
 All you people like to do the boogie-woogie 
 Well I like to see you, people 
 Kicking up a beat 
 Rising to your feet 
 To generate a little heat now, people 
 Listen to me 
 You ever seen my baby? 
 She looks so tasty when she do the boogie-woogie 
 She ain't no lady 
 Drives men crazy when she do the boogie-woogie 
 She's crouched behind you, people 
 Then entertain the wife 
 Trying like them she may 
 She'll sure keep all that stuff for a night now, baby 
 Listen to me 
 Put your hands up 
 All you people like to do the boogie-woogie 
 Won't you stand up? 
 All you people like to do the boogie-woogie 
 I like to see you, people 
 Kicking up a beat 
 Rising to your feet 
 To generate a little heat now, people 
 Listen to me
