How many times must I tell you 
 That I can't go on this way? 
 Believing all you say and seeing nothing 
 And you don't want to listen 
 Can't you hear me when I say 
 That everything we've got depends on what you do today? 
 Time will not heal these wounds that you reel 
 And no one else but us will end up crying 
 I can see you don't believe me 
 But I'm telling you the truth 
 'Cause I've seen so many others come and go 
 It's time to stop and think, my friend 
 Of others but yourself 
 And pay back all those people you've been owing 
 Time will not heal these wounds that you reel 
 And no one else but us will end up crying 
 If I stood up and told you 
 The truth right to your face 
 Could you ever understand my point of view? 
 Or would you simply tell me 
 That you knew that you were right 
 And I've betrayed your trust with all my scheming? 
 Time will not heal these wounds that you reel 
 And no one else but us will end up crying 
 And you will realize that I ain't lying 
 When I say no one else but us will end up crying
