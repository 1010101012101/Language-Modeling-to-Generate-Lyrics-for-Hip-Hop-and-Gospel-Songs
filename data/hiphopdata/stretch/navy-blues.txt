See you every morning 
 Walking down the street 
 You look so young and beautiful 
 Good enough to eat 
 I knew that you know that I knew 
 You looked at me, I saw you 
 Despite all the stones you threw 
 I got the navy blues 
 You talk of sociology 
 Like it was some kind of fun 
 Talking bout your history 
 Like it had just begun 
 I know what you're blowing through (Really) 
 Don't forget that I've been there too 
 They drilled it right through and through 
 Now give me the navy blues 
 You were just a schoolgirl 
 I'm a working man 
 We can find some kinda compromise 
 I'm really sure we can 
 So come on and sit on my knee 
 Forget all that ABC 
 I'll teach you to learn what you need 
 Make you really wanna scream 
 (But you only keep buying that bulljunk)
