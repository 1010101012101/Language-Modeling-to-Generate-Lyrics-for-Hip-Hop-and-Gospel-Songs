Oh no, snakes alive 
 You ain't done nothing since where they did the hand jive 
 Full well, seems to me 
 You can't do nothing yet 
 You're rolling down from London Town 
 Take a look and then turn around 
 We're the ones, try to make this sound 
 But you can't do nothing yet 
 We're tired, ain't going out, got no food 
 And we can't get none till we get our soul 
 Oh well, seems to me 
 You can't do nothing yet 
 Hey man, what you trying to say? 
 Stick it out if we're gonna make a Sunday 
 Till then, gonna make a runaway 
 But you can't do nothing yet 
 Oh you ain't got a dime 
 But get a job and write music in the spare time 
 One day everything'll be fine 
 But you can't do nothing yet 
 We're tired, ain't going out, got no food 
 And we can't get none till we get our soul 
 Oh well, seems to me 
 You can't do nothing yet 
 Oh you ain't got a dime 
 But get a job and write music in the spare time 
 One day everything'll be fine 
 But you can't do nothing yet 
 Oh no, snakes alive 
 You ain't done nothing since where they did the hand jive 
 Full well, seems to me 
 You can't do nothing yet 
 We're tired, ain't going out, got no food 
 And we can't get none till we get our soul 
 Oh well, seems to me 
 You can't do nothing yet
