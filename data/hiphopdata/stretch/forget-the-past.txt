Wishing you were here to be the friend that I once knew 
 All the feelings I have shown you seem to be so true 
 Every mother's son can see the shell begin to crack 
 Torn between the years of giving in and fighting back 
 Just forget the past for the shadow's cast 
 By the reason for will soon be gone 
 And the one you choose will carry on 
 On and on you go to find a place for what you do 
 Chances that you miss will never be the same for you 
 Everything you see becomes a thing of days gone by 
 Sticking to the bottom, don't disturb them as a lie 
 Just forget the past for the shadow's cast 
 By the reason for will soon be gone 
 And the one you choose will carry on 
 Just forget the past for the shadow's cast 
 By the reason for will soon be gone 
 And the one you choose will carry on
