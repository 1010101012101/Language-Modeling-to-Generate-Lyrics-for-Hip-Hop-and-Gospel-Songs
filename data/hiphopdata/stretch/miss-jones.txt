Oh you pretty thing now 
 Won't you come and stay with me? 
 Bring on sunshine and then 
 Close the door and stay with me 
 I've been on the road so far from home 
 Playing Rock and Roll 
 Got no place to go and I like your soul 
 Won't you kindly lay your head down low? 
 Miss Jones, you're a woman down the rocking road 
 Oh you pretty thing now 
 Won't you come and lay me down? 
 Each tomorrow brings 
 Another show, another town 
 I've been on the road so far from home 
 Playing Rock and Roll 
 Days of planes and cars and hotel bars 
 I don't wanna spend the nights alone 
 Miss Jones, you're a woman down the rocking road 
 Oh you pretty thing now 
 Won't you come and lay me down? 
 Each tomorrow brings 
 Another show, another town 
 I've been on the road so far from home 
 Playing Rock and Roll 
 Got no place to go and I like your soul 
 Won't you kindly lay your head down low? 
 Miss Jones, you're a woman down the rocking road 
 Miss Jones, you're a woman down the rocking road 
 Miss Jones, you're a woman down the rocking road 
 You're a woman on the rocking road 
 Woman on the rocking road
