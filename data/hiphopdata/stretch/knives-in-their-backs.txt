Time is money and money is time 
 You know they keep on giving you, giving you the same old line 
 The man at the barroom mustn't get to the top 
 Well he's got the embouchure, he ain't gonna stop 
 Well he was fifteen years when he left the school 
 And he started, started on the social climb 
 By the time he was twenty, he sure done, friend 
 And so he got a wife, got a wife to pass the time 
 He's got everything that he needs 
 There ain't nothing that he lacks 
 He says "You've gotta screw everyone 
 When leaving knives in their backs"
