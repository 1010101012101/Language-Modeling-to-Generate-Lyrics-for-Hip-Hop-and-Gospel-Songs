Well I can't believe you do it 
 But you say you will improve it 
 It's been happening all the time 
 There's been rights and wrongs in bold sight 
 And the nights and days are white lies 
 Just making such a crime 
 Ain't got no reason loving you 
 Ain't got no reason loving you 
 Oh, loving you 
 Loving you, yeah, loving you 
 You convince yourself you're changing 
 But you talk about the same things 
 It's always on your mind 
 I can see just what you're trying 
 But it won't work when you're lying 
 You'll never change your kind 
 Ain't got no reason loving you 
 Ain't got no reason loving you 
 Ain't got no reason loving you 
 Ain't got no reason 
 Ain't got no reason 
 Ain't got no reason 
 Ain't got no reason loving you 
 Ain't got no reason 
 Ain't got no reason 
 Ain't got no reason 
 Ain't got no reason loving you 
 Ain't got no reason 
 Ain't got no reason loving you
