Well you can beat on a toad 
 Till your face turn to red 
 You can boogie all night 
 You can lay in bed 
 You can cruise in your car 
 You can watch TV 
 You can act like a star 
 You can act like me 
 But you can't, no you can't 
 No you can't, no you can't 
 Well you can't beat your brain for entertainment 
 If you got food in your belly 
 And a place to stay 
 With someone you love 
 The rest is luxury 
 Got your friends, all a joy 
 But you just can't buy 
 That's why poor men are happy 
 While rich men cry 
 'Cause you can't, no you can't 
 No you can't, no you can't 
 Well you can't beat your brain for entertainment 
 Right 
 Well you can't own the sun 
 And you can't stop the rain 
 Though you might have a nature 
 You still feel pain 
 So it don't really matter 
 If you got no dough 
 The folks who are lucky 
 Are the ones who would know 
 That you can't, no you can't 
 No you can't, no you can't 
 Well you can't beat your brain for entertainment 
 For entertainment 
 For entertainment 
 For entertainment
