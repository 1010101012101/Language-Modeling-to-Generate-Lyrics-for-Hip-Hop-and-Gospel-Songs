I'll tell the story 
 Just once again 
 The way I love you baby 
 Darling, it's a sin 
 You broke my heart once before 
 And now you're trying to break it again 
 I was in Korea 
 About '51 
 Didn't have no loving baby 
 And that was no home 
 I would send you all my money baby 
 And all the time you were doing me wrong 
 If you had to go 
 Why didn't you let me know? 
 I could've found someone else in town 
 But since you're gone 
 I just can't carry on 
 You've got me going out of my mind, yeah baby 
 Why don't you come back fast? 
 Without you baby 
 I just cannot last 
 Come on over, come on over baby 
 Bring your sweet loving home to me 
 Home 
 If you had to go 
 Why didn't you let me know? 
 I could've found someone else in town, oh-oh 
 But since you're gone 
 I just can't carry on 
 You've got me going out of my mind, yeah baby 
 Why don't you come back fast? 
 Without you baby 
 I just cannot last 
 Come on over baby 
 Bring your loving home to me 
 Bring your loving home to me 
 Bring that on home
