I said "Doctor, please help me 
 I've got some trouble with my heart" 
 He said "Son, don't you worry 
 I think it's just the start 
 Because love got a hold on you" 
 He said "Love got a hold on you" 
 Some quacks will tell you 
 "We've got a cure for this 
 We've got the cure, you've got the money" 
 There ain't a trick, the thing is 
 Because love got a hold on you 
 Because love got a hold on you 
 Got a hold on you 
 I don't care 'bout the money 
 Can't you ease the pain? 
 I feel my spirit is sinking 
 Never be the same again 
 Because love got a hold on me 
 Yeah love got a hold on me 
 Got a hold on me 
 I said "Doctor, please help me 
 I've got some trouble with my heart" 
 He said "Son, don't you worry 
 I think it's just the start 
 Because love got a hold on you" 
 He said "Love got a hold on you" 
 He said "Listen, I'll tell you 
 There's nothing I can do 
 I don't like to admit it 
 I'm infected too 
 'Cause love got a hold on me 
 Said love got a hold on me 
 Got a hold on me"
