Hotel inn and a great big city 
 Tried to keep the world away from my door 
 Got so down, started wondering what life was for 
 When I met up with a good time lady 
 She taught me how to spend my dough 
 It's all gone now but I ain't alone no more 
 Hold up the light 
 Don't believe in life do you? 
 Hold up the light 
 She was happening to you 
 No more worry in my tomorrowland 
 Fancy girls, take advantage of me 
 You say that's crazy, well that's how I want it to be 
 Hold up the light 
 Don't believe in life do you? 
 Hold up the light 
 She was happening to you 
 Spend my time and I'll spend my money 
 Gonna keep on living it high off the hog 
 'Cause when I'm gone, boys, I ain't coming back no more 
 Hold up the light 
 Don't believe in life do you? 
 Hold up the light 
 She was happening to you
