Well tell me anybody 
 Do you really give a damn for me? 
 Well tell me anybody 
 Do you really give a damn for me? 
 'Cause I just got to tell you 
 About a little thing been worrying me 
 I was a rambling pony 
 I would roam from town to town 
 I was a rambling pony 
 I would roam, I would roam 
 I would roam from town to town 
 Just looking for a sweet woman 
 Looking for a sweet woman 
 And making my own love just come on down 
 If I needed anybody 
 Baby I would take you home with me 
 If I needed anybody 
 Baby I would take you, baby I would shake you 
 Baby I would take you home with me 
 But I don't need nobody 
 I don't need anybody, don't need anybody 
 Don't need anybody, just him and me 
 And you're sitting there so green 
 Believe me man I'm just the same as you 
 And you're sitting there so green 
 Believe me man I'm just the same as you 
 You want me to make you laugh, cry or dissatisfied? 
 You want me to make you laugh, cry or dissatisfied? 
 That's exactly what I mean to do
