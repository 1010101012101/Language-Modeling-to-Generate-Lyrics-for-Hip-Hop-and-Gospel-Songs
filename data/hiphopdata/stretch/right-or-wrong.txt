This is the story 'bout a boy from out of town 
 Who learned his lessons 
 From the things he's seen going down 
 Sometimes he feels so tired and worn 
 Sometimes he feels like he's just been born 
 But mostly he just keeps rolling on 
 Singing his song, right or wrong 
 Well it's a long long way 
 From the bottom of the ladder to the top 
 But in you that once he started 
 Then there just was no way he'd ever stop 
 Chuck Berry records and a cheap guitar 
 The slightest chance that he could go far 
 The praise that kept him rolling on 
 Singing his song, right or wrong 
 And when he wonders what it's all about 
 He's got his friends to help him work it out 
 He's got his friends and there's nowhere 
 To wanna walk him real bad 
 And all those people who just put him down 
 They'll realize exactly what he's found 
 He's got his friends and there's nowhere 
 To wanna walk him real bad 
 Well it's a long long way 
 From the bottom of the ladder to the top 
 But in you that once he started 
 Then there just was no way he'd ever stop 
 Sometimes he feels so tired and worn 
 Sometimes he feels like he's just been born 
 But mostly he just keeps rolling on 
 Singing his song, right or wrong 
 And when he wonders what it's all about 
 He's got his friends to help him work it out 
 He's got his friends and there's nowhere 
 To wanna walk him real bad 
 And all those people who just put him down 
 They'll realize exactly what he's found 
 He's got his friends and there's nowhere 
 To wanna walk him real bad
