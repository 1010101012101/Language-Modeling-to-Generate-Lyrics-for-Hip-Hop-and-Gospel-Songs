Feel it's time to move my bones 
 Miss the summer nights back home 
 The moon like a lantern hanging in a big old tree 
 My ol' lady taking the mischief out of me 
 Friends I'm sure can't see me now 
 When I hit that old home town 
 I'm sat in the backyard sipping on a jug o' dew 
 My ol' lady taking the things that make me blue 
 Lord, I've never been one to sit still long 
 I've got to move on, Lord 
 I've been in a lot of places 
 Ain't no place like home sweet home 
 The moon like a lantern hanging in a big old tree 
 My ol' lady taking the mischief out of me 
 Lord, I've never been one to sit still long 
 I've got to move on, Lord 
 I've been in a lot of places 
 Ain't no place like home sweet home 
 The moon like a lantern hanging in a big old tree 
 My ol' lady taking the mischief out of me 
 So let the sun shine down on me 
 Lady, you're peaceful as can be 
 The world in my pocket mellow as a lizard's eye 
 My ol' lady taking the troubles off my mind
