I've got a feeling like I never had before 
 I've got a feeling, it's like "Hope I knock the door" 
 I've got a feeling and it's telling me this hour 
 Time is on my side and my musing everyone 
 Even in my darkest moments 
 I can find the strength in me 
 So all you jokers better watch out 
 If you think that you're fooling me 
 There was a time when you walked right through the door 
 That was before you wanted so much more 
 And now I think that your time is almost done 
 Too bad you know how a thing like this will go 
 Even in my darkest moments 
 I can find the strength in me 
 So all you jokers better watch out 
 If you think that you're fooling me
