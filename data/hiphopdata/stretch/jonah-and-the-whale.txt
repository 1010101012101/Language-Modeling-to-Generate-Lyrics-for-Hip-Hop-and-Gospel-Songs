I don't wanna take your money 
 I don't wanna steal your car 
 Guess you think it's kind of funny 
 That I like you just the way you are 
 Take me where you wanna take me 
 Lead me where you wanna go 
 But don't pretend you never knew me 
 I don't need the kinda bullshit show 
 You never saw me stand in anybody's way 
 Like a man with a million I never have to pay 
 'Cause you never saw me doing what I do today 
 And just like Jonah I'm in the whale 
 Swear I saw you looking hungry 
 In a place, the other side of town 
 You said I've been very lucky 
 That I've never really been down 
 Take a pence, take a penny 
 Never let 'em go 
 But don't pretend you never knew me 
 I don't need the kinda bullshit show 
 You never saw me stand in anybody's way 
 Like a man with a million I never have to pay 
 'Cause you never saw me doing what I do today 
 And just like Jonah I'm in the whale 
 I don't wanna take your money 
 I don't wanna steal your car 
 Guess you think it's kind of funny 
 That I like you just the way you are 
 Take me where you wanna take me 
 Lead me where you wanna go 
 But don't pretend you never knew me 
 I don't need the kinda bullshit show 
 You never saw me stand in anybody's way 
 Like a man with a million I never have to pay 
 'Cause you never saw me doing what I do today 
 And just like Jonah I'm in the whale
