It was cold, it was wet in the dark side of town 
 The kind of day that can bring you down 
 Streets were deserted, not a soul in sight 
 I still felt worried 'bout the previous night 
 I wondered what you might be thinking in your bed so wrong? 
 Did you dream of what would be a shelter from the storm? 
 I done some talking, I done some thinking 
 I tried to find out what we do with this way 
 And for my troubles all I've discovered 
 Is when you borrow them you've got to repay 
 Could it be that we've made a mistake and it just ain't right? 
 We act like people who pretend that they're blind but in my insight 
 Take me away from this wasteland Brighton 
 'Cause it's not something they all wanna do 
 Take me away every piece of Brighton 
 It must be 'bout you 
 I done some talking, I done some thinking 
 I tried to find out what we do with this way 
 And for my troubles all I've discovered 
 Is when you borrow them you've got to repay 
 Could it be that we've made a mistake and it just ain't right? 
 We act like people who pretend that they're blind but in my insight 
 Take me away from this wasteland Brighton 
 'Cause it's not something they all wanna do 
 Take me away every piece of Brighton 
 I wanna be where I can speak some truth 
 Take me away 
 Take me away
