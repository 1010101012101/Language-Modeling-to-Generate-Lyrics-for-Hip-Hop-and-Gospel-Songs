Sitting in the high beams, we're getting quiet Lord 
 I need some scenery 
 Stepped out on the door, chicks in a car 
 Are rolling down the window and said "What's happening?" 
 Oh Lord, what could I say? 
 I'm a poor poor boy a long way from his home, oh 
 They showed me some sights that I'd never seen before 
 Seems that ain't the lady, well that's the way the wind blows 
 Me and Kirby and a bottle of Bourbon 
 Listening to the riffing play 
 A chick walks in with a key and her friends 
 Says "I've got you on the night and my place is this way" 
 Oh Lord, what could we do? 
 It's a poor poor vice and all this is so new 
 Done a lot of things that we never could've dreamed of 
 Seems that it all ends, well that's the way the wind blows 
 Stepping off a plane and hopping in the rain 
 I was thinking 'bout the Banjo Man 
 Till I'm off, never can fuss from this teenage lust 
 That's with a body that was built for hot great action 
 Oh child, take it away 
 Must be part of your plan and baby that's-a okay, yeah 
 Don't they got a girl and a Rock and Roll hobo? 
 Seems anywhere I go, well that's the way the wind blows 
 That's the way the wind blows 
 That's the way the wind blows 
 That's the way the wind blows 
 That's the way the wind blows 
 That's the way the wind blows 
 That's the way the wind blows 
 That's the way the wind blows 
 That's the way the wind blows
