Things are getting heavy 
 They're getting worse each day 
 Time for us to leave now 
 Slip away 
 I know it won't be easy 
 Promises you made 
 But you can't live forever 
 Slip away 
 The time will come to worry 
 It gets you in the end 
 But you win, I can't leave it, little friend 
 (So sad my friend) 
 The city doesn't love you 
 It fills your life with lies 
 And like a game you leave them to survive 
 Things are getting heavy 
 They're getting worse each day 
 Time for us to leave now 
 Slip away, slip away, slip away, slip away
