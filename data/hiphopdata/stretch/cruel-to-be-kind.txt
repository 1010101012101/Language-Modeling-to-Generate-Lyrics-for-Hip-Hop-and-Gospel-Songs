Who do we have to be? 
 Cruel to be kind and free 
 There must be a way we can be friends 
 But the problem that you see 
 Has a strange effect on me 
 Sometimes it can really bring me down 
 Can't you see what it's doing to me? 
 I don't wanna be the one to bring you down 
 There's a chance for you and me 
 And I think that you're to bring 
 If we don't take it someone else sure will 
 But at least we got some trust 
 In a laugh that says we must 
 Always fight to keep ourselves alive 
 Can't you see what it's doing to me? 
 I don't wanna be the one to bring you down 
 Can't you see what it's doing to me? 
 I don't wanna be the one to bring you down
