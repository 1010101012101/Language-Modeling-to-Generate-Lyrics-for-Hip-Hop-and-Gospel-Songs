Buzz fly, buzz fly 
 Where do you go in summertime? 
 Where do you go when summer's gone? 
 Where do you go when the winter's long? 
 Buzz buzz, buzz buzz 
 I buzz the timer all day long 
 I lay me down for the summer's gone 
 I'm down and falling, winter comes 
 Buzz fly, buzz fly 
 Why don't you care that you might die? 
 Don't you worry when summer's gone 
 You'll feel the winter coming on 
 Buzz buzz, buzz buzz 
 My shogun warrior fashion fair 
 By summer all my work is done 
 I'm glad to go when winter comes
