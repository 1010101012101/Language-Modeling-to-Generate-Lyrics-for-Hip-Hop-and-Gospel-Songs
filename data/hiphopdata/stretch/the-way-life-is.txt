He stands on the street, not a penny to his name 
 People pass him by, they say he's got himself to blame 
 But do they know what it's like when you lose everything? 
 They only wanna know you when you win 
 He's found out the way life is 
 And it's only time before it happens to you 
 He's found out but it's too late 
 I hope it's not too late for you 
 He used to be so proud of his philosophy 
 He didn't want to live a life of mediocrity 
 I didn't think he would be treated like he was 
 And now you see him hang his head because 
 He's found out the way life is 
 And it's only time before it happens to you 
 He's found out but it's too late 
 I hope it's not too late for you 
 He stands on the street, not a penny to his name 
 People pass him by, they say he's got himself to blame 
 But do they know what it's like when you lose everything? 
 They only wanna know you when you win 
 He's found out the way life is 
 And it's only time before it happens to you 
 He's found out but it's too late 
 I hope it's not too late for you
