If the sun was a lover 
 What a lover he could be 
 He could fly you through the air 
 Take you swimming in the sea 
 He's a man of potential 
 There ain't no one he can't fend 
 And he's coming just to take you 
 Where you'll really need a friend 
 Take you down 
 He's gonna show you around 
 He's gonna take you down 
 Well the name of his game 
 Is a favour for his friends 
 God he follows that he borrow's 
 Just as easy as he lends 
 So don't you worry 'bout him, dear 
 At the station for his train 
 'Cause he's coming just to take you 
 Where you'll really need a friend 
 Take you down 
 He's gonna show you around 
 He's gonna take you down 
 If the sun was a lover 
 What a lover he could be 
 He could fly you through the air 
 Take you swimming in the sea 
 He's a man of potential 
 There ain't no one he can't fend 
 And he's coming just to take you 
 Where you'll really need a friend 
 Take you down 
 He's gonna show you around 
 He's gonna take you down 
 He's gonna take you down 
 He's gonna take you down
