I'm looking fooled in my mind, Lord 
 I believe I'm fixing to die 
 I'm looking fooled in my mind, Lord 
 I believe I'm fixing to die 
 Well, I ain't scared of dying 
 But I hate to leave my children crying 
 So many nights by the fireside 
 I heard my children's mama cry 
 So many nights by the fireside 
 I heard my children's mama cry 
 That's why I've tried so hard, children 
 To come home to die 
 Your mama treated me, children 
 Like I was her baby child 
 Your mama treated me, children 
 Like I was her baby child 
 That's why I just could not tell her 
 I had to say goodbye 
 Oh take my children back before 
 Before they lay me down 
 Oh take my children back before 
 Before they lay me down 
 Don't leave them standing 
 On that burying ground 
 I'm looking fooled in my mind, Lord 
 I believe I'm fixing to die 
 I'm looking fooled in my mind, Lord 
 I believe I'm fixing to die 
 Well, I ain't scared of dying 
 But I hate to leave my children crying 
 Well, I ain't scared of dying 
 But I hate to leave my children crying 
 Well, I ain't scared of dying 
 But I hate to leave my children crying
