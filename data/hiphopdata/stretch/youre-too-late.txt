Are you reading your lies you got from another? 
 You can't stop the words, you can't lose your cover 
 You twist and you turn, I see what you're doing 
 Watching your every move, who'd you think you've been fooling? 
 It's too late now, it's too late 
 Ooh, they tell you it's too late 
 It's too late now, it's too late 
 Ooh, maybe give you some time to breath 
 They smile on your face to tell you're choking 
 People ain't sure if it's real or you're joking 
 What can you do to make things easy? 
 Nothing inside of you like to make an impression 
 It's too late now, it's too late 
 Ooh, they tell you it's too late 
 It's too late now, it's too late 
 Ooh, maybe give you some time to breath 
 Showing them just where you're going 
 You give them a taste of a keeper's roar 
 Hold yourself and get them on your side 
 You're hurting them the same as you 
 You won't do much with that point of view 
 Can't you see you're growing? 
 Changing your mind, you can't stop running 
 Leave 'em behind, still keep coming 
 For in this room it feels like a million 
 Always too many around when you're tired of preaching 
 It's too late now, it's too late 
 Ooh, they tell you it's too late 
 It's too late now, it's too late 
 Ooh, maybe give you some time to breath 
 Ooh, maybe it's too late 
 Ooh, maybe it's too late 
 Ooh, maybe it's too late 
 Ooh, maybe it's too late 
 Ooh, maybe it's too late 
 (Too late, too late, too late, too late) 
 Ooh, maybe it's too late 
 (Too late, too late, too late, too late) 
 (Too late, too late, too late, too late) 
 Ooh, maybe it's too late 
 (Too late, too late) 
 Ooh, maybe it's too late
