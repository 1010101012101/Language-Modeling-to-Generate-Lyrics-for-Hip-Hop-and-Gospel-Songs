 Everyday, day I hustle, everyday I'm getting money 
 If her pussy good then everyday I'm spending money 
 Throw it in the bag, throw it in the bag 
 I ain't got credit, but your dog got cash 
 Money money money, stay out of my lane 
 Your team running laps, my team run the game 
 This is America, ain't shit free? 
 I need my money tall, at least 6'3" 
 Blacka, blacka, blacka, money money money

 Wake up in the morning, take a money shower 
 Now I'm smelling like money, got the money and the power 
 Bad boy money, Martin and Will 
 My face good money, they should put me on the bill 
 I pioneered the jets and the yachts and the shoppers 
 Crushing model chicks, throwing minks on the toddlers 
 NASDAQ money, Dow Jones, homes 
 Money money money, motherfucker, daddy's home 
 Cash Money, Young Money, Bad Boy Money 
 Shorty says a boss never throw toy money 
 So, blah, blah, motherfucker I'm ill 
 Make that thing bounce for these hundred dollar bills 
 Now I'm getting money, I ball 
 I remember I had no money at all 
 Now I'm so shallow, name brand apparel 
 I'm in that new, new, everyday wanna battle 
 Blacka, blacka, blacka, money money money 
 Any given day I'm pouring honey on your honey 
 And I murder everybody, okay everybody, say it

 Clap for that money like the booty on a shorty then 
 Y'all just keep clapping, studio audience 
 Told her stretch it out like she doin' an accordion 
 And bust it, bust it, bust it like she snuck a Glock .40 in 
 Daddy gon' show you bitches how bein' spoiled feel 
 I got millions of ways, young oil field 
 Married to the money, faithful to the millions 
 Got my money up, safe is in the ceiling
