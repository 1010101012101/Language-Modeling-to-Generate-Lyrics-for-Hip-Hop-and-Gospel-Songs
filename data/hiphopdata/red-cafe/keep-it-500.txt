Champaigne wishes, scarface pictures 
 Cocaine stain's on my grandmamma dishes 
 Choke out snitche's, pay off po-po 
 I be in the A, dippin' on the low low 
 Wit my down girl she a outta town girl 
 Always bring home girls so I keep a round girl 
 Huh, how you love that whoa 
 Shine like flash at a Kodak show 
 Bangkok dirty, rap game killer 
 Wifey burglar that's me same nigger 
 Arm and Hammer man, kiss to the sky 
 B.I.G. I'll soon come keep a bitch on the side 
 I'm'a keep it 500 (I'm'a keep it 500) 
 I'm'a keep it 500 (I'm'a keep it 500) 
 I'm'a keep it 500 (I'm'a keep it 500) 
 From the East to the West 
 To the South I run it 
 I'm'a keep it 500 (I'm'a keep it 500) 
 I'm'a keep it 500 (I'm'a keep it 500) 
 I'm'a keep it 500 (I'm'a keep it 500) 
 From the North to the South 
 To the East I run it 
 Bitches so perfect, two thumbs up 
 Brooklyn's yo symity, two guns up 
 Shake down on the set, who the fuck want what 
 Money money money give a G that rush 
 What you know about burkin', 
 You lames joggin', my dawgs surfin' 
 My squad eatin', all day burpin' 
 Whip game wizard in the kitchen I'm Merlin 
 I'm the raviolli, with the four cheeses 
 Air max holder, no more visa's 
 Floor seats at the game I never seen bleechers 
 Pants sag low still attracting all divas 
 I'm'a keep it 500 (I'm'a keep it 500) 
 I'm'a keep it 500 (I'm'a keep it 500) 
 I'm'a keep it 500 (I'm'a keep it 500) 
 From the East to the West 
 To the South I run it 
 I'm'a keep it 500 (I'm'a keep it 500) 
 I'm'a keep it 500 (I'm'a keep it 500) 
 I'm'a keep it 500 (I'm'a keep it 500) 
 From the North to the South 
 To the East I run it 
 Penthouse dreams turn to penthouse scenes 
 R&B chicks hoppin' out the Bent mean 
 Yeah bringing work to D.C 
 Same nigga from the tent I'm in apartment 3C 
 Hood certified, bin a bad boy 
 Keepin' up with the jones', Junior ask Roy 
 And I got G-Pala at me for the twerk 
 I'm'a bring the city back like it's in re 
 Bossed up moves, back seat rider 
 Pokerface on where the fuck is lady Gaga 
 Flights to the West, mac dime on my cheque 
 On that Brooklyn bullshit, no lying on my tat's 
 I'm'a keep it 500 (I'm'a keep it 500) 
 I'm'a keep it 500 (I'm'a keep it 500) 
 I'm'a keep it 500 (I'm'a keep it 500) 
 From the East to the West 
 To the South I run it 
 I'm'a keep it 500 (I'm'a keep it 500) 
 I'm'a keep it 500 (I'm'a keep it 500) 
 I'm'a keep it 500 (I'm'a keep it 500) 
 From the North to the South 
 To the East I run it
