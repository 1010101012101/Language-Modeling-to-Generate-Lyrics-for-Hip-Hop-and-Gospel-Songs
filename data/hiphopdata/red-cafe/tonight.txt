Jungle beats, 
 Holla at me 
 I don't know if I love ya 
 Or I just wanna fuck ya 
 Either way you're going down 
 Tonight tonight 
 Ya daddy wanna girl to go down 
 Damn I think I love her, ass so round 
 Skin so soft and her hair so long 
 First I go deep then I go long 
 Call me Machiavelli I'll be thuggin' on them hoes 
 Red bottom heals she got blood on her toes 
 I was like damn where you from what's your name 
 You the one I'm reppin' got it swingin' on the chain. 
 Seven one otro we don't do popo 
 Come to my town you can fuck with me and Loso 
 It'll go down (down, down) 
 I'm a pop a cherry way before we hit the tele' 
 Look I don't know how I fell in love so fid'ast. 
 Bet I'm gon' kill it from the back dead ass 
 Yeah I'm funeral I am on a killing spree 
 Bitches can't get in touch 
 They still feeling me 
 Always on the ichat I stay on the phone 
 They be at my neck like when I spray on cologne 
 Never said I love ya OK now come on 
 Don't listen to anything I stay on patron 
 Where is that on your own student loan collage chick 
 You can give me brain when I'm free scholarship 
 If you had me open on the head hollow tip 
 I'm a spend a couple bucks 
 God damn love sucks 
 Nice!

 If ya boss 
 I don't fuck with no clowns 
 Holla a a bitch 
 If you wanna break bead

 Juice box stay wet

 My thing bomb 
 Juice box stay wet
