So when I fly, you fly, we fly together 
 And when I shine, you shine, we shine forever, oh yeah 
 She wanna hit me on the iChat 
 On the iPad, flying to the sky, caps 
 Shorty got a nice job but works too hard 
 Put that shit off to tomorrow, now welcome to the mall 
 I need my women mogul, I make them picture mobile 
 Double MG is global, so we're of the dolo 
 I ain't rocking no polo but I'm drippin' to shine 
 Her heart beating so fast 'cause I'm taking my time 
 Yeah I get it and lick it, I just handle my business 
 As cool as a VS-1's now she knowin' the difference 
 And my Bentley just different, I keep her by my side 
 My life a runway, and it's time to fly 
 So when I fly, you fly, we fly together 
 And when I shine, you shine, we shine forever, baby 
 So when I fly, you fly, we fly together 
 And when I shine, you shine, we shine forever, oh yeah 
 I'm a boss so I need a boss chick 
 And we can play house in my fortress 
 V-kicked up corner office 
 Rob Z princess in my crosses 
 She wanna tear the mall down would I let her do 
 Give her my credit card and the debit too 
 I like your attitude, yes I'm supposed to 
 See you on facebook so I approach you 
 Biggest couple on campus 
 Stylin' on dem all ever since prom dances 
 Me and my boo, you know how I do 
 Toss keys to valet on arrival 
 We in here like a hostage 
 In my better half and that four legged ostrich 
 Hate to tell you full and through it's a blood bath 
 Swag killin' 'em hos now leave yo' autograph 
 So when I fly, you fly, we fly together 
 And when I shine, you shine, we shine forever, baby 
 So when I fly, you fly, we fly together 
 And when I shine, you shine, we shine forever, oh yeah 
 There ain't no stopping, by your side I will fly 
 Let's go house shoppin' and the one you like I will buy 
 I'll be your superhero, you'll be my Wonder Woman 
 Let's fly together 
 So when I fly, you fly, we fly together 
 And when I shine, you shine, we shine forever, baby 
 So when I fly, you fly, we fly together 
 And when I shine, you shine, we shine forever, oh yeah 
 Our cares behind we're leavin', until the sky we're reachin' 
 We will fly together, babe, we'll fly, we'll fly together, babe 
 Our cares behind we're leavin', until the sky we're reachin' 
 We will fly together, babe, we'll fly, we'll fly together 
 You are now flyin' with the best 
 If not me, then who? Your address is now cloud nine, believe that
