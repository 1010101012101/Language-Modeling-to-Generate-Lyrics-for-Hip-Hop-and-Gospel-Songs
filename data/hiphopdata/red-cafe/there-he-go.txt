 So fly (so fly), so fly (so fly), 
 You might see a nigga' if ya look up in the sky like, 
 There he go, (there he go) 
 There he go, (there he go) 
 There go that motherfucker.

 You might see me when you look up in the sky like, 
 There she go (there she go) 
 There she go (there she go)

 I'm so fly they should be me in skies 
 My sheets tight like they ain't put me in my size 
 "I already know, he gon' put me on surprise" 
 They gon' be like, "there he go! " if you put me in disguise 
 Only be with winners, they should put me as a prize 
 And you pussy nigga should be put between some thighs 
 These diamonds here are clearer then H.D. 
 'Em niggas over there are squarer then a H3 
 They can't reach us, that is why the pointin' baby 
 I'm on my job, 'em bitches gon' need appointments baby 
 And if you suckers try to see me, you just look me up 
 I hope the first place, you look me up... HERE I GO! 
 So fly (so fly), so fly (so fly), 
 You might see a nigga' if ya look up in the sky like, 
 There he go, (there he go) 
 There he go, (there he go) 
 There go that motherfucker. 
 I'm so fly (so fly), so fly (so fly) 
 You might see me when you look up in the sky like, 
 There she go (there she go) 
 There she go (there she go) 
 There go that motherfucker.

 Get the magazine if you wanna' +Vibe+ with' it 
 That rich, young clean like I mixed tide with' it 
 Now I be live with' it, I turns all my lovers 
 To lollipop girls, now they all suckers 
 And we all are gutter, the flyest of 'em all 
 Light, L-Light fire to 'em all...

 Stones clear, like my mom's miss Clair Bourne

 Yo' street's in a spurr, flyin' you see the blurr, UHH...
