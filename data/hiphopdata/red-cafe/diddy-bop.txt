Xreefa! 
 I don't know how to dance [x4] 
 One for the strap that I keep close 
 And it go blat! 
 No I can't dance, but I be swervin' 
 I just diddy bop, do the pee wee herman. 
 Nigga say aw, tell me where you been 
 I been on the block with the work tell a friend 
 Nigga double up every time that I spit 
 Send it to houston watch it flip again, again, 
 I'm a bird man ask baby 
 Shots of patrone make the girls go crazy 
 Ma, what cha gon do? 
 I'm with the shakedown you can bring your whole crew. 
 We ain't here to fight, we just wanna cut 
 Dip it down low, do the walk do the butt 
 Got my own cash and a big wheel 
 Fresh pair of nike's yeah I know you like me 
 I heard 'em say 
 Don't look for me I be in the club 
 Don't ask for me I been in da hood 
 I can't lean back I been in the club 
 I don't know how to snap I been in the hood 
 So I diddy bop, I don't know how to dance [x4] 
 Now hold up (wait a minute) 
 One yellow bottle and shit don't stop 
 Red caf√© get it down for the town 
 Nigga stay fresh till the girls go aww 
 Arm and hammer man with jimmy crack corn 
 Gimme the crack, guess what, crack gone! 
 Gimme the weed, guess what, weed gone! 
 Is that your chick? (shorty) she gone! 
 Two for the cash that I got stacked real low on the stash 
 See I diddy bop 'cause I got bad feet 
 But when I'm on the floor all eyes on me 
 Then we fall through move like a mobsta 
 They ain't like us they window shoppers 
 And I don't slip keeps that chopper 
 Down in the a on the low from the coppers 
 Yeah brooklyn! diddy bop 
 Yeah south side! diddy bop 
 Yeah west side! diddy bop 
 Yeah everybody! diddy bop 
 I don't know how to dance [x4]

 A reefa production 
 Shakedown!
