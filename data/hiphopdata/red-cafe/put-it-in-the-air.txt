Smoke weed every day 
 Light it up 
 ... I am knowly 
 So high I crush the party 
 So fly 
 I flush the carty 
 Spread... on the armani 
 Big... big wheel 
 Hold up I am a mother fucker big deal 
 And my lady would be so chic 
 Channel louis vuiton make me... 
 I am the real red 
 The cool got no top without... 
 The most elevate it 
 Cooking up the right boy 
 Smoke weed every day 
 Light it up 
 Smoke weed every day 
 Light it up 
 Finally the earth come around 
 ... Thousand feet I ain't coming down 
 ... Now when are you moving with the mafia you are running town 
 ... Smoking on Friday smoking while I am doing number on the highway 
 ... Money coming I use money to shower 
 ... Can I keep me a bitch to push the v for me 
 Get on her knees for me 
 Roll weed for me 
 True shit I am living just like a king 
 So why 
 Smoke weed every day 
 Light it up 
 Smoke weed every day 
 Light it up
