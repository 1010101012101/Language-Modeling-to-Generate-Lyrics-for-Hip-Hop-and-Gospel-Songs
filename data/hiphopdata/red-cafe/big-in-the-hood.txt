Look I'm big in the hood, big in the hood 
 Big in the hood, big in the hood 
 Automatic weapons blowing hella sour 
 Keep my bitches like my money, coming every hour

 I'm a lover, baby, I'm not a fighter 
 So I keep the shooter close like I keep the lighter 
 I'm a Bad Boy but I ain't Black Rob 
 I ain't Pastor Mase, I'm with the Black Mob 
 We run up in your house, we'll take our hats off 
 We put that fire to that kush then we blast off 
 Look I ain't Big Meech, look I ain't Larry Hoover 
 But I'm big in the hood, I got them Barracudas 
 I'm in the Cadillac, sitting on 24s 
 No album, still I get plenty hoes 
 Polo everything, down to the socks 
 My whole Chevy, doll, down to the blocks 
 Look I'm big in the hood, big in the hood 
 Big in the hood, big in the hood 
 Automatic weapons blowing hella sour 
 Keep my bitches like my money, coming every hour 
 Look I'm big in the hood, big in the hood 
 Big in the hood, big in the hood 
 Automatic weapons blowing hella sour 
 Keep my bitches like my money, coming every hour 
 Every day you see me, Gucci this, Louis that 
 And my lady being, Gucci this, Louis that 
 And now I got my Skoda on the road 
 I'm finna judge the local town and jump alone 
 Now look at me, bitch, I'm pretty photogenic 
 The Swagmanian Devil and I can't even spell it

 My whole sticky nicky, see they got hella wigs 
 I don't pay for pussy, but I tip them well
