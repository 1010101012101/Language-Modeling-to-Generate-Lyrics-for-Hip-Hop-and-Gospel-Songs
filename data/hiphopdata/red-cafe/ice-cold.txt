 I'm runnin' the town, no fuckin' around 
 I'm fuckin' with Hov, I'm back on the brown 
 Walk through the valley, the shadow of death 
 I'm pitchin the white like I'm back when I'm out 
 Bangin' this pussy while you on yo feelings 
 Makin' a killin', got work and I'm villain 
 Livin' the life of a hustla child 
 Pop me a freak then I'm back to the dealin' 
 We in the streets, just me and my dawg 
 Ridin' around with the strap and it cocked 
 My niggas shooters, my bitches is 'bout it 
 We smoking and drinkin', get fucked by the law 
 Ice, ice cold 
 And we back to the hood with the OG kush, that boy psycho
