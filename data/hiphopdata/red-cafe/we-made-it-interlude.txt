I got bad girls with bad habits 
 Sex good, I mean fantastic 
 Clean mouth from the dirty south 
 Dirty red, old dirty bastard 
 Box killa, got the box mastered 
 Top choice, still papa ratchin' 
 Hit the thang with that King-Kong 
 Then I back 'em off and give them hot flashes 
 In the belly like ant asses 
 She suck the cock like she had practice 
 Jury all on my thriller jacket 
 Strapped up, can't forget the rapping 
 Hold up! Lemme wave at the haters 
 That hate from a distance 
 I be on camels in Dubai 
 Nigga, we stunt from a distance 
 Drunken flying than all of y'all 
 Kush got me higher than all of y'all 
 My chick bad and her friends bad 
 She put it on me, I walk it off 
 What up 
 Nigga we made it, aye 
 We made it 
 Nigga we made it, aye 
 Damn, we made it 
 Nigga we made it, aye 
 We made it, aye 
 Nigga we made it, aye 
 We made it
