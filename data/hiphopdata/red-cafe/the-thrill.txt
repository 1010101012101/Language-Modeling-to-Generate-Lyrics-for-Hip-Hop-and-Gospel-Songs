When it comes to it, 
 It's all about that thrill, right? 
 This Red Caf√©, this bad boy, man! 
 Let's be the nigga that was born to do it 
 The conartist riding on the condo it 
 The Jews like Liberace gold shit 
 Whole shit, we don't tolerate this real nigga holiday 
 A safe day for me, pray for me 
 Keep these fuck niggas way from me! 
 Speak to the G code, 
 Practice discipline 
 I know my niggas thuggin' in the fair 
 Listening. Make my own rules, so I got some home rules 
 Never fuck lame hoes that blame it on the booze 
 The caps feelers with hose choose 
 Screw that shit, I ain't familiar, that's a point of failure 
 I know niggas with albums that go broke 
 I'm a rich nigga, no albums, I got the votes 
 I'm done, keys to your bitch ignition 
 I turn her on, gas up on her, then I'm gone 
 Here to win, yeah, it's him again 
 No mistakin', where he from, summertime timbalands 
 The killer in the dutch, I'm a killer in the clutch 
 Freak with chows, know the least, order the duck 
 My bitches is anything but basic 
 This basic, bear witness to greatness 
 (My bitches is anything but basic) 
 (This basic, bear witness to greatness) 
 Follow along, rap phenomenon, back from along 
 Got that girl soaking wet, she back up in the stall 
 Red October, the wait's over 
 You can tell'em Cinderellas the date's over 
 Got a bottle of Yeks, few J's, I'm going up 
 Right back in the psyche ward, I'm going nuts 
 Take what I want, I build my team on trust 
 Only thing I gots to give is a fuck 
 Fuck off! I finna get my nut off 
 Freak with ball shit you ain't used to, it's crucial 
 I take a 95 girl on scripple 
 Long as she come with a nigga, I ain't gotta kiss 'er 
 Filthy, Brooklyn built me 
 Smoking, drinking, cashing out, I'm guilty, 
 I don't like it, cause you never wipe it 
 He just popped doing a flash, that light me 
 My chicks pop tags like Sarah Jessica 
 Clean the royal nuts when they come to America 
 Love to you boy, royalty, killer in these streets 
 Suckers don't toy with me 
 Nah, penthouse booked up, you know it's us 
 Back to these bricks, watch the dose stack up 
 Penthouse booked up, you know it's us 
 Back to these bricks, watch the dose stack up
