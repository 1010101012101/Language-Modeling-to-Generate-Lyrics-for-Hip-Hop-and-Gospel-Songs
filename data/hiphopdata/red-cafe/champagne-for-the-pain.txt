Everybody fuckin' tonight nigga 
 It's Tha World, nigga it's a gangsta party 
 Livin' that good life, real nigga recipe 
 Real talk!

 Champagne for the pain 
 I've been blowin' all this money, tell them niggas keep the change

 Real niggas run the world hah 
 Everybody fuckin' tonight

 Dear God, I'm a baller 
 Fuck a pretty girl, I don't call her 
 Smokin' good, livin' motherfuckin' great 
 Need my work raw, and my liquor no chase 
 Bitch straight up, straight up look 
 I've just got my weight up 
 So when I tell her bust it for me, she don't tell me wait up 
 We smokin' exotic, we stackin' this profit 
 We runnin' the streets, getting paper, be the topics 
 This a hood nigga 
 What they judging me? 
 Hatin' on me but the real niggas fuck with me 
 My lady said she don't want no money, just time 
 Bullshit, my lawyer showed me money buy time 
 I've been on the grind, paper flippin' acrobatic 
 Fuck with Bad Boy, made sense mathematical 
 Hold up, I just seen a dealer in the mirror 
 Shorty pull your titties out for a 'bout it ass nigga 
 Champagne for the pain

 Real niggas run the world hah 
 I say now real niggas run the world, real hustlers run the girl 
 She rockin' tequila all night 'til I fuck in her 
 Swerve up out the lot, where they screamin' "It's tha fuckin' world" 
 Worked out with them bricks, damn right, you know we like to curl 
 Short day, long nights, plumber baby long pipe 
 I be in them coupes so much, you swear them photos old strikes 
 Make them bricks stay the night, you could call it slumber party 
 Could be over any day, every night I'mma party 
 Last night I went so hard I almost died, swear to God 
 These niggas hood passing, checking out, yea I swear they frauds 
 Pull up in that Mercy, have mercy on these bitches 
 Keep a bottle water for these thirsty ass bitches 
 All bullshit aside I used to hustle on the go 
 Four milly for the penthouse and guess who is the owner 
 These hatin' ass niggas stay talking 'bout nothing 
 Champagne for the pain tonight everybody fuckin' 
 Champagne for the pain 
 I've been blowin' all this money, tell them niggas keep the change 
 I got girls doing girls 
 I'm a real motherfucker 
 Real niggas run the world hah 
 Everybody fuckin' tonight 
 Everybody fuckin' tonight 
 I got girls doing girls 
 I'm a real motherfucker 
 Real niggas run the world hah
