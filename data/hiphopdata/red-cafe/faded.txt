I got a feeling 
 A real good feeling 
 I?mma be faded 
 The bar is open 
 We just bought it 
 I?mma be faded 
 Let the Champaign p-o-o-o-ur 
 P-o-o-o-ur, p-o-o-o-ur 
 Let the Champaign p-o-o-o-ur 
 P-o-o-o-ur, p-o-o-o-ur 
 (Red Café) 
 Damn I look good, Somebody take a photo 
 I run my his-house, You can ask Jojo 
 Yank fitted on, My money on Jeter 
 My girls all dimes, Lou Vuitton Divas 
 I'm fly like an overnight letter 
 Shorty sleep with me 
 Make your overnights wetter 
 Better I'm faded (I'm faded) 
 And tonight I'm gonna get wasted 
 See to everybody listening, if it's on I?mma get at 'em 
 I can say whatever I'm a tax paying citizen 
 Middle finger up, I ain't got a conscience 
 I just go hard like the trio from Yonkers 
 Head honcho, Kush in the console 
 Bad boy, now they shook like Cosmo's 
 I'm all that, everyday all black 
 Got Ciroc on deck so I'm faded off that 
 (Rick Ross) 
 Two homes on the block 
 Each one mill and this ring on my finger is an E one deal 
 Canary yellow stone, can't be faded 
 Fatigue belt, 45 made for the navy 
 Young n-ggas ready to grapple down ya buildin? 
 I'm living chilling, arms wrapped around a Brazilian 
 In the presence of a Don, be cautious but calm 
 Can't be faded, two pills a charm 
 She licks on my chest, reading tatts on my arm 
 Hit her form the back, same time my mind blown 
 Speechless so she scream in silence 
 A real bad boy and all my speeches violent 
 (Red Café) 
 Pour for them white girls, them light girls 
 We just buy all these bottles cause it excites girls 
 Yeah shorty go on kill a runway 
 I knew you would have been a supermodel one day 
 I'm mashing out lighting up on a highway 
 Shit, I'm supposed to be high 
 It's the highway 
 Anybody wanna eat? Come saddle up 
 My team getting money, everybody tatted up 
 Marqee status, flights no baggage 
 Dope dicks make these hoes Cafe addicts 
 And I am the most hated 
 Bottles to the face, shake it up then spray it
