I was sitting up above the clouds 
 Then one day you just came soaring by 
 Then my life just took a sudden turn 
 If I? 
 I was sitting up above the clouds 
 Then one day you just came soaring by 
 Then my life just took a sudden turn 
 Light it up till we hit the roof 
 Till that coconut? got em getting loose 
 We above em all now they wanna call a truce 
 But I'm quarterbacking busy calling? 
 Cruising through the finish line 
 I'm still eating dinner baby I ain't finished mine 
 Everybody want the throne, y'all get in line 
 I'm comfortable, I got a dime and I got a nine 
 Wassup, I'm sitting way above the clouds 
 Like I'm on the stage and I'm above the crowd 
 Preach capital game in a microphone 
 Feel it till these half-way crooks leave the mic alone 
 Nigga y'all killing the feeling 
 Got a nigga ready to go back killing them dealing 
 Meanwhile I'm still letting the kush burn 
 Everybody judging me 
 I guess it's a contest, yeah and I see the victory right in front of me 
 I turn back and trip em with no conscience 
 I know, no class, no sportsmanship 
 With that attitude I see no fortune, shit 
 But ask me if I give a fuck 
 I'm still winning and they calling it beginner's luck 
 Riding around in a bulletproof tinted truck 
 I know they got love but shit, they might hit it up 
 Yeah just to get a name, just to get the fame 
 But all the hoes screaming they just wanna get your man 
 They know I got it and I spit it 
 I get money every day, ain't none of this rented 
 I gotta get it, gotta finish the herb
