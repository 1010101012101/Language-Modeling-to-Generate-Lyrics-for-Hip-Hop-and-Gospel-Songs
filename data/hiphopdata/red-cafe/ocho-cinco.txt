 Or from the nose down 
 I tell her nose dive, then watch 'em go down, (woop, woop, woop, woop, woop) 
 Bitch I'm cold as ice water, put dick way down yo throat until yo eyes water 
 Lemme get that for ya, lil mama cause you workin' 
 The way you twerkin', you could fuck around and get a Birkin' 
 She like to crack the dutch down the middle 
 Drop a Purp in, let me fuck her in the telly 
 Screaming open up the curtains like (Don't Stop Pop That) 
 You know French cut, she got on French Cuts 
 I don't French kiss, I let my friends cut 
 Me and Red in an all red Benz truck 
 I told French I told Los I get good head while I'm chauffeured 
 Momma told me get a nice girl with a good head on her shoulders 
 Shake down shake down 
 Came up on them back blocks 
 Her face on my belt buckle that's what I call (laptop) 
 Side niggas from the side watchin', guess they got a side view 
 Puff got me in this penthouse 
 That's my view 
 That's my crew, they shinin' 
 She only came so she could come floss 
 And her first choice was the number one boss 
 Niggas from the side watchin' 
 Got a 100 grand in my side pocket 
 Yo bitch, I'm a mothafuckin livin' legend 
 I'm 'bout to send these niggas through they fifth depression 
 In my absences niggas speaking silly 
 I could stand on the mountains and the streets'll feel me 
 Feel the rush of that Bad Boy 
 O.B.G. that OG Don't OD 'cause that's bad boy 
 She feel royal when she 'round this 
 King Combs, now give me crown, bitch
