Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil 
 Finger of suspicion 
 Pointing at us all 
 Says I'm guilty by omission 
 And heading for a fall 
 When the rumors fly 
 Someone's gonna cry 
 I wish they mind a private affair 
 You might love to take a turn 
 And don't care who you hurt 
 But the damage that you do 
 Just might come back on you 
 Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil 
 About nobody 
 Hear no evil, see no evil 
 'Cause what you don't know won't hurt you oh no 
 Bad news travels faster 
 People read between the line 
 Courting a disaster 
 Just suits some people fine 
 Now the word is out 
 There's a shadow of doubt 
 Another woman catching my eye 
 Oh, who are they 
 To talk that way 
 I wish they'd leave me alone 
 They got troubles of their own 
 Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil 
 About nobody 
 Hear no evil, see no evil 
 'Cause what you don't know won't hurt you oh no 
 Talk is cheap 
 Cheek to cheek 
 Don't speak 
 Don't sneak a peak 
 Talk is cheap 
 Cheek to cheek 
 Don't speak 
 Don't sneak a peak 
 Talk is cheap 
 Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil 
 About nobody 
 Hear no evil, see no evil 
 'Cause what you don't know won't hurt you oh no 
 Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil 
 About nobody 
 Hear no evil, see no evil 
 'Cause what you don't know won't hurt you oh no
