 With a m-r-m-a-g-i-c 
 My name's mr. magic and you know that's me 
 Mr. magic that's who I be 
 Soon to be mr. magic o.b.e. 
 When I was boy in my home town 
 I did not know that I'd be throwin' down 
 But as I got older, I got bolder 
 Realized that I was never falter 
 Went this all new town doin' to my name 
 Like dmc, I was looking for fame 
 So I joined with the wax dance party 
 And that is why you're listenin' to me 
 'Cause... 
 Wax!
