*Scratchin* 
 Yes yes y'all (x8) 
 Ruff rugged tha incredible one, Soopafly come wit tha bomb 
 A pound to brake a muthafucka down 
 Surrounded, by subliminal thoughts to keep me criminal minded 
 You'll find its hard fuckin' wit a dog that'll scar 
 Your whole mind body soul approach 
 Devastated, elevated your shit never made it 
 However can one dare to compare a style rare from ground, to air above 
 Showin no love, now it's tha pimpin' flow 
 Interests show, that you ain't hittin no mo 
 Your shit's gettin' old, forget tha past 
 Don't let tha past pave a way to tha world 
 Occupied by MCs that I slay 
 Affect tha first when I select a verse 
 To hit you with tha worse intention 
 Blast in three dimension, sharp like a ginzu 
 Then you will understand that I split niggas to fragments of a man 
 Differental from pots to pans, opposition at a glance 
 I rate, and takin' chances quick to brake like branches 
 I'm like a banchy on a midnight get right or get even 
 You're Wondering like Steven running from day light to evening 
 Time, 'cause I bust shots to injure 
 I stay black and smooth like a ninja 
 It's Soopafly quick to throw them thangs 
 I get tha money and rings, muthafuckaz can't hang 'cause 
 I don't hang with no bustas 
 I don't hang with no fags 
 I don't hang with no connivin ass niggas who ain't out 
 There makin' cash 
 Sho nuff don't hang with no snitches 
 Sho nuff don't fuck with no bitches 
 I'm only out for my riches 
 So muthafuckaz stay tha fuck out my business 
 *Scratchin* 
 "Feel tha beat" 
 "I gots to have it"(x3) 
 I'm unexplanatory like Rogaine 
 What's your name was mine? 
 Soopafly game do or die 
 Death becomes those who oppose and run up 
 Muthafuckaz get done up, on a one two come up (come up) 
 Evidently you've been bitin for years 
 All skills to adapt to (nigga I'll pimp slap you) 
 My rhyme trap you, attractin bitches and hoes 
 Then developin tha 51 flows 
 I suppose, I got you runnin' like your nose 
 Like threat, shot, to my niggas that can't get wet 
 Betcha, I spoke a lecture 
 I let cha think everythin's fine 
 Then react inna blinks time 
 Over-done, I'm rated number one contender 
 Tha war zone engage or surrender 
 Now if tha kicks fit nigga wear that shit 
 Give me a stage and microphone I'm bound to tear that shit 
 Tha fuck up, now what cha gon do? 
 Take a seat, or step to my mystic well then pack tha concrete 
 Now how you gonna act? I'll lay your ass flat 
 It's Soopafly comin' with tha shit like that (like that like that) 
 "I gots to have it, 'cause I want it, and I need it" (x2) 
 Now only I control thee unfold thee 
 Uncut and uncensored floatin ?vinta?, it's ah 
 Sort of like a mixture, can you picture 
 One calm and cool one that burn like the sun 
 The one two two to three 
 Soopafly rolls freely (freely) 
 High to the sky, muthafuckas can't see me (see me) 
 I'm skulls like a beanie (beanie) 
 I'm disappearin like a genie (genie) 
 Intoxicated off tha Remy (Remy) 
 Martin I'm startin to box up fools by tha carton 
 It's tha one, incredible fly 
 I fly by day, droppin' bombs on thee E.P. 
 With Dat Nigga Daz still representin' D.P. 
 Now I don't hang with no bustas 
 And I don't hang with no fags 
 And I don't hang with no connivin ass niggas who ain't 
 Out there makin' cash 
 Sho nuff don't hang with no snitches 
 Sho nuff don't fuck with no bitches 
 I'm only out for my riches 
 So muthafuckaz stay tha fuck out my business 
 Waitin baitin for my ass to flip flop but I don't flop 
 (Flop flop) (x4) 
 No I don't
