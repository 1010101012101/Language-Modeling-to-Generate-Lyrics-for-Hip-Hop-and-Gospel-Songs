 (Soopafly) 
 Now I can't be called never losing y'all 
 No sweat, no disrespect (I ain't tripping) 
 I didn't know we were picking choosing y'all 
 So look back for them westcoast niggas 
 The come and toast niggas 
 We ride back and fly flat 
 We fly, we high off contact 
 Eastside representer, Soopafly with bomb raps 
 Westcoast, hit 'em up we all that, yeah we trip they fall back 
 We cool like the wind yo, but don't sabotage we lead 
 We gangsta azz niggaz, we could still be friends though 
 A here drink and smoke my weed 
 It's the bomb, I hit with y'all 
 Do your thang, ain't no found no harm 
 A nigga need a hand, I lend him my arm 
 We knock that bad homie, we like to party hard 
 Do our thang too, whips and chains too 
 It's all lame though, real niggaz connected closer to the seen yo 
 No matter where you from we should all have some 
 We all going stay fight, we all going run 
 The game, it's a shame that niggaz think I want the fame 
 Naw, I don't give a damn just know my name 
 As far as coming out, I'm here to blame 
 Now we here mother fuckers, treat us the same 
 (Chorus: Soopafly) 
 They act like they just don't hear us 
 They know we just don't play 
 But don't be afaired to fear us, its off with s.o.k 
 Don't be so loud, just cheer us 
 Say what you want to say 
 It's like long beach can feel us 
 Welcome bacc to L.A 
 (Daz Dillinger) 
 Who am I the d.a.z 
 Give to fuckin' fresh soul la v 
 His name is soopafly, it's all dp 
 Westcoast from the seas, most definitely (I don't like that Shit) 
 When you see me in the crowd, high talking loud 
 Acting wild, its just my style 
 You feeling this labeled as an minis as a game of affiliates 
 Six-hundred of lorenzo's, nigga we willing it 
 I make the party say hoe, I kick flow 
 Rock shows, be on flows like the wind blow 
 Stay out and burn rubber and leave clouds of indo smoke 
 Like Rock "I ain't no joke" 
 Don't fold up, but choke up 
 Don't provoke us loc, we coast to coast that rock the most 
 A band from f am dial, say fuck it have a joint and smile, still on the 
 Proud, 
 Be on the underground I drop sounds pro-found out of bounds 
 Capture your audio, flow like with me like an accordion 
 I'm turn of the world bitch azz, niggaz, and girls 
 I'm on the cross fade, I made and learn trade to get paid 
 You might be slave for the crave what I made 
 Dropping at the 1, 2, 3 
 (Xzibit) 
 X to the z rocking with dpg 
 (Chorus: Soopafly) 
 They act like they just don't hear us 
 They know we just don't play 
 But don't be afaired to fear us, its off with s.o.k 
 Don't be so loud, just cheer us 
 Say what you want to say 
 It's like long beach can feel us 
 Welcome bacc to L.A 
 (Xzibit) 
 Look, now tell me what's stopping you from hanging around 
 Stuck in you hotel room whenever you come in to town 
 I see niggaz prupotrating like they loving L.A 
 They show it in video and radio play 
 Everyday I got to deal with this industry shit 
 A bunch so call heavyweights that's scared to get hit 
 Prepare to get lick, what the best choke of the smoke 
 Politics separate chips, we all can get rich 
 Be off like Tennessee's, we on the same team or we enemies 
 I ain't got to many of them, a lot of hand guns and homies 
 I got plenty of them, I just make one phone call you get Rid with ten 
 That's only when you try to get slick and try to cross me 
 Now let's talk about promotion of croissants and coffee 
 Look, I'm from the place that thought the world how to gang bang 
 Now I'm going take to top of the food chang 
 (Chorus x2: Soopafly) 
 They act like they just don't hear us 
 They know we just don't play 
 But don't be afaired to fear us, its off with s.o.k 
 Don't be so loud, just cheer us 
 Say what you want to say 
 It's like long beach can feel us 
 Welcome bacc to L.A.
