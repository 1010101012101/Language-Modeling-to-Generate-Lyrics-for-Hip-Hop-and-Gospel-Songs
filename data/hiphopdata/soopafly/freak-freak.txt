 (Soopafly) 
 It's soopafly y'all, dunking quit with the rhymes y'all 
 Everybody know I do it a long time y'all 
 I'm nice, I'm so nice I walk like Christ 
 With my pimping so smooth thinking I'm skating on ice 
 Tell you one time come back and shoot you twice 
 Nigga name your price, I freak your wife 
 I walk away pimp strutting with the shit in you love it 
 Attitude don't give a fuck push and shoving 
 Turn you home baby because I act so crazy 
 Having tossed with a feud with my lady 
 Treat a bitch like a Whodini and make the freak come out 
 Got evicted for days what you talking about 
 You know I'm down for getting laid and I love your figure 
 You getting clothes, but it is paid by some other nigga 
 Its cool you know Soopafly got something bigga 
 You know I have you going off like a trigga 
 One bitch is all I need, But having two hoes is like having cash and weed 
 Don't be mad because a nigga wont speak 
 Soopafly my name now freak, freak (Y'all, Y'all) 
 I play a bitch like playing a dozen 
 If I can't freak the hoe I passed down to my cousin 
 It's the proper dime from making something to nothing 
 Fuck the other shit we get it to love it 
 Why do you think you the shit 
 Knowing you couldn't even pay my rent 
 Baby girl it's like a pimp thang 
 Soopafly quick to get in thangs 
 Ain't in to nothing but slanging them thangs 
 Who could ever rock crowd no doubt 
 It's what Soopafly do when the day show out 
 Yeah, I know I shine you like chrome 
 Armor all mother fuckers in my pimped out room 
 I say I do anything for you, Now you know that ain't true 
 I pimping the bitch so hard, I make her sleep in the yard 
 I ain't playing one hoe with bomb 
 (Soopafly Hook) 
 They can't stop me from saying one bitch is all need 
 But having two hoes like ash and weed 
 Don't be mad because a nigga don't want to speak 
 Soopafly my name now freak, freak (Y'all, Y'all, Y'all) 
 They can't stop me from saying one bitch is all need 
 But having two hoes like ash and weed 
 Don't be mad because a nigga ain't weak 
 Soopafly my name now freak, freak (Y'all, Y'all, Y'all) 
 (Soopafly Chorus 3x) 
 Freak, Freak (Y'all, Y'all, Y'all) 
 (Soopafly) 
 Check it out I'm working down the shadrach 
 Me shack when been to go 
 Baby you could come with ugly friend and go 
 I'm being blunt ain't nobody going to hit that yo 
 It's like dead weight and I hate to roll 
 Plus it's the freak, freak looking for something unique 
 Putting in pass and put her to sleep 
 I been around to get down 
 Cover ground on the way to your town 
 Still represent that would say I'll be back to tomorrow 
 Oh Yeah, Took your man's watch you ain't got to know 
 Put the money on the table baby we can make dough 
 I'm coming out like Dianna Ross until my paper show, Silly Hoe 
 (Soopafly Hook) 
 They can't stop me from saying one bitch is all need 
 But having two hoes like ash and weed 
 Don't be mad because a nigga don't want to speak 
 Soopafly my name now freak, freak (Y'all, Y'all, Y'all) 
 (Soopafly Chorus 5x)
