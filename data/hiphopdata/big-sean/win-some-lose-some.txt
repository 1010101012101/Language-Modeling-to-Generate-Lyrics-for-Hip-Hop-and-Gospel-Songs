You win some and lose some, I heard that my whole life 
 I heard that my whole life, but that doesn't make it right 
 (Okay, you got ahead tonight) 
 Man, that doesn't make it right 
 Man, that doesn't make it right 
 How do you sleep at night? 
 Sean, nigga you on, damn, nigga, you on 
 You was a millionaire but your niggas is still at home 
 Damn, nigga, you did it, but damn it you did it wrong 
 You got time for that gig, but not time for the phone 
 Got it right with your ends, but fucked it up with your friends 
 I seen your ass up on TV, touched up on them twins 
 You don't know about hard times, you clutched up in that Benz 
 Get tired of fuckin' hoes then get to fuckin' their friends, wow 
 Niggas want handouts, and I only got two 
 Now I'm on the phone talkin' to my mom like I only got you 
 Gettin' dressed up for court, that's a law suit 
 Ain't wearin' V necks, but niggas ask what happened to the crew 
 Now I'm in court for some shit I didn't do 
 Cause of my nigga, knowin' my career could've been through 
 So when it's time to travel management say I only need to 
 Listenin' to them when I'm the one that makes the rules 
 I'm just a victim of the life though that I ain't tryna lose 
 This the dream, I had a wake up call and missed snooze 
 Lately though my family been too happy 
 I just turned my mama hooptie to a new Caddy 
 People thinkin' I'm rich and I wish they knew that 
 I been signed for four years and I'm just able to do that 
 Worry 'bout my next Rolex time piece 
 My nigga Tone worry 'bout our sis, Shanice 
 We supposed to be the role models 
 No wonder why she wanna smoke weed and skip college 
 Is this the example I'm tryna set? 
 Are these the people I'mma forget? 
 Are these the times I'mma regret? 
 Livin' life wishin' I could hit reset but, but 
 You win some and lose some, I heard that my whole life 
 I heard that my whole life, but that doesn't make it right 
 (Okay, you got ahead tonight) 
 Man, that doesn't make it right 
 Man, that doesn't make it right 
 How do you sleep at night? 
 Okay, you win some, lose some, break some, bruise some 
 Life could be a test, multiple choice, choose some 
 Choose one, stick with it, man, prove some 
 Sometimes the best teachers is ourselves goin' through somethin' 
 Real life will teach your ass way fucking fast 
 I always thought my last girl was supposed to be my last 
 I got four aunties, two uncles, one dad 
 One mom, two brothers, and 200 niggas mad 
 And it's only one me, divide it and do the math 
 I'm the one that dropped out, got no time for the class 
 How am I supposed to have time for everyone I just said? 
 I don't even have time for everything in my head 
 On my way to see Kim and Ye both tie the knot 
 Wishin' me and you were no strings attached, but were nots 
 Man that's drama, drama drama 
 So deep that call each others mamas' mamas 
 We need a break I mean comma, comma comma 
 I'm tryin', homie 
 But she always picks the wrong time, my phone's dyin' on me 
 In the bed cryin' on me, talkin' lyin' on me 
 It sucks to hit the internet and see your lyin' on me 
 Is this the example I'm tryna set? 
 Are these the people I'mma forget? 
 Are these the times I'mma regret? 
 Livin' life wishin' I could hit reset but, but 
 You win some and lose some, I heard that my whole life 
 I heard that my whole life, but that doesn't make it right 
 (Okay, you got ahead tonight) 
 Man, that doesn't make it right 
 Man, that doesn't make it right 
 How do you sleep at night?
