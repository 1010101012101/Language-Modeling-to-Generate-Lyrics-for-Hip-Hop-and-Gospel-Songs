I Say, I Say Oh my God, 
 I can't tell what's a better accessory, 
 My new watch or the chick that's standing right next to me, 
 Killing niggas at rap, but being a man's my specialty, 
 I love shitting on all my ex's especially, 
 Ohohohoh I'm dumb high, dumb high, 
 Yeah throwing West side bitch I run my, 
 So slow it down like I got my thumb high, 
 I got 'Em on they knees, like I got my gun high, 
 I'm in my old school, I feel like the alumni, 
 Car looking like its sitting on 30 floors, 
 30 doors, 30 whores, few black bitches and perky whores, This shit looks like Jersey Shore, 
 I'm on fire boy loose cannon, 
 My car Bruce Wayne, I feel like I'm Bruce Brana, 
 I'm ripping clothes off, 
 Car so big when I whip that shit, don't stand to close when I hit them curves, mother fucka might clip them toes off, 
 I said BIG I'm that important, 
 You spend all night with her spooning, I spend all night with her forking, 
 Whaaaaat, 
 Riding low puffing on Loud, 
 I came to far to up end her now, 
 Text from my Mom's saying "Me and Your Grandma proud" 
 I'm way to deep in the game to go sit back in the crowd, 
 Teacher told my get a job save up for 401k, 
 I'd rather be young as hell counting 401k, 
 I'ma probably die getting some head, 
 I'm just multiplying my money and dividing the legs, 
 B.I. whaaat, 
 But I'm never dividing the bread, 
 Bitch I bet I'll go to debit if I don't get the cred... that I deserve, 
 Yo I say, I'm throwing west side up like Pac, 
 When they pop yo block up, b-b-b-block up, 
 Big Poppa, flock off, 
 You holy, lil Woly, Holy kimoly, Chewbacca, 
 I'm Lensiauga Ormez, but I bet You that You wont find it, 
 Rocking Louie and MCM guess I'm closed minded, 
 Promise me you won't below up in the Joe Bynum, 
 I'm in yo city just chillen, where all yo hoes hiding, 
 20k for the wrist, cause its 24 karats, 
 And I can't lie, the price will probably go up when I wear it, 
 I'm just D-town repping, 
 And making all these niggas that second guessed it, regret it, 
 Regret it like half the hoes I smash in the sheets, 
 At least now I realize how much I love Assie Marie, 
 And when it's all said and done, I'll probably give her my knee, 
 She put with way too many games not to have a ring, boy
