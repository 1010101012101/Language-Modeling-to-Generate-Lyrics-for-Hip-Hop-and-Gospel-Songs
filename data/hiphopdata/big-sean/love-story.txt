I feel good, I feel wonderful 
 And that's because, you made it that way 
 I feel super, spectacular because of you 
 And now I'm flying, I think I'm floating 
 I feel so high, your love takes me to the sky 
 If I fall, I won't care 'cause I'm safe with you 
 'Cause I'm in love with your story 
 And I'm love with your smell and your smile 
 So keep on lifting, I won't stand in your way 
 'Cause I'm in love with you 
 Now baby ur the truth, so I'm just being honest 
 U treat me like a king so that's y ur my highness 
 That means queen seems I known you for the longest 
 Funny how we connected on the low like vonage 
 And I know it ain't as deep as it could be, or as it would be but that's how it should be 
 'Cause over time we gone be fine like wine, I neva put another ova mine 
 See difference between you and them, is they just wanna shine and well you, u just want sean 
 So tell mama sandy, mama myra and that family, that when I get that grammy, they gone be a granny 
 And if I see that reaper, before you see that reaper 
 Just know I love you every time you hear me through them speakers 
 And I ain't tryna blow ur head up like reefa but we got chemistry to the point we need a beaker 
 So promise that ull keep me, promise you won't leave astray 
 U promise me forever, you promise me to stay 
 So I keep you with my laughter, feel so complete 
 There's something bout ur brown eyes, that gets me lost for days 
 Ur touch is like an angel looking out for heavans grace 
 And that's y, ill keep you sheltered from the storm 
 I need you here with me 
 'Cause I'm love with your story 
 And I'm love with your smell and your smile 
 So keep on lifting, I won't stand in your way, 
 'Cause I'm in love with you 
 Now listen, first off, if it was the last thing 
 Id put you first so you deserve my last name 
 You make my worst days feel like my birthday 
 If we never happen we'll regret it in the worst way 
 Like not seeing the world trade, ur worth the galaxy baby so lets world trade 
 And I tend to tell god thank you, 'cause baby you an angel, at least from my angle 
 'Cause I'm in love with your story, 
 And I'm in love with your smell and your smile 
 So keep on lifting, I won't stand in your way 
 'Cause I'm in love with you
