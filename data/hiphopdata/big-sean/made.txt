Verse 1 Drake 
 Uh, low key Peter Parker flow 
 Tell them bring some aces, spades, no sparkles though 
 Private flights, no hassel, I just park and go 
 I'm the highlight, like when markers glow 
 Ooh, look what you created 
 Only got yourself to blame 
 I remember when you hated ooh 
 Now you tell me take my time 
 How bout I just take your city make that motherfucker mine 
 Uh ha 
 I'm a underground king hoe 
 I sit tall, I swing low 
 The game ain't always fair and that's the thing though 
 You can play your heart out everyone don't get a ring though 
 You are in the presence of a champion 
 Bout to get a condo that I can fit your mansion in 
 You always be calling her, she ain't never answering 
 You ain't figured out I am the reason that she canceling 
 I be at the parties where you stuck outside and can't come in 
 Call me Ron Bergundy y'all the other anchormen

 Cause rumours I'm the new shit 
 And guess what it's true bitch 
 We made it 
 We made it

 They hate us

 Verse 2 Big Sean 
 Ay look, less friends, more bread 
 Less talk, more head 
 Used to ride escorts now I get escorted 
 I'm just waiting on my cue dog, no pledge 
 Said she like all girls I turn that bitch to co-ed 
 Threw her on my track team, handed my baton to her 
 Passed her and blew her off, I chronic Veronica 
 Who got up on my nerves so I had to platonic her 
 No that ain't my girl but every leader needs a Monica 
 I'm the head of my estate, ain't that ironic huh 
 I want the baddest chick to treat my stick like a thermometer 
 Oh, I'm who they going ape shit over 
 I'm who your girlfriend acting like she ain't shit over 
 See broads over niggas 
 Business over broads 
 See business equals money, and money's over all 
 I'm tryna move my momma from the ghetto's to the meadows 
 Well she can't stay in that fucking hood forever, forever 
 Was made for that Mick Jagger shit 
 Baggage check and a chick 
 Fast girls, faster whip, big chains, master shit 
 Bitch I'm living everyday month yearly 
 Yell until you motherfuckers hear me

 Made for the grind 
 Made for the lights 
 Made for the shine
