Tried to write a love song 
 I wanted it to be just right 
 Tried to make it beautiful 
 But all I could think of was our last fight 
 I was going to play it on piano 
 Have the drums come in real bold 
 But I couldn't think of anything good to say 
 So the big ballot strings will never get played 
 Pretty melody I wrote will never get sanged 
 Piece of paper I started with I threw away 
 A song about our love will never see the light of day 
 Why? 
 Cause you made it that way 
 Ohhuhhoh yeah yeah 
 You made it that way 
 I was gonna write you a love song 
 But you screwed it all up 
 Playing games noow ya just a lame whos __ outta luck (crazy ass bitch) 
 I almost wrote you a love song 
 Big sean 
 She threw my watch out the window 
 Chain in her hand 
 She running threw the crib finding anything she can 
 Our relationship is not the only thing that's outta hand she even called my mama and said you need to get ya man cause ya son lying on me I ain't trying to get a tan? 
 And this the last time he'll have me crying in my hands so I'm heading to the club to try and find me a man. bitch you going to the club to try and find a man what is you saying had hoes in passionate night gowns but you the only one imagine in white gowns so where ya left hand you should let me add a ring to it. because mr and ms Anderson just has a ring to it she like why you act like that to me and walk right back mike jack to me 
 Every time we fall out ill throw yo ass out but you just end up boomeranging back to me. what the fuck 
 I was gonna write you a love song 
 But you screwed it all up 
 Playing games noow ya just a lame whos __ outta luck 
 I almost wrote you a love song

 I think you crazy crazy I think you need medication you should calm down you need meditation sending me a text wiith a hundred exclamations about how I'm wrong without any explanation at all, before you say another nigga next up I should call a maid down 'cause I messed up but gave you what you needed even on them shopping sprees I would throw you paper like extra extra (read all about it) she said what if we reversed roles and you were front roll cheering at my first shows and a couple dollar later and some louis vuitton clothes I can fuck a couple niggas thinking you said no 
 If I had no feeling for them then it shouldn't hurt yours and since you never thought ill do it, it even hust more and ill lie about it and you'll find out from the source who word was more truthful then yours. what would you do 
 And I was so glad I didn't ever pen it now you ain't got nothing with ya stupid name in it and if I woulda did woulda probably stay wit ya listening to the lies you were constantly telling boy you did me all wrong what would even make even wanna write you a song so glad I moved on cause now igot a new guy that's turning me on and the big ballot strings are about to get played and the melody I wrote is about to get sanged a song about our love is going to see the light of day. why. cause you made it that way 
 Ooh yeah you made it that way 
 Oh oh yeah I was going to write you a love song but you screwed it all up playing games no your just a lame that's shit outta luck I almost wrote you a love song
