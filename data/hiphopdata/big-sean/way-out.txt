(Big Sean) 
 Man I wish that I could kill her 
 I wish that I could still feel her 
 Now I'm at the club looking for a fill up 
 Bar tender make sure my drink stay filled up 
 Man look at this mess I'm in 
 In my darkest hours I can't see the horizons 
 But I still remember her sizes 
 34 25 35in 
 And I'm the man to these broads 
 Who one glass I could get her to my nas 
 Through wall and screaming and audio applause 
 I'm Mr big shot but you was my star 
 Hey Juliet I guess our books done huh 
 You know I ain't book smart 
 'Cause I just thought that was a book mark 
 And we could've pick up where we left off 
 (Mr. Hudson) 
 Nothing left to say now 
 I'll be on my way now 
 I'll be moving way up, way up, way up 
 There's nothing left to say now 
 I'll be on my way now 
 And I'll be moving way up, way up, way up 
 Out of your way 
 (Big Sean) 
 Man I wish that I could shoot her 
 I wish that I never knew her 
 Man what I'm suppose to do huh 
 She my backbone how I'm suppose to maneuver 
 And I know I said it last time, 
 But I swear last time was the last time 
 But now she say it's all past time 
 And I feel like I see my flat line 
 And I'm suppose to be a man and all 
 But when you get that involved 
 You got to thinking with your head 
 No, your real head not the one in your pants and all 
 Man she was suppose to be my baby 
 Man we was suppose to see our baby 
 Man I would've gave her everything 
 Better life, wedding ring, everything we never seen 
 I guess we'll never see it now 
 (Mr. Hudson) 
 Nothing left to say now 
 I'll be on my way now 
 I'll be moving way up, way up, way up 
 There's nothing left to say now 
 I'll be on my way now 
 And I'll be moving way up, way up, way up 
 Out of your way 
 (Big Sean) 
 Man I wish that I could stab her 
 Remember when I used to grab her 
 I wish a nigga still had her 
 It's gone hurt to see another nigga have her 
 When I call there's no answer 
 And she ain't love Big Sean she loves Sean Anderson 
 Man you could probably feel me dying 
 And you could probably hear her crying 
 She killing me from the inside out 
 Took everything in the crib that was inside out 
 She priceless, and I can't afford it 
 You want space baby I'll give you all of it 
 So come home, home is where the heart is 
 She say whenever I'm here I feel heartless 
 So it's time to part then 
 I beg you pardon? 
 We'll be back tomorrow, no 
 (Mr. Hudson) 
 Nothing left to say now 
 I'll be on my way now 
 I'll be moving way up, way up, way up 
 There's nothing left to say now 
 I'll be on my way now 
 And I'll be moving way up, way up, way up 
 Out of your way
