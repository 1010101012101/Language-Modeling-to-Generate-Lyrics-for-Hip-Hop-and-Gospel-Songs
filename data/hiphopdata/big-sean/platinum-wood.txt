Come roll with a nigga, get high with a nigga 
 Count stacks with a nigga, fuck hoes with a nigga 
 Back in high school we used to trade clothes with my niggas 
 Back when Icebreaker and Girbaud was like the wardrobe for the killers, we pose for the pictures 
 Stunting on hoes, I stunt with my bros 
 Real go-getters, I swear being broke didn't fit us 
 Like new T-shirts, new jeans, new hats 
 You know, spending gas money on everything except gas 
 Spending my last on the shit that won't last 
 Back when 20 dollars would impress that ass 
 A movie and popcorn and caress that ass 
 Overdress and undress that ass, god bless that ass 
 It was me and my dawgs, summer on summer 
 Riding around like we dumber on dumber 
 Whipping that Toyota like it's a Hummer 
 What happened to those days? I really do wonder 
 When all I did was safe sex, latex 
 The first time I slipped up, wished I had a homemade aids test fuck 
 But I ain't flunk once 
 Back before I got drunk once 
 I was smoking on haze, all in a daze 
 My homies would call and say "nigga, come roll" 
 Man, I'm straight up off the 7 Mile 
 They call that the better mile 
 Tryna get a house up in the woods 
 Off on 11 Mile, better that, one time for the D 
 Girls that hold me down Corretta style 
 And everything I want off in the world is a must-have 
 I realised that at the bus stop with a bus pass thinking "fuck rap" 
 Cause there's niggas in the streets getting money under my nose that I mustache 
 I've seen people get murdered who ain't deserved that shit 
 Cops should've protect-and-served and shit 
 But still pull me over, disrespect and search my shit 
 That's why their attitude was "bitch, you deserved that shit" 
 Bang bang bang, how do you maintain the same brain and mind 
 In a city of AKs and K9s 
 When only language they know English and gang signs 
 Fuck it all though, I'm repping till the world blow, come roll 
 Sean, it's good to be home, isn't it?
