Feeling like I got the cheat code to life 
 Jewelry looking like it got free throwed in ice 
 Debatin' with the reaper not to repo my life 
 Cause in my 23 years I done lived a couple lives 
 Like why? 'cause I stunt, bags of trees, like its fall 
 The girls that was outta my league tryna play with my balls 
 I pay bills, I work hard 
 And when my momma cried a river, they never gave us a bridge 
 They gave us a bridge card, nigga 
 Ridin' low, puffin on lye 
 I came way too far to f-ck it up now 
 Text from my mom said "me and your grandma proud" 
 I'm way too deep in the game to go sit back in the crowd 
 Teacher told me get a job, save up for a 401 (k) 
 Man I'd rather be young and shit, countin' $401k. 
 I'd rather die with a smile instead 
 I'm just multiplying the money and dividing the legs 
 B-I 
 (Been this way before) 
 (Dream of finding so much more) 
 But I'm never dividing the bread 
 Bitch I bet I get the debit if I don't get the cred (I deserve) 
 Throwin' westside up like Pac, when they pop ya block up, 
 Big Poppa flock off, you holy lil ? holy Kenobi, chewbacca 
 I'm Balenciaga, Chanel, Hermes but I betchu that you won't find it 
 Rocking Louie and MC'ing 
 Guess I'm closed (clothes) minded 
 Obama suite, you one below, up in the Joe Biden 
 I'm in your city just chillin', where are your hoes hiding? 
 24k for the fit because it's 24 carats 
 And I can't lie, the price'll probably go up when I wear it 
 I'm just D-Town reppin' 
 And makin' all these niggas who second guessed it regret it 
 Regret it like half the hoes I smashed in the sheets 
 At least I realise now how much I loved Ashlee Marie 
 And when it's all said and done I'd probably give her my knee 
 'Cause she put up with too many games not to have her a ring 
 Man she almost cried when she seen me on TV on BET 
 Just making it seem easy 
 Standing next to Common Sense and Yeezy 
 And the whole world's seen me 
 Bitch I know you seen me 
 (Been this way before) 
 (Dream of finding so much more) 
 "Man, I wake up to a wet dream 
 Everyday's a Friday and every nights a sex scene 
 Every week is fashion week and every day I'm pressed clean 
 Detroit's Angel, I even got red wings 
 I'm headed to the ball, me and three prom queens 
 My life's prom night and guess who the Prom King 
 They having a kissing fight and I'm Don King 
 Everybody know I'm coming soon like LeBron's ring" 
 You tell me that wasn't verse of the year 
 Man that shit deserves a hearse and a tear 
 Swear to God I'm overlaid, all my girls get overf-cked 
 All my deals be overpaid and all my joints get over stuffed 
 Finally Famous bitch, there ain't a f-cking thing that's over us 
 So take that check out and owe it up 
 Man I turned impossible possible 
 And what these niggas can barely see in the optical 
 The same teacher who told me rappin' is what not to do 
 Said I'm throwin' my life away if I drop outta school 
 Want me to come speak to the kids, the point I gotta prove 
 Is that I did everything they told me not to do 
 After I went down the road, they told me not to cruise 
 They ain't know that was my road to success 
 Now my picture on the wall hanging to help the kids follow through 
 My dream girl is every night, my dream car is optional 
 My old school look like a T-Rex, I should feed her fossil fuels 
 Man, I turn my enemies to molecules 
 Little hoes 
 Without any preparation, I exceed these expectations 
 Man, they wanna see me dead, but I gave them dedication 
 I'm yellin' f-ck 'em all, with a hundred exclamations 
 'Cause I'mma be the man till my f-cking expiration 
 B-I-G, I do it 
 This goes out to my muthaf-cking city 
 Detroit, Westside to be exact 
 Right over there on Northline...
