[I stand alone in my four conner room, 
 Staring at candles. (mannn is this shit on) ] 
 Yeah, aye, aye-o at night I can't sleep, 
 I toss and turn, I get lost for words, 
 It's like I lost my nerves, 
 It all started with my chick about a b**** that I hit, 
 That I swear ain't s***, 
 But she swear I ain't s***. 
 Awww man lord help her she can't see what I'm sayin' 
 Or hear what I tell her, 
 It feel like I'm talking to helen, keller 
 I wish that she could understand me, 
 Like a shelter, 
 I called her up and said I'm tired of beefin' told her I'm leavin' 
 And that she's not needed, 
 She said oh so you just done with us, I love 
 You doe, yeah well that makes one of us 
 I hung up. 
 I got tired of my living 
 Room decor then headed to the liqour 
 Store to get liqour, swishor and a stickor, 
 And then pull a lift off, till I buzz like clipors 
 And pose like a clip board, I then go 
 Somewhere I had no buisnees. 
 Er'body hands up so it wasn't the question. 
 I started to dippin', 
 It take a man with a wooden 
 Cane in the air to reconize a stick up. 
 Hell yeah the ni***s tried to hit me, 
 But off a whole round swear to god they just missed me, 
 Then the police sirens are wrong. 
 They took what they saw then went out the back door. 
 Shit I hoped off the floor tryna see which way they went. 
 Mad then a motherfuckin' b****. 
 Walked back in to make sure er'thang was cool. 
 Looked on the floor saw blood by the pool. 
 So I asked the clerk dude what's the trouble. 
 No response. 
 But his face seemed puzzled. 
 I walked towards the huddle to the front of the crowd... 
 And that's when I saw myself strecthed out. 
 See it wasn't till I say my own body, 
 Then I realized them pussy ni***s shot me (man) 
 Man I couldn't even tell my b**** I love ha, 
 Man I couldn't even kiss my mother. 
 Ain't that some s*** homie? 
 My mind is playin' tricks on me...
