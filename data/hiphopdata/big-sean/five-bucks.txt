I'm smokin' loudly, I woke them all 
 I pick up that tree, when it's not far 
 I'm gone off that tree, when it's not tall 
 I'm in love with tree, I'm a avatar 
 I pick up a o from my nigga ralphie 
 My bro and me but he is not alfie 
 Gone off that goo punch, it makes me drowsy 
 Roll up the windows, it makes it cloudy 
 Daaamn if you ain't know 
 I make these girls nice smokin' paper and bows 
 My ladies like blunts, hit 'em twice if not once 
 Then I blow 'em off and just pass 'em to my bro 
 Now catch me gettin' brain if a nigga not learnin 
 I be spendin money if a nigga not earnin 
 Catch me in the back seat if I'm not stirrin 
 And I be rollin' up if a nigga not burnin 
 I got 5 on it 
 (Got it good) 
 Grab your fo', let's get keyed 
 I got 5 on it 
 Messin' with that endo weed 
 I got 5 on it 
 (Got it good) 
 It's got me stuck, cannot go back 
 I got 5 on it 
 Potnah, let's go half on a sack 
 You know a nigga like to stay up at that cruisin altitude up in the sky 
 Try to fuck with paper planes but it's not the same high 
 Cleveland niggas ain't no bitches we prefer the cigarello smoke 
 If you say it take away from taste then get some better smoke 
 'Cause the shit I blow can be smoked on the next block 
 Ain't no middle man everything you need is in stock 
 This glock is all the security I need 
 I be solo dolo when you see me blowin' on some weed 
 Why speed? no need I be just takin' it slow 
 I be so clean diesel overpowers my cologne 
 Now all the bad bitches who blaze are shiftin this way 
 Y'all just some white doves with these leaves I am the sensei 
 Now bow to the bag, never save the best for last 
 When I come around niggas know to hurry up and pass 
 Fuck a dime set lets cop a quarter pound 
 What the fuck is you gonna put down 
 Nigga I got five 
 I got 5 on it 
 (Got it good) 
 Grab your fo', let's get keyed 
 I got 5 on it 
 Messin' with that endo weed 
 I got 5 on it 
 (Got it good) 
 It's got me stuck, cannot go back 
 I got 5 on it 
 Potnah, let's go half on a sack 
 Hot wired 6?4 hydraulics 
 Not stolen lost my keys I was high patna 
 Fuck you want this a raw paper 
 Not a blunt you must got me mixed up with chip 'cause 
 This spitta zig zag a whole zip up 
 Shit strong shoulda came with a big pick up 
 Bitches callin me wanna smoke beggin for me to pick her up 
 She blow me while I'm blowin' rings of that killa 
 That weed you smokin' brown 
 Fake weed too much makeup clown 
 Get real smoking green strawberry fields 
 High standin up feelin' like I'm layin down 
 Couple boojey judies came round 
 Actin' all stuck up 
 Now they just stuck from smoking with us 
 How the hallways smellin is my windows open enough 
 I hear walkie talkies is security comin' up? 
 I got 5 on it 
 (Got it good) 
 Grab your fo', let's get keyed 
 I got 5 on it 
 Messin' with that endo weed 
 I got 5 on it 
 (Got it good) 
 It's got me stuck, cannot go back 
 I got 5 on it 
 Potnah, let's go half on a sack
