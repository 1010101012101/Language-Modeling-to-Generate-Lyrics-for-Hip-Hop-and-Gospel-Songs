Chuck Inglish: 
 Yeah 
 And it's fallin' off the side like back fat 
 Givin' girls rides to the crib not a rat trap 
 Cheese, peanut butter freeze raps 
 I want all these snapped in it's back in the day 
 Like a tall tee tag 
 I need that whip clean G 
 What's the weather gon be? 
 Drop top, no drips on this upholstery 
 Supposed to be headed downtown 
 Carwash like blouw 
 Let my girl drive the chevy while I break this tree down 
 Roll the window back up 
 Good, turn it back up 
 Ugh, UGK 
 Diamonds and Wood 
 Hold up, yeah roll up 
 That's tight, that's right 
 You do this right, you might have the time of ya life 
 Dom Kennedy: 
 Comin' from the westside but my fitted say Sox 
 Where you get banged on if you in it or not 
 Lookin' like Cain 'cause I watch Menace a lot 
 And I'm tryna fuck yo friend so is she with it or not? 
 Shout out to ATL 'cause I'm in Lennox a lot 
 And I don't like lookin', I go in there to cop 
 Houston High Rollers, I go in it a lot 
 Spendin money with the strippers you go in there to watch 
 Blowin' on L's 
 Smellin like Chanel 
 You say you the man but dawg these bitches can't tell 
 But ladies love Dom 'cause I'm gettin' that mail 
 To make it out my hood is like to make it out of jail 
 Put the 10's up and start breakin out the 12's 
 Bet I have yo girlfriend shakin out her heels 
 We shakin all deals 
 And chasin all meals 
 I'm poppin' all over how you haters all feel? 
 Big Sean: 
 Smoke good

 Count money

 These lil niggas can't hang 
 Big shit poppin' bitch and big my first name 
 I'm a westsider, detroit player 
 Fuck around and I might bring back gators 
 Everyday I leave the crib with no money 
 And come back later with that muthafuckin paper 
 Finally famous over erything that's just how I feel bitch 
 They trying to stop my shine 
 They yellin' hit the kill switch 
 Wrong nigga to deal with 
 Less you doing a deal with 
 Grind hard, that's how I was built bitch 
 Whoa there. Whoa there 
 I'm who everybody know here 
 I come through in the club and get more money than promoters 
 Oh that's your girl? I see her at my show there 
 I be off in the hood I bet you don't ever go there 
 Ay so slow there boy 
 Don't go there boy 
 Its people you don't know there boy 
 Young nigga that's addicted to the Polaroids 
 And I gave these niggas more lines than Corduroy 
 And my bitches be gorgeous boy 
 Showtime I hope you recordin boy 
 I'm out here 
 Boldy James: 
 Lets re-up half of a brick nd 
 Bring it back to the kitchen 
 See the crack as its fizzin 
 Then bring it back when its finished 
 Jimbo put that in addition 
 And Chizzel will bag it and seal it 
 Then Boldy factored a did 
 To know the cash that I'm flippin

 6 o's in traffic

 And that one get split and het broke into halves 
 And this one his o

 And this o I'm baggin 
 And this one 
 This o the last 
 The nigga Ro is a crack-a-matician 
 Rollin' the ave 'cause I'm gettin' dough in that slab 
 'Cause I'm gettin' over, they mad 
 I just grill a blow with my mag with my briches 
 Know I'll blast if you tempt him 
 Bro you will crash in yo whip with holes in yo back 'cause you hit 
 Goin' as fast as yo engine go when you smash in the strip smokin' a bag wit yo bitch 
 Chokin, gaspin for breath holdin', grabbin yo chest from Boldy maggin that tech 
 Unload it faster than Vick's concrete school craft to the the sick 
 Bomb as a brick 
 Asher Roth: 
 I be frustrated with the way that shit's been agein 
 I'm about to take a break and get away on a vacation 
 Like, maybe Malaysia to escape the meditation 
 I'll just eat, pray and wait for my day of revelation or I'll 
 Take peyote, roam the rivers of Nairobi 
 Change my name to Navajo and live alone and only blow weed 
 'Cause this? Naomi flowin show gets pretty lonely 
 Don't nobody ever know you 
 Everybody call you homie so 
 Moany Moany they'll be sure to treat you phony and 
 As soon as you hit your low they won't be pickin' up the phone 
 See, I'm moved to Coney show these fools that I am home 
 And when I'm on the microphone all you wanna-be's can roam 
 So, take this boner to the dome you little bo-peeps 
 That may be inapropy but I'm certainly no sheep 
 See, I only lead in this game of entertainment 
 Roth and Big Sean 
 We on 
 Finally Famous 
 Chip Tha Ripper: 
 Yeah, now roll 10 of 'em up 
 Fuck the rules we Indians pretzel bendin 'em up 
 Don't give a fuck 
 Word to yo daddy leather sandals 
 Either pay the light bill or light up them candles 
 Regular White Owl 
 Cigarillo no flavors 
 Break that bitch down and peel of the first layer 
 Smooth 
 Like a baby's ass 
 Mercedes pass 
 The ladies ask can they be next 'cause I'm kickin they favorite raps 
 Life is playin' 2k and kickin raps all day by the lake 
 Smokin' tree till I collapse in broad day 
 I'm surfin 
 Radical 
 Narly 
 Far out 
 My stoner chicks gather round soon as I break the jar out 
 Ay baby girl pass the blizz-ard 
 Yo woman chose me so I had to jizz her 
 Don't be sleepin' or takin' no cat naps 
 We leaders of the new school with these fat raps
