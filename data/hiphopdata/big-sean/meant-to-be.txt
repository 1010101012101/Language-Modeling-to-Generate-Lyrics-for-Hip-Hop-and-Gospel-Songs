(Big Sean - Chorus) 
 Yeah this was meant to be 
 I came in the world knowing nothing was for free 
 So you gon pay for her and she gon pay for me 
 My life is the sh-t I guess that this was meant for me 
 (Repeated) 
 Tell a b-tch to tell her friend 
 To tell her friend to tell a hoe 
 I have been the realest since the doc cut umbilical 
 Hundred inch d-ck yep and twenty pound genitals 
 So you gon have to stay there till my (?) 
 Tell a b-tch to tell friend to friend to tell a hoe [Repeat 3X]

 (Big Sean - Verse 1) 
 Stack that paper 
 Stack it stack it stack it up some more 
 Give me everything I want then I'm asking for some more 
 I'm smoking up on that tropical charlie green yeah jalapagos 
 Rainbow chain on my necklace look like a pot of gold 
 I know these girls tryna no jumping off Jeronimo 
 They tell me I'm the best and I ain't even trying hoe 
 See me I'm into hoes that's into hoes 
 So now I'm in two hoes, real sh-t boy 
 You don't drink, more for me 
 We chillin' out with n-ggas can't afford to be 
 Look baby girl you better act accordingly 'cause I see bout 10 more of you but sorry there's no more of me 
 (Big Sean - Verse 2) 
 Ca-ca-ca-catch me if you can 
 'Cause I might go from plane to whips 
 'Cause money is hand to hand 
 And I be shining neck to wrist 
 And your girl want mouth to mouth 
 And I make her get neck to d-ck 
 'Cause she just want connections with a n-gga that's connected 
 B-tch, I'm who they want be, want see, want see 
 Used to tell me everything I want be 
 You gon be, f-cking with piranha's and they want eat 
 But somehow I just turn the tide like laundry 
 Ooh, and now my life is beautiful 
 I'm a boss b-tch you should come and grab a cubicle 
 Look and I remain until my funeral 
 Stand up n-gga like I'm in front of the urinal 
 (Big Sean - Chorus)
