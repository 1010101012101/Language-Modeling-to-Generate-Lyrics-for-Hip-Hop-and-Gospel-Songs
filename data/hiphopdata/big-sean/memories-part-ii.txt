(Verse 1: Big Sean) 
 Sometimes I dream bigger than I live 
 Sometimes I think better when I'm lit 
 So goin' and light it 
 Roll it up, ignite it 
 One time for all my niggas that dreamed it than real life'd it! 
 I swear I've been through everything in life but a coffin 
 They say the sky's the limit, how bitch? I'm moonwalking! 
 And my middle name Michael ho 
 Success is my idol and being broke is my rival 
 But it's cool because I got the title ho 
 See I just want my fantasies in real life 
 You got everything tell me what it feel like 
 Muthafuck the radio if I can't hear mine 
 They give the wrong people more airtime than airlines 
 Is you feeling me? 
 If not you feel my energy 
 See I know I'm a make it, but even if I don't 
 Don't feel bad cause honestly all the times that I had 
 Those will be the best memories 
 Be the best memories 
 I hope that you remember me 
 These will be the best memories 
 Cause in the end all you really have is memories

 Let's reminisce over the good times and the bad 
 Reflect on everything we missed 
 Cause you know we'll never get it back 
 (Verse 2: Big Sean) 
 Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love 
 Or lose your girlfirend to groupie love 
 Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs 
 That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug 
 How many trends you gotta set till you considered great 
 How many missed calls till you considered fake 
 How many dreams till it's considered fate 
 I'm eating in a World where I'm considered bait 
 A workaholic addicted to bills 
 People addicted to me 'cause they addicted to real 
 My best friend got addicted to pills 
 I can't look at him in his eyes, you don't know how that shit feels mentally! 
 I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say "in memory" 
 I'm praying that he make, wishing we could go back 
 Cause honestly all the times that we had 
 Those be the best memories...

 (Verse 3: Big Sean) 
 Sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed 
 Was mailed one when I heard Nique had died in that crash 
 Seemed like yesterday I just seen him smile and laugh 
 I'm stressing over little shit 
 When I should be happy I can 
 They say my music beating, 'cause I follow my heart 
 I always have faith, like who swallows the darts 
 And with my Mama looking at cribs that we can't purchase 
 Houses bigger than a palace 
 But she a queen, so she deserve it 
 So I'm focused, they try to throw me off track 
 But they just hurdles 
 I'm marathoning to the money and you just running off in a circle 
 Man, I'm huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle 
 Fast forward a few years later 
 Now we the fucking winner's circle 
 Remember the first time I was rhyming for Kan' 
 Almost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom 
 Sold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect 
 But I already dreamed it 
 So it felt like I rehearsed it 
 Much as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed 
 Sad I used to steal Twenty Dollar bills right out her purses 
 No I ain't perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse 
 Life out of a hearse 
 And if I die, of course I have the memories...
