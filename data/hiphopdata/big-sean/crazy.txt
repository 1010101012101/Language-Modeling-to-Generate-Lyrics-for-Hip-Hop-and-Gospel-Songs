Man I should've known, should've known, should've known 
 Should've known, should've known 
 Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker 
 (Crazy, crazy, crazy) 
 She was crazy than a muthafucker 
 Man I should've known, should've known, should've known 
 Should've known, should've known 
 Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker 
 (Crazy, crazy, crazy) 
 She was crazy than a muthafucker 
 And God damn you all crazy ass 
 Wanna smash my Mercedes ass 
 Pokin' holes off in the condoms tryna have a baby ass 
 All up in Saks 5th when you deserve Macy's ass 
 Talkin' bout shit, yeah nigga, better pay me ass 
 Bitch all up in my house and I ain't tryna room mate her 
 She in and out my drawers like its, like it's Room Raiders 
 She crazy and deranged, when she in the Range 
 Skip the jewelry store and grab rocks 
 Like she Tomb Raider (raider, raider) 
 But before you hit that Alter 
 And the preacher start pronouncin' 
 Gave her half your heart but she got half of your amount 
 Of whatever's in your account 
 So take that into account 
 And you best get to countin' 
 Before you gets to bouncin' 
 Bitch 
 Man I should've known, should've known, should've known 
 Should've known, should've known 
 Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker 
 (Crazy, crazy, crazy) 
 She was crazy than a muthafucker 
 Man I should've known, should've known, should've known 
 Should've known, should've known 
 Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker 
 (Crazy, crazy, crazy) 
 She was crazy than a muthafucker 
 Crazy, man I must be crazy too 
 'Cause crazy as she is I could'nt leave her if ya paid me to 
 I swear I goes to work on that pussy like she paid me to 
 D-d-dick her up and now she walkin' like she 82 
 (I like the you you do it) 
 She get it from her mama 
 Headaches every night a nigga get it from the drama 
 Man if she don't make that money, she gon' take that money 
 Not from you, yeah she get it from your Honor 
 Believe that, fuck you get my password? 
 Readin' through my emails and you ain't even ask first 
 I know I should leave her 
 For damn sure don't, don't need her 
 Everytime I try and hit the door I always hit that ass first 
 Man I should've known, should've known, should've known 
 Should've known, should've known 
 Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker 
 (Crazy, crazy, crazy) 
 She was crazy than a muthafucker 
 Man I should've known, should've known, should've known 
 Should've known, should've known 
 Should've known that she was crazy than a muthafucker
