You want my shoes? You want my shirt? My jewels too, n-gga? 
 Well you need to 
 Go 'n' getcha some, go go 'n' getcha some (x4) 
 FRESH, fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic 
 Polo, Louis to Gucci, like that's one fresh jacket 
 They lookin' at a n-gga, like that's one fresh bastard 
 I'm rich, bitch, see the shit that this cash get 
 You can't afford the price, so why the hell would you ask it? 
 These faggots tried to snatch it, get their ass in a casket 
 Ya honey love me, she admire the fashion, & 
 I call her baby girl, just like her dad did 
 There's 100s on my paper like a smart ass class kid 
 Because I'm on top my rap, like an ad lib 
 And you should holler mama, Dolce and Gabbana mama 
 Gotta whole lot o mama, Fendi and a Prada 
 So you need to 
 Go 'n' getcha some', go go 'n' getcha some (x2) 
 But to get that boy, you got to be rich, or sum 
 And my attire, hard, hard like my dick or sum 
 I make more than ends meet, 
 My nigga Big told me it was 'bout the Benji's 
 I'm in the limelight, till the point my skin green 
 Livin' my dreams, till the point you should pinch me 
 To convince me

 Just to pronounce it, you gotta add an accent 
 And they askin can they call me grocery store, 'cause my pockets full of paper and plastic 
 Man, you not avoiding my Asian, persuasion 
 Excuse the lil' Ape in ya face, it stays Bathing 
 And when the heat blaze on high beams, you scream, I scream 
 For some cold ass ice cream

 Go 'n' getcha some, go go 'n' getcha some (x2) 
 These brawds really thinkin', that they gon get em' sum, 
 So they try to take care of me, like I'm sick or sum 
 There's some things, I don't like, I love them Nikes 
 But not the white on whites, forget the price tags 
 'Cause I get what I like, & you're girl lookin' for me 
 Because she like the pipe, ya digg

 The fabric on my ass is satin and its sad n 
 You think you could afford this fabric 
 When it comes to the hoes all the man like shaft this 
 'Cause I'm clean cut and handle them like baggage 
 Atheists turn Christian when I rock my True Religions 
 It's that real when I'm rockin' pastel 
 These n-ggas wanna wonder what they have on me 
 I'm stickin to my roots like LRG 
 So you need to 
 Go 'n' getcha some, go go 'n' getcha some (x2) 
 Pose for the hoes they might wanna take a pic or somethin' 
 Hop up in the ride they might wanna let me stick 'em some 
 The rag 'round my neck complement the outfit

 But Imma need money power respect 
 Find a little piece of Jesus and I threw 'em round my neck that's
