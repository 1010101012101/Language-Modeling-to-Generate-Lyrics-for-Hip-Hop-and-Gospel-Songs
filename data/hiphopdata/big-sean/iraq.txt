Iraq in this bitch, Iraq 
 I turn the club to 
 Iraq in this bitch x2 
 One call 
 Iraq in this bitch x3 
 Better get on 
 Iraq in this bitch 
 Iraq in this bitch, Iraq 
 You better get on 
 Iraq in this bitch x3 
 (Big Sean) 
 Now why why why 
 Would you compare me to you 
 If you think we're equal 
 Then bitch you are remedial 
 Remember who you're speaking to 
 Call it egotistical 
 But I am one of one 
 Yup and there is not a sequel, sequel 
 Soon as I approach in 
 Please do not approach him 
 Or you will need a little more than Ibuprofen B.I.G. 
 Please try and test us 
 One hand gesture 
 We'll fill they ass with lead like standardized testin, testin 
 And you already know where I live 
 How could I make it out that bitch being a bitch 
 (I know) I'ma drink glass after glass 
 (I know) I tend to act for ass over ass 
 Better stack I'll make your bitch come over 
 There's diamonds on deck like a nigger playin' poker 
 I hear them niggas talkin' but all they do is look 
 See to you I'm Mr. Big but to him I'm Mr. Bush 
 Bitch look bitch
