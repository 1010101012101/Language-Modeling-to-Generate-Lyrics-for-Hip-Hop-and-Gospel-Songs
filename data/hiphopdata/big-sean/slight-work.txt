Got work (slight work) 
 D-Town to the DMV 
 Diplo wassup 
 Finally got your girl going crazy 
 Drunk white bitches (work it, wo-wo-work it, oh) 
 I can do it all and it ain't no problem 
 Ain't nobody harder than a nigga Folarin 
 Bitch I go hard, I'm ballin' I'm globe trotting 
 And my flow art my nigga, I'm Mozart with it 
 It's all good, I do this 
 I turn a straight prude bitch into a nudist 
 Foolish I be on that new shit 
 And I'm blowing up like bitches we went to school with 
 Ain't nobody checking for your garbage 
 Lot of intuition I ain't even finish college 
 Never hit the mall and forever get it all 
 Any broad better layer like I'm dressing for the fall, nigga 
 And I'm all that, hit the passenger door 
 Shawty was Pinkberry sweet and I ain't lactose 
 I ain't tryna brag tho, I'm just know I'm that dope 
 Kick game Bo Jacks, my Bo Jacks Tai bo 
 Haha, and it ain't no problem, you race to these broads 
 I relay 'em, baton 'em 
 Bitches in here, one thou 
 But when you step out why the bitches run out 
 Double MG shit I put the set down 
 Rick James back, bad bitches on the couch 
 Ah, wordplay, Olubowale my first name 
 I think I'm Koko B. wearin, you just a bird babe 
 I got a pair of J's, I roll a pair of J's 
 We up in Diamond supply, spending that carrot cake 
 Let it marinate, you forever late 
 A million home sellers couldn't find a realer state 
 (Work it, work it) slight work, its light work 
 (Work it, work it) The wrong drink, the right work 
 Slight work, light work (Work it, work it) 
 The wrong drink, the right work 
 Work, work, work, work 
 Work, work, work, work 
 Work, work, work, work 
 Work, work, work, work 
 Bitch you ain't a boss till you cut a pay check 
 Only thing between me and your bitch is latex 
 Man, and I ain't into saving these hoes 
 My nigga tell me where you see a cape at 
 B-I, B-I bitch B-I-G 
 The two things I don't need are you and my ID 
 I'mma need a yellow cab and a yellow bad bitch 
 Green faces but a nigga dodging yellow badges, wooop (sirens) 
 'Cause I'm drunk, yeah ok 
 Under twenty five living the fucking life 
 White America said I'll be doing twenty five to life 
 And just for that, I'ma blow twenty five tonight 
 You make twenty five a year, I make twenty five a night, whoa 
 Blucka, blucka, blucka 
 Bitch get hit with my Ciroc Vodka choppa 
 (Go) takin' body shots, blocka, blocka, blocka 
 Probably in your girls dreams, probably in your daughter locker 
 Top floor like I'm out tanning 
 And they stole your whole delivery, now that's outlandish 
 I guess like good delivery, man, I'm outstanding 
 Car tinted, I'm in it, till like I'm out camping, goddammit 
 I'm one hell of a guy, looking down on a cloud, that's one hell of a high 
 Bitch, I gets ghost, the way she screaming Big 
 Niggas couldn't tell if I was dead or alive 
 You already know, Finally Famous in this
