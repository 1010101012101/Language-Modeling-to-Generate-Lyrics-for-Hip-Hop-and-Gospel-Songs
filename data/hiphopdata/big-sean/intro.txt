Yeah 
 Finally famous in this 
 Yeah 
 Do I really need an intro 
 Cause dey know, dey know, dey know 
 Do I really need an intro 
 Who I am, Who I am, Who I am 
 Do I really need an intro 
 Dey know, dey know, dey know 
 Do I really need an intro 
 Who I am, Who I am, Who I am 
 All I get is respect, as soon as I eject the vehicle 
 I bet you cannot detect, the scratch of a defect 
 From where the streets feast at, but made it out the belly of the beast without a C-sect 
 I'm so straight up, I'm so erect 
 Hype off that action, I'm so direct 
 I know it's a hundred thousand niggas up in Michigan 
 Doing it, but where I lack in talent I make up for it in discipline 
 And go hard, so hard till nobody else is on my sonar, radar, or lane 'cause I Bogart 
 Nowadays all we do is classic, Mozart 
 Outta here, it would be polite to send a postcard 
 I meant a post heart, y'all niggas post hard 
 So lost co-star, coast off au revoir 
 I mean look at all we been in 
 And I look up in the mirror like boy you ain't even finished 
 Do they really need my info, to show them what they in for 
 I'm recognized like kinfolk, even when my brim low 
 I come from where that life talk, where dat where dat knife talk 
 D-town, be brown, more money than white chalk 
 And on them nights how we grind till its light out 
 Grind till the sunset, till my grandson set, yup 
 Yeah, man my kids gone have the good life 
 Good days, good nights, and not the wish I could life 
 Strongest survive it, they see he trying to make something outta nothing 
 They like damn he Macgyver 
 Damn he go live, but too good to try and let up 
 And I'm better than whoever put together
