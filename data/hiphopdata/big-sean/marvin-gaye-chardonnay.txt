Early in the morning 
 When she's all alone 
 I'mma take my time 
 Do it how we want it 
 Just to set the mood, girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay 
 Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up 
 Yeah 
 She love the way I'm doing it 
 So GOOD she won't put my tattoo on it 
 Bottom line is, you the finest 
 Gave you a new name (what's that, what's that, what's that?) 
 My bitch 
 Hold up, hol' up, whoa there 
 Lets capture this moment if I ? than I own it 
 ? Want it every mornin' 
 And Patronin' girl, we grownin' 
 Waddup, got me feeling like a kid with the street lights on 
 Street lights on? 
 You know I got it going till it's... 
 Early in the morning 
 When she's all alone 
 I'mma take my time 
 Do it how we want it 
 Just to set the mood, girl I bought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay 
 Just let the song play 
 The long way 
 The strong way 
 It's our day 
 It's our way 
 This was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay 
 (Kanye West) 
 Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up, Hold up 
 Talk to the, talk to the hand 
 You talking to a grown ass man 
 It's like, way way way too much in your pants for us not to make the bed squeak 
 (There goes the bed sheets) 
 Err'ybody rip the swag off 
 'Fore I rip the tag off 
 Why my pants sag off, 'cause I'm rappin' my ass off 
 Flow so ugly, money so handsome 
 This the f-cking anthem, get it, the f-cking anthem 
 (Kanye West) 
 I don't really wanna uh... talk too much 
 But you love it when I talk like I lost it 
 And I love how you look when ya blazin' 
 And I swear you turn at least half asian 
 And we 'bout to have a liaison 
 She cool, get head with her shades on 
 You should just go and throw a cape on 
 And it's just so amazing 
 So amazing 
 So amazing 
 (Big Sean) 
 Take it to the car, bloop, bloop, that shit look like I'm speed racing 
 Leave 'em with me, it'll boost your reputation 
 Westside is where I'm stationed 
 Spend all night, just champagne tasting 
 Ain't no rest girl, lets just pace it till its... 
 And this was all inspired by a little Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay.
