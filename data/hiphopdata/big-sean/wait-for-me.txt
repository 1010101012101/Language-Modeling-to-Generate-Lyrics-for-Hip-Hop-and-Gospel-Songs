I hope it's not too late for me 
 Could you just wait for me a while 
 Is it too late, too late? 
 I hope it's not too late, too late (x2) 
 I hope it's not too late 
 I got my whole life packed inside a suitcase 
 Ridin' in a Chevy that should've been a Mercedez 
 Tryna keep my head above water 
 So I stayed out the navy 
 I, I, I made a promise to my girl 
 Said Imma leave town and bring back the whole world 
 So I bought a ticket 
 Took longer than expected 
 Came back around like a necklace 
 And the first thing she said, was (it's too late!) 
 Like nigga, I got needs too 
 I found a man who gave me what I need 
 Now I don't need ya 
 I barely gotta text the call back 
 You ol lying ass nigga 
 You're a dog 
 Out here chasin paper 
 Fuckin' bitches 
 Nah 
 Nah nigga you're too late 
 Live with it 
 Now you got a roommate 
 My homie served ten years 
 It's too late for him to be treated equally 
 Too late for him to make it out the hood legally 
 Ridin' around doing my thing 
 Is it too late to be tryin' to live dreams 
 Turn them up real 
 Reality is just a technicality 
 And so is being fake 
 So don't tell me that 
 I'm that I'm toooo late 
 I hope it's not too late for me 
 Could you just wait for me a while 
 Is it too late, too late? 
 I hope it's not too late, too late (x2) 
 Alarm clock said I'm too late 
 And they said I'm too weak 
 I could use a few weights 
 So they said I took too long 
 And don't look too strong 
 Well how long would you take 
 Waitin's got me here in the first place 
 Another second maybe second 
 Maybe third in the worst case 
 Now we'll display 
 On my word plays 
 Moving weight 
 It's such a trap 
 Move and weight 
 You can't do that 
 I know I'm dope man 
 But I can't move crack 
 And is such a fraction 
 They way you thinking about your plans 
 But I tryna bring it back 
 Before your brain hit the pan 
 Sean from Detroit 
 Lupe from Chicago land 
 But both of our chains say made in Japan 
 German engineers design both of the sedans 
 Ride with Mr. Right on time 
 Or stay Miss another chance, man 
 Re-direct it at the girls 
 Not an ultimatum 
 Just an option in this world 
 But things come and go 
 When the clocks never stop 
 Be on time for nothing 
 A little late for a lot 
 I hope it's not too late for me 
 Could you just wait for me a while 
 Is it too late, too late? 
 I hope it's not too late, too late (x2) 
 I hope it's not too late 
 I hope it's not too late 
 The last thing I wanna hear is too late 
 Tell me is it too late for me to try and change the world Is it too late to say I wanna change girls 
 Is it too late even though I'm the shit 
 Is it too late to tell y'all to suck my dick 
 (Talking) 
 Bitch 
 I do it too late for what 
 I want it I need it 
 If I need it I got it 
 Cause this how finally famous niggas do
