(Big Sean - Verse 1) 
 Sometimes I dream bigger than I live 
 Sometimes I think better when I'm lit 
 So go head and light it 
 Roll it up, ignite it 
 One time for all my n-ggas that dreamed it than real life'd it! 
 I swear I've been through everything in life but a coffin 
 They say sky's the limit, how b-tch? I'm moonwalking! 
 And my middle name Michael hoe 
 Success is my idol and being broke is my rival 
 But it's because I got the title hoe 
 See I just want my fantasies and real life 
 You got everything to me what it feel like 
 Muthaf-ck the radio if I can't hear mine 
 They give the wrong n-ggas more airtime than airlines 
 Is you feeling me? 
 If not you feel my energy 
 See I know I'mma make it, but even if I don't 
 Don't feel bad 'cause honestly all these times that I had 
 Those will be the best memories 
 Be the best memories 
 I hope that you remember me 
 These will be the best memories 
 Ooh oho ooh 
 'Cause in the end all you really have is memories 
 Ooh oho ooh 
 (Big Sean - Verse 2) 
 Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love 
 Or lose your girlfirend to groupie love 
 Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs 
 That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug 
 How many trends you gotta set before you considered great 
 How many missed calls before you considered fake 
 How many dreams before its considered fate 
 I'm eating in a World where I'm considered bait 
 A workaholic addicted to bills 
 People addicted to me 'cause they addicted to real 
 My best friend got addicted to pills 
 I can't look at him in his eyes, you don't know how that sh-t feels mentally! 
 I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say "in memory" 
 I'm praying that he make, wished we could go back 
 'Cause honestly all the times that we had 
 Those be the best memories...
