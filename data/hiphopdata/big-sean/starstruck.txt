Do it again and I'll see you tomorrow 
 I want to get it, you've got something to borrow 
 Give me, give me, right of my own 
 'Cause when I throw you on again 
 I buy it but it don't measure up 
 What is the missing ingredient? 
 I, I see you fade 
 I, I see you fade away 
 I, I see you fade 
 I, I see you fade away 
 Under the skin is not so easy to swallow 
 Don't rub me in, divide my dreams are so hollow 
 What is you get I don't get? I watch you fumblin' again 
 'Cause dream easy on your cigarette, through it, ain't through now 
 I, I see you fade 
 I, I see you fade away 
 I, I see you fade 
 I, I see you fade away 
 We all find new ways being so unhuman 
 Try and get two heads you are unhuman 
 Start trying 
 I, I see you fade 
 I, I see you fade away 
 I, I see you fade 
 I, I see you fade away
