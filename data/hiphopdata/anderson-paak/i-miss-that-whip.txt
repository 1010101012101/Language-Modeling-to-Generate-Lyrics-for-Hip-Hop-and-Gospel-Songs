I don't miss her one bit 
 Maybe a little bit 
 Some days I think about it 
 But I get over it real quick 
 It's too late to make amends 
 We can never be friends 
 I don't miss her one bit 
 I miss that whip 
 Damn, that whip 
 I miss that whip 
 That whip, that whip, that whip 
 I miss that whip 
 Look, she used to scoop from the train station 
 Half a smoothie and a rented movie, pre-rolled J waiting 
 (That whip, I miss that whip) 
 She didn't care about the reach 
 From De Longpre to Long Beach 
 (That whip, that whip, that whip 
 I miss that whip) 
 Damn, that whip 
 I miss that whip, that whip, that whip, that whip 
 I miss that whip
