I need the right one 
 With a bad imagination 
 Someone to talk to 
 Somebody patient 
 I want a cold piece 
 I want a love sensation 
 I want the my first 
 I make the body wait for it 
 You could be the right one 
 With a little dedication 
 Gotta make me follow through 
 Gotta make me chase it 
 Oh I want a stone groove 
 I want a love sensation 
 Somone to hold to 
 Someone to play with 
 'Cause lately 
 My whole being 
 Just wants what it needs 
 And I don't mind (I need it) 
 I want the right one 
 Car keys in the cake dish 
 Gotta take the pipe work 
 Gotta make me taste it 
 I mean amazing 
 You want my last name (say it) 
 Wanna have my babies 
 I'll take you all places 
 I want the world stage 
 A certified classic 
 Big planes 
 Light baggage 
 I gotta long reach 
 You got that good conversation 
 You're such a cold piece 
 I wonder if you're taken 
 'Cause lately 
 My whole being 
 Just wants what it needs 
 And I don't mind (I need it)
