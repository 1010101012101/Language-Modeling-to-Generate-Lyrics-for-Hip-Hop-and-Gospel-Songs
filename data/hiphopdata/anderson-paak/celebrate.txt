Time never cares if you're there or not there 
 All you ever needed was a simple plan 
 But you're doing well, I mean you're not dead 
 So let's celebrate while we still can 
 I know what they say, I could give or care 
 They talk so much on me, I must be doing something right 
 I saw my son today in the likeness of a full grown man 
 So I'll celebrate while I still can 
 Ooh, on a clear day you can see West L.A., even downtown 
 I remember when I couldn't even see the point 
 Of stepping out the motherfucking house 
 Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go 
 I came to (fixing up the tree I've come to) 
 Ooh, I came too far (the church, resting under the stars) 
 How many others have walked the same ground you have 
 You'll be wise to pay attention to your old head 
 I spent the whole day throwing records in the deep end 
 So let's celebrate while we still can 
 Captivated, the fruits of my family tree 
 Where would I be without you, what would you do without me 
 It'd be a bad look talkin' 'bout what could have been 
 So let's celebrate while we still can 
 Ooh, on a clear day you can see West LA, even downtown 
 I remember when I couldn't see the point 
 But now I'm at the point where I got it figured out now 
 Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go 
 I came to (fixing up the tree I've come to) 
 To (the church, resting under the stars) 
 Do not be concerned about the money in your brother's hand 
 What's mine is yours, I thought you knew me better than that 
 I was under the impression that we all want the best of life 
 So let's celebrate while we still can 
 The partnership of the, the board 
 And the body of the fellow that is doing the maneuvers 
 In the fluent directions with the, with this wave 
 Is what interests me 
 Now chaotic surfing, nervous surfing, and uh, uh 
 Surfing power, it has its, has its merits 
 And I, uh, I can, it fascinates me 
 That's just not my direction, I 
 I can only speak for myself
