I get the feelin' that ya might be (high) 
 Did I turn you on? You can tell me if I'm wrong 
 But I'm feelin' that ya might be (high) 
 And we ain't even smoke but you swear I got that dope 
 And I'm thinkin' you'd like to be (high) 
 Every word I speak got you floatin' off your seat 
 And I'm knowin' that you like me (high) 
 Oh you high baby, high baby 
 OK, the blunt is rolled up 
 Nobody lit it 
 Said even if we don't puff 
 Won't make a difference 
 My body's leaning to the right baby 
 You tell me go on and spend the night baby 
 No, I don't even know ya 
 I know enough to get you high baby 
 I got about a half an ounce of that tree 
 Got about a half a cup of that lean 
 I said go on and kick your feet up 
 I'mma go ahead and twist the weed up 
 She said, "Cool to say what I think?" 
 I said, "Go and do what you feel" 
 She said, "Bend me over that sink" 
 I said, "Damn, your wish is my will"

 Every word I speak got you floatin' off your seat 
 And I'm knowin' that you like me (high) 
 Oh you high baby, high baby 
 Okay, I feelin' so stuck 
 Laid up on the couch, got fingers in your mouth 
 Girl, Bring it closer 
 Before my high comes down 
 My high comes down 
 Girl, I can barely keep my eyes open 
 You say you tryna get your spine blown in 
 Though I don't even know ya 
 I know enough to get you high floatin' 
 I got about a half an ounce of that tree 
 Got about a half a cup of that lean 
 I said go on and kick your feet up 
 I'mma go ahead and twist the weed up 
 She said, "Cool to say what I think?" 
 I said, "Go and do what you feel"
