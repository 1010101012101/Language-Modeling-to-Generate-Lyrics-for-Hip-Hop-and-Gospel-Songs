Why the hell would you run this game? 
 Both my hands are tied 
 Afraid of thinking I dug my own grave 
 Fuck around with this 
 Strange and elusive, too afraid to lose it 
 I don't mind this pain 
 Most nigga's want you for your candy 
 They'll never know just how long it takes 
 I wave my own pride 
 And put it all on the line 
 There I go, volunteering, punish me 
 Self inflicted pain, (and sickness) over you 
 Way over you 
 Here I stay, time 'n' time 
 It must be what you put me through 
 It must be what you put me through 
 A little while longer 
 A bit more time 
 Why would you run these thoughts across my mind? 
 Please, relieve me 
 As cool as I remain 
 There's a point in which I'll lose my self restraint 
 Say, love, most niggas would've left you lonely 
 I fancy throwing it all away 
 I see it to my own demise 
 How much longer will I let it ride? 
 There I go, volunteering, punish me 
 Self inflicted pain, (?) over you 
 Way over you 
 Here I stay, time and time 
 It must be what you put me through 
 It must be what you put me through 
 It must be what you put me through 
 It must be what you put me through 
 It must be what you put me through
