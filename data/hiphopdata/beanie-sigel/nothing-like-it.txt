I'm just a picture in a frame 
 Man, I paint word pictures on the canvas of life 
 But I don't control the colors 
 Yo, I'm ten steps ahead of niggas, that shit scary 
 Sometimes I feel ahead of myself 
 I hear this voice in the back of my mind 
 Like "Mac maintain, just grind, dog, better yourself" 
 So what I do?, I take heed and pick up the pace 
 Can't explain it when I pick up my son and look at my face 
 I'm like a black rose growin' in the concrete crack in the pavement 
 There that voice go again "Mac practice for greatness, 
 Get paid for them immaculate statements" 
 Keep thinkin' of them hotlines, like a physic, I can't explain it 
 There's no pen when I write it, there's nothing like it... 
 God damn, what you want from me, what you want me to tell you huh? 
 Niggas thought that I would stutter huh, thought I was dumb 
 But I ain't used to use my mind, I used to just... use my 9 
 And run wild with my boys, in the streets wild with these wars 
 Now the Qu'ran and 48 laws, they polish my floors 
 I'm moving niggas like puppets with no strings attached 
 It's nothin' for Beans, so you know it ain't a thing for Mac 
 To look in your eyes, see through your heart, know what you fearin' 
 Pick you apart, like you niggas is transparent 
 (I see right through you niggas) 
 It's like Mac was born with advanced parents 
 I'm like the Sun shining at night, 
 Imagine it dog, I know you wanna see me gradually fall 
 But I'm walkin' on air, braking every gravity law 
 Nothing like it... 
 I spit words that skip through air 
 Let the words of a true thug hit your ear, 
 It change colors like blue blood when it hit the air 
 It's nothin' like it... 
 God damn, shit, I can't explain it 
 Fuck y'all niggas 
 I changed my whole life... in about 9 months, just like sperm in a womb 
 These young niggas never learn till they doomed 
 Try to tell them "you can burn young punk, without smelling the fuse" 
 Make you shiver in the middle of June, 
 Paintin' pictures so vivid, you can hang it up in your room 
 Shine bright like a prism, displaying colors like Crayola 
 Think of the prisons with straight soldiers 
 Think about the niggas who fucked us and played over us 
 Think about the mothers who suffered and prayed over us 
 Just look at the the picture I've painted, it's so perfect 
 Open your eyes motherfuckers, you can't duck us 
 No survivors every soul shall suffer, 
 I'm loadin them revolvers every shell shall touch ya 
 I promise I'll light your ass with these mags, I'ma bust ya 
 God damn it's nothin' like it, I'm serious 
 Can't explain how I write it...
