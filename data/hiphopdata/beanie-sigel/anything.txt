 Trade my life in for yours leave a steak up out the door me costa sue costa 
 Just remmeber to turn the lights on in the hall my brother from another pop 
 Minus one shot we running with g money man we all we got from the coop to the 
 Stoop the big dudes stoping us from playing hoops in us getting mad throwing 
 Rocks off the roof straight thuggin' man thought we would never progress but 
 Look at us now man shit we young excets my nigga big my nigga dam my nigga godi

 Never liking my girl that's how we run when you ain't around I spank your son 
 Give him a nine if you do die I keep him like mine God forbid you keep this in
