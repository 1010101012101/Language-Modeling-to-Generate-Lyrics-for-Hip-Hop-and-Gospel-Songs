 Who Get Screwed Up, My Thick Juice Sippers 
 Shout Out, To My Man Lil Flip

 (Verse 2: Bun B) 
 Way Back In 94 When Screw Still Had His Gate Up 
 He Called Me Over To His House and He Poured Me A 8 Up 
 I Asked Him What It Was He Said Bun Get Ya Weight Up 
 This Is Lean, Them White Folks Call It Promethazine 
 Shit But We Gonna Call It Drink Dawg 'Cause That's What We Be Doin' To It 
 Now Take This Big Red and Pour About A 2 Into It 
 I Said 2's & 8's, What The Fuck Is you Trippin' On? 
 He Said Man That's The Ounces Of Cough Syrup That you Sippin On 
 So Shit I Poured It I Sipped It, Then I Sipped Some Mo 
 I Fired Up A Green Monster, & I Hit That Ho 
 Started Relaxin, Shit and To My Surprise 
 I Was Noddin Off Lookin' At The Back Of My Eyes 
 They Tried To Wake Me Up But Shit I Just Kept Yawnin 
 I Fell Out Of My Chair and Woke Up There The Next Mornin 
 God Bless My Nigga, Cause Its Then I Been Spawned 
 On My White Muddy Cup of Texas Tea, That R
