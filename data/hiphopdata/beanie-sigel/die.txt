 Niggas in the struggle all out ta get paid 
 Doin' what we gotta do to avoid the raid 
 Before you get caged, but you can't avoid the grave 
 (Beanie Sigel) 
 When you live by the sword, you die by the sword 
 I'll probably die in the vocal booth spittin' out raw 
 Die on stage, rippin' down tours 
 Die from age, trickin' out-a-town whores 
 Die 'cause I didn't have one in the pipe 
 Might go out like Raymond, went out on his bike 
 And die on a death mission, two tec's spittin' 
 No vest section from my chest missin' 
 Die 'cause the jewels in my necklace glisten 
 In a V twizzy in a wreckless collision 
 Or die in the streets over somethin' petty 
 'Cause a broke ass nigga tryed ta say I assed bet 'em 
 Die from a shot from a cig war glock 
 >From a kid on the block while sittin' in the drop 
 Or die 'cause I was on, ain't see 'em comin' 
 Too late, eight shots got my body nummin' 
 Die for fuckin' his bitch in his bed 
 Die 'cause a nigga thought I snitched ta the feds 
 Die wit a knife six inches in my head 
 I could die on death row, sentenced to the chair 
 Or die 'cause a nigga pulled his Rosco out quicker 
 I was high off vodka, hydro, and malt liquor 
 Die 'cause I knew I shoulda laid that man 
 Die 'cause the cops tricked me ta say that man 
 Die 'cause I hesitated ta spray that man 
 Die 'cause I hesitated ta pay that man 
 Die 'cause my man passed me a empty tool 
 Die 'cause I panicked, I couldn't keep my cool 
 Die 'cause I mixed all them pills wit Hennessy 
 Or die 'cause them niggas in jail, envyed me 
 Die tryin' ta steal the fate of my enemy 
 I could go out from a case of mistaken identity 
 Or die 'cause the door wasn't open, it was locked 
 Die 'cause the 4 was broken, it wouldn't cock 
 Die 'cause a nigga wasn't focused on the block 
 Die 'cause them niggas thought tha coke was in the spot 
 Die 'cause another nigga said I said somethin' 
 Die 'cause that newsy bitch said I did somethin' 
 Die 'cause a nigga was tryin' ta get a name 
 Or die 'cause it was just my time ta feel the flame 
 Might get sparked, might not feel no pain 
 Or Might go out like dark-skinned Jermaine 
 Take a couple shots ta the heart, or ta the brain 
 Got all the dough, don't know the cost of the game 
 Young buck didn't wanna come off the chain 
 Couldn't handle the rock, got horsed in the game 
 I could catch a bad break like Big or Pac 
 I'd rather go out in the masjid makin' salott
