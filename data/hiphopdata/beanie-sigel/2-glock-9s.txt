 Yo ay yo you sure about that 
 You want to know about the MAC

 Blow through your front make it go outcha back 
 Ay yo I let fifty shots blow out the MAC 
 Dogg ain't nutin' slow about the MAC 
 And dogg ain't nutin' ho about the MAC 
 Man I come through with them heats 
 Come in a few jeeps 
 Like Phez come through in they suite 
 And you know how we play 
 When we poppin' them Glocks 
 Take it to the AK 
 Chopper the block 
 And to the S.W.A.T.'s 
 Helicopter the block 
 And them put you on the news 
 Wasn't proper to watch 
 You know I act like my clips I'm bananas 
 Catch me in your strip all black in bandanas

 So I can let this tar lift you off your feet like Vince Carter 
 Two Glock nines

 Oh I'm a motherfuckin' G nigga 
 Fuckin' with me

 Have a nigga clutchin' his knee 
 Strugglin' to breathe 
 Make the gat splatter your blatter 
 Like a kidney disease 
 Yeah I know you're holdin' weight 
 So just gimme the keys 
 Or these motherfuckers with you are fin to whitness ya bleed 
 Paramedics cuttin' ya jeans 
 Rippin' ya sleeves 
 Put your ass in a body bag, zip it and leave 
 Ain't no motherfucker do it like I do 
 You and your nigga runnin' up 
 Put two in him and two in you 
 I put a nigga at the bed like a child with the flu 
 Put hit out on that bucket and runnin' wild with your crew 
 Put this thang to your head 
 Put your brains on the roof 
 Here now we ain't the same 
 Why'alls is liars and we the truth 
 Now that you know the scoop 
 What you want to do nigga 
 He ain't makin' money on this corner too nigga 
 Why not 'cause I got 
 Two Glock nines 
 Any motherfucker whisperin about mine[x4]

 Put another two in your new blue dew rag 
 Nigga brag if you want to

 The nigga ain't fast well his ass is a goner 
 (Beanie Sigel) 
 Ay yo I keep two Glock nines 
 Niggas tryin' to watch mine 
 Tryin' to stop mine 
 See where I stock mine 
 But I pop mine 
 And I pop moms 
 And I don't pop 
 Throwin' cops where your block rhyme 
 (T.i.p.) 
 Say, a nigga tryin' me 
 He'll find me 
 Bustin' away a blind bee 
 With thirty niggas 
 And sixty triggas standin' behind me 
 The nine be cocked 
 And we are riding 
 Bustin' in them bushes where you are hiding 
 (Beanie Sigel) 
 Ay yo I got a hundred niggas 
 With a fuckin' hundred gats 
 Who want the shit 
 Where their motherfuckin' stomach at 
 Don't bitch when that eye be in you 
 And I'll take somethin' from you only god can give you 
 Two Glock nines 
 Any motherfucker whisperin about mine[x4]
