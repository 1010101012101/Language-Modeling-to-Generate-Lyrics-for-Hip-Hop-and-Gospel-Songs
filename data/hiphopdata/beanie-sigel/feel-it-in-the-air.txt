(Feat. Melissa) 
 (Talkin') 
 My Spider senses is tinglin 
 Feel somethin', got my radars up 
 Somethin' goin' on, I feel funny can't tell me nuttin different 
 My nose twitchin 
 Intuition settin in like steve vision 
 I still close my eyes, I still see visions 
 Still hear that voice in tha back of my mind 
 So what I do? I still take heathe, I still listen 
 I still paint that perfect picture, 
 I still shine bright like a prism 
 My words still skippin - through air 
 I know you can't, don't, wont get it 
 You n*ggas chose to ride that ship, sunk wit it 
 I'm still afloat, I ain't tha captain of tha yact but I'm on a boat 
 I ain't actin' what I'm not 
 Knowin' that I don't, you n*ggas actin' like you will but I know you won't, you won't 
 I read between tha lines of ya eyes to ya brows 
 Ya handshake ain't matchin' ya smile 
 Ill holla, you n*ggas foul 
 I can feel it in tha air 
 I can feel it in tha air 
 I can feel it in tha air 
 I can hear it in your voice 
 I can feel it in tha air 
 I sit alone in my 4 cornered room starin' at hammers 
 Ready to go bananas 
 2 vests on me, 2 techs, extra clips on me 
 I know my mind ain't playin' tricks on me 
 I ain't skitz hommie 
 Ain't no body drop a nick on me 
 It's like they tryna plot a set on me 
 I hear this voice in tha back of my mind like mack tighten up ya circle 
 Before they hurt you 
 Read they body language 
 85% communication non-verbal, 85% swear they know you 
 10% you know they story, man tha other 5... time'll show you, just know you 
 Then pull they strings, you tha puppet master 
 **** Them other bastards 
 Man watch who you puffin after 
 Play ya cards, go against all odds 
 Shoot for tha moon if you miss, you still amongst those stars 
 I can feel it in tha air 
 I can feel it in tha air 
 I can feel it in tha air (I ain't scared n*gga I ain't goin' no where) 
 I can hear it in your voice (can you feel me?) 
 I can feel it in tha air (can you feel me?) 
 Can you feel it, can you feel it floatin? 
 Without picture quotin, scriptures from revalation 
 Talk **** and got tha devil waitin 
 Body get stiff, so levitate 
 Why do I speak blasphemy? 
 Knowin' one day that he'll ask for me 
 Ask for my sins 
 No one'll feel his wrath for me 
 I go through it, so you wouldn't do it... after me 
 As for me 
 I'm still circlin tha block before I'm parkin 
 Not bitchin, I'm just still cautious 
 Same black parka, same uzzi, extra clips, still clappin wit that same larkin 
 Damn, I feel it in tha air, you not sincere 
 N*gga it ain't an us, or we, or ima thing 
 It's a good/bad karma thing 
 This a song man the honest sing 
 I swear I feel somethin' honestly 
 I can feel it in tha air 
 I can feel it in tha air 
 I can feel it in tha air 
 I can hear it in your voice 
 I can feel it in tha air
