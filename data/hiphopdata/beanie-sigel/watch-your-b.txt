As far as back as I can remember 
 I always wanted to be was a gangster 
 Watch your bitches! 
 Hey yo, I walks like a pimp, talks like a mack 
 Spit lobster and shrimp, you could tell by the hat 
 Gators and flavors, colors like Now and Laters 
 Split champagne wishes to bitches, trips to Vegas 
 Jot down numbers on small pieces of paper 
 I got ya, skate, watch these bitches catch the vapors 
 Breaks down doe over a hoe, spend my chips over a trick? 
 I don't rock no masquino shit, I don't know know labeled me no trick 
 Biatch! You should pay me for dick 
 All I'm gone do is fuck you crazy 
 Bust a couple nuts, get lazy, bust another nut, it's Swayze 
 Tell your ass don't page me, see you when I see you 
 You need doe for what? Wouldn't wanna be you 
 Yeah, I'm a break you off, after I stroke you off 
 When I break you off, bitch! That's when I broke you off 
 Tell your ass get lost, only thing I'm gonna pay for is to be the boss 
 Can't see me giving no skee's my cheese 
 Tell 'em like they tell Beans, I got four seeds to feed 
 Till I fuck you and some change fall out of your ass 
 (Watch your bitches) 
 Biatch! Ain't nothing changed, I'm all about the cash

 You know Mack pop fly bitch, no Jonny Gill 'round my bitch 
 Bye Bye bitch, fuck that red dress on 
 Get a head step on, speed on 'for you get peed on 
 When I piss, I don't miss, shit 
 Get mad, scratch your ass, and get glad 
 'For I, scratch your ass and get Glad-bags 
 Throw your shit out on the trash 
 B-Mack, pimp-slash, Hustla, muthafucka! 
 But, back to the script, when I'm twisted off that sip 
 You know my twist, Mack on that lick 
 On that super hero juice but could handle my cake 
 Quick to throw bags, zams, and cakes 
 Cocktails come banana and grape 
 Yellow and purple, everything mellow in your circle 
 Feeling like metal can't hurt, you got that pro meth 'itch 
 (Watch your bitches) 
 Keep a hoe in check quick off that pro meth shit

 I don't gotta play games and chase a hoe 
 Spend cheese, say please, and lace a hoe 
 Man, all my bitches know to suck me off and hit the door 
 Especially if I hit before, they know the routine, dick to jaw 
 I don't give a bitch shit but game and spit that like Rudy Raymoore 
 Man my whole squad play on tours 
 That's all we do is play on whores 
 That's up to you if you pay for yours 
 I might let 'em run around in the apartment 
 Just don't steal shit or spill shit on the carpet 
 You know the address, apartment 3F 
 Find you, fuck you, and flee, and my man Bleek next 
 Hey yo, I walks like a pimp, talks like a mack 
 Spit lobster and shrimp, you could tell by the hat 
 Gators and flavors, colors like Now and Laters
