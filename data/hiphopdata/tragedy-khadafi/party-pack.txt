I'm a poet, storyteller who's tellin' it 
 My raps cause lyrics that are relevant 
 I drop science that's highly medical 
 I think I stimulate because I'm so theoretical 
 (?) 
 And makin' mad money means more MoÃ«t 
 Rap renegade, vigilante who's visual 
 And you'll agree I'm one bad individual 
 Teenage type takin' the time to tear 
 Alternatin' a rhythm through your atmosphere 
 More fierce than Freddy when I'm on your function 
 My rap provide a smooth introduction 
 Live Motivator, Marley Marl is a mack 
 Party pack, party animal, this party is packed 
 Rhythmatical reciter, rap's a rapture 
 Rebel of the treble, MC Tragic capture 
 A party in a second, tape or record 
 It really doesn't matter 'cause I still get hectic 
 Renegade with rank, I'm equipped to wreck 
 Stimulatin' your system when I sit on your set 
 I'm just another person on the path to perfection 
 Slip syllables with a style in my selection 
 You never hear another who's as nice with the needle 
 I'm livin' large, I could never be little 
 Maintain your movement, relax and max 
 Enjoy yourself, this is a party pack 
 This is a party pack 
 Technician on the technique is in control 
 Manipulatin' your manoeuvre on your FM mode 
 Takin' the time to terminate a turntable 
 I knew my cousin Freddy Krueger since the cradle 
 Havoc is hype causin' 100% juice 
 I lick a lyric, let it go and let loose 
 Generate and alternate 'cause I'm a general troop 
 MC Trag and I'm down the the Juice Crew group 
 Like a prophet proceedin' a party with direction 
 Original, the proof is my complexion 
 Mad metaphor with more material 
 Rap renegade, Asiatic imperial 
 Superior speech when the syllable slips 
 I'm a smooth narrator, never nondescript 
 He's the wizard at work when he's sweatin' the wax 
 (Believe that) This is a party pack 
 This is party pack 
 I detonate the dance floor puttin' rhymes in your direction 
 Select and direct with a style in my selection 
 Composed, conducted by the king of cut 
 This beat is kinda brutal so just move your butt 
 With the speech spontaneous for all spectators 
 Mentally mad 'cause I'm the live motivator 
 Rebel and writer, recite the recital 
 Rap veteran, vigilante who's vital 
 The depth that I drop goes past the devil 
 Lab technician on a synthesized level 
 Expose and express with poetic emotion 
 Deadly to your function, rap devotion 
 Better than the average MC, ya heard? 
 'Cause the Trag gets busy and that's my word 
 This is a party pack
