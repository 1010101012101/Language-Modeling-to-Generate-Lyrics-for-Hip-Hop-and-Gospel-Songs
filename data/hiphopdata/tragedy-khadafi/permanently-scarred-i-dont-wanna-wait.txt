(Talking) 
 Ma this song is for you... 'cause I love you 
 My tears fall on the paper as I write this ryme 
 It's like somewhere in my life a part of me died 
 And through my eyes a forgotten pain... rott in vain 
 Escapin the hell fire runnin' from flames 
 Seein moms on the kitchen floor 
 Not knowin' that the dope she injected this time was to raw 
 Saw myself trapped in the womb tryin' to get out 
 Consumed by this hell flamed pain I spit out 
 On the day we rest may our souls be free 
 I ain't mad 'cause this world made a cole like me 
 I forgive her 'cause my mother gave us all she could 
 Just another black girl lost enslaved by the hood 
 I would trade my existence to give you breath 
 Guess the only guarantes in this life is death 
 As I look around seein I'm the last one left 
 And the things I can't change I just gotta accept 
 Hook:(sang by Joya) 
 I don't want to wait for our lives to be over 
 I want to know right now what's it gonna be 
 And I don't want to wait for our lives to be over 
 I want to know right now can we all be free 
 Watchin the heat throdle on trail 'cause niggaz is tellin' 
 My rap sheet be the novel of a predicate felon 
 D.A. narrator of a story untold 
 Homicide found some evidence the truth unfold 
 Painten pictures for the jury that my heart seem cold 
 Let me explain 
 This life nearly drove me insane 
 Cell 33 I block lay in the flat 
 Eatin jack mack to far can't turn back 
 Niggaz rather see you layin on the coroners table 
 Unprepared for the war an even more disabled 
 Turn they backs on you slay you like Kane did Able 
 Heard took two in the chest an one in his navel 
 See my mom chose dope my pop chose the pipe 
 So I ryme like a triple beam balance in life 
 Hope the scale lean on my side so I can prevail 
 Most of us lay in the casket or locked in jail 
 Urban warfare guerilla combat 
 I seen a bullet tear a niggaz head off upon contact 
 So pour some Henny out for those not comin' back 
 I pour this Henny out for my nigga killa black 
 (Singing by be -Minor) 
 My days and nights are getting longer 
 We can make it on these corners 
 I can't take it anymore death is knockin' at my door 
 Will my whole life pass me by 
 I try to escape when I get high 
 I don't no if I will survive 
 Will I live or will I die 
 I don't want to wait 
 Hook:(sang by Joya) 
 I don't want to wait for our lives to be over 
 I want to know right now what's it gonna be 
 And I don't want to wait for our lives to be over 
 I want to know right now can we all be free 
 The criminal way a foul price to pay 
 Another dark day reminisin on ty yey 
 19 dead plus had baby on the way 
 Its real shit chicken heads they don't be feelin' shit 
 Pain runs deep in my life 
 It just reveals it late night 
 I'm jumpin' out the bed in cold sweat 
 Drippen wet playin' my gate wit cigerette 
 Up north six months an ain't seen my girl yet 
 She wrote me once told me she was doin' her thing 
 Wrote her back told her live her life by all means 
 Peep game 'cause things ain't as real as it seems 
 Slit her own moms throat for the taste of cream 
 Had my man dead up for the chedda time will come 
 But she bounced down south an took my son 
 If I could reach out an touch her she just get bucked 
 But I'm locked out stressed out mad as fuck 
 And I down want to wait 
 Hook:(sang by Joya) 3x 
 I don't want to wait for our lives to be over 
 I want to know right now what's it gonna be 
 And I don't want to wait for our lives to be over 
 I want to know right now can we all be free
