 'Queensbridge and we don't play' ... 
 'For every rhyme I write, it's 2-5 to life' 
 'Queensbridge and we don't play' 
 'Tragedy's the name, figured I'd just remind y'all' 
 'Queensbridge and we don't play' ... 
 'For every rhyme I write, it's 2-5 to life' 
 'Queensbridge and we don't play' 
 'My, my poetry's deep' 
 We are the Truth 
 We need no proof 
 Blowin' shots off roof 
 [Castro:] (Touch y'all, please don't make us buck y'all) 
 (Verse 1: Christ Castro) 
 Yo, the name's Castro, I'm out for pesos 
 Fuck sitting on my ass like you couch potatoes 
 While you watch wrestlin', smellin what the rock is cookin 
 I'm in the crackhouse and rock is cookin 
 Been, locked in macks, with lots of bookings 
 Beat a nigga down, fuck if them cops is lookin'! 
 Put that heater down son, 'cause if you had to pop you wouldn't 
 You would show up every shortcake topped with pudding 
 Soft ass nigga, sweet ass nigga 
 I'ma torch that nigga, peep that nigga 
 R.I.P. that nigga, ???? 
 See, I'm that nigga, my four fingers on that trigger 
 Beef me, you better pawn that vigor and buy some guns 
 'Fore they find your lungs on your doormat nigga 
 'Cause I pack price that'll flush all your organs out 
 Make yo fam cut the price in your coffin out 
 Blood drip when the force come out 
 Slugs rip through a nigga face blowin' large portion out 
 Talkin' bout, you mu'fuckers swear you live, through homicide 
 Come and talk you out 
 Now you see what you get when your ass get carried away? 
 Now your ass gettin' carried away 
 We are the Truth 
 We need no proof 
 Blowin' shots off roof 
 [Castro:] (Touch y'all, please don't make us buck y'all) 
 (Verse 2: Tragedy Khadafi) 
 Truth is truth, real is real, love is love 
 Kastro, Khadafi, Blood is Blood 
 We can go shot for shot, slug for slug 
 Hit you up, body bags zip you up 
 I am truly amazing, you cowards ain't phasing me 
 Mahdi, 2-5, the O-G 
 I cock back, and pop them thangs 
 You runnin' off octane, you don't wanna lock with the God 
 Glocks'll bang 
 Overall, feelin' my aura, feelin' my style, who you think started this thug shit? 
 But meanwhile, ask Noreag and 'pone, who kept 'em in the zone 
 41st Side, Q.B 
 Bringin' it home, homie we got that 
 Don't ever try to stop my grind, 'cause in the meantime in between tyin my nine 
 Steady long, steady strong when you fuckin' with mine 
 And I'ma ?eep? regardless to the charges I'm a G 
 Discreetly, holdin' my heat, 22's on my feet 
 Ask Havoc ask Nas, from Q.B. to South Prob y'all wanna fuck with the God 
 We are the Truth 
 We need no proof 
 Blowin' shots off roof
