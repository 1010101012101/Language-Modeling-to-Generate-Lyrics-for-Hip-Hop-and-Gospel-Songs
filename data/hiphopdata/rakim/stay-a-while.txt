Rakim... Clark Kent bring it on 
 What you wanna say to make me stay awhile 
 What you wanna say to make me wanna stay 
 (Repeat 2X) 
 Just me and my peeps we gettin' buzzed, lookin' for clubs 
 Misses with kisses and hugs, lookin' for love 
 She gotta be nice with hers, even with cookin some grub 
 Once I'm in I meet her friends, then I'm hookin my thugs 
 We'll be blowin' hundreds, always knowin' where the fun is 
 Roadrunners findin more spots than Columbus 
 Pocket full of phone numbers from some of the world wonders 
 I take my time, and find where the right one is 
 Smooth as jazz but more than a half, ready for math 
 And on a steady path, like Betty Shabazz 
 And when I see the wiz I'ma step to my biz 
 And there she is, let's see if she pass the quiz 
 It's appropriate we go get soakin wet 
 Toast, we met, become close associates 
 The place is ours by now I can embrace your style 
 So much flavor I can taste your smile, stay awhile
