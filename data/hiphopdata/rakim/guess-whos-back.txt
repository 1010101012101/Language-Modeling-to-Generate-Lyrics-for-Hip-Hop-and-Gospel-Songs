Once again back it's the incredible" 
 Yeah, yeah 
 It's the return of the Wild Style fashionist 
 Smashin hits, make it hard to adapt to this 
 Put pizazz and jazz in this, and cash in this 
 Mastered this, flash this and make 'em clap to this 
 DJ's throw on cuts and obey the crowd 
 Just pump the volume up, and play it loud 
 Hip-Hop's embedded, before I said I wouldn't let it 
 But me and the microphone is still magnetic 
 Straight off the top, I knew I'd be forced to rock 
 Dancefloors just stop, the spot's scorchin hot 
 Hoping I open Rakim Allah seminars 
 Massage at the bar smokin' ten dollar cigars 
 While I admire ?, with more vision than TV's 
 I find it easy catchin diabetes from fly sweeties 
 Sit back and wait to hear a slammin' track 
 Rockin' jams by popular demand, I'm back 
 I control the crowd, you know I hold it down 
 When it drop you know it's jiggy when you hear the sound 
 From town to town, until it's world renowned 
 And I rock New York City all year around 
 Check it out 
 It's on so you can swerve when it's heard in clubs 
 Thought patterns displayed on Persian rugs 
 Equations are drawn up in paisley form 
 Mic it stay warm, my flow is Evian 
 Deep as a Nautilus, you stay dipped in Ra style 
 From the shores of Long Island to Panama Canal 
 Intellect pitches new trends like a clothes designer 
 I'm in effect, quicker than medicines in China 
 Split the mic open fill it with somethin' potent to go in 
 And take a toke then, mental planes start floatin 
 Hot science is smokin' altitudes cause chokin 
 Product is hypnotic you're soakin and still smokin' 
 Showin better scenes than grams of amphetamines 
 Plans to scheme, means I'll forever fiend 
 Long as the mic is loud and the volume is pumpin 
 I'ma move crowds to 2000 
 Yo, my rhymes and lyrics, find spirits like a seance 
 Since fat Cray-ons, I write and display chaos 
 My plan is ?, the diagram know where the damage 
 I take advantage, until your crowd go bananas 
 What a rush I hear cuts and I lust to touch 
 Microphones get clutches by the illustrious 
 Word spread I inherited, many ways to say the unsaid 
 Born with three 7's in my head 
 In time no one can seem to blow your mind as far as this 
 To find you'll need philosophers and anthropologists 
 Astrologists, professors from your smartest colleges 
 With knowledge and scholarships, when Ra be droppin' this 
 Some of the things I know, will be in your next Bible 
 When I die go bury me and my notebook in Cairo 
 With the great God from Egypt manifest was write rhymes 
 Align with the stars, I come back to bless the mic 
 "Once again, back it's the incredible" 
 Word up, Rakim Allah the Microphone Fiend is back, ya know what I mean? 
 "Rakim Allah" 
 Till death do us part 
 "Once again, back it's the incredible" 
 It's on 
 "Rakim Allah" 
 CD sample 
 Ra sample in sequence to 3:50 
 "Once again back it's the incredible 
 The incredible, the incredible 
 The incredible... 
 Once again back it's the incredible 
 Rhyme animal, the incredible..."
