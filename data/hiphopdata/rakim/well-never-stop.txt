Yeah 
 (It don't stop) 
 Yeah 
 Check it out 
 (It don't stop) 
 Come on 
 We love to flirt 
 To chase the skirts 
 Get to know who we are 
 Girls in the park 
 'Cause when we in the club 
 We keep it extra hot 
 They love the whips the chicks 
 The neighborhood superstars 
 Boys on the block 
 Thugs in the hood we don't never stop 
 Never stop 
 I go where the masses go 
 We all act natural 
 Think rational 
 Those some blow (?) 
 Cats have to know 
 Master your craft 
 Stash your dough 
 Stay on the low 
 But never be the last to know 
 The next level or plateau be international 
 The grass'll grow 
 You know 
 Cash'll flow 
 Ask a pro 
 Do the math 
 Get it fast or slow 
 Your girl's passin gold like a fashion show 
 The sun'll shine 
 Make it feel like the summertime 
 Shorty's runnin' blind 
 Lookin' like they just done a crime 
 Click's want they pockets thick 
 Cop a 
 Proper chick 
 Street scholarships 
 Politic your dollars quick (?) 
 We 
 'Cause we was the first in the pack 
 They say "herb's a trap" 
 Now it's worse than that 
 So I observe the 
 Let my words attack 
 Until it the rap 
 Until the earth collapsed 
 You know it seem like life's just begun 
 My lust is young 
 I wanna find me a lovely hon 
 Crush me one 
 Bust a 
 Mouth to mouth resuscitation 
 Let her hug 
 And when I'm done 
 Tongue touch me till I'm numb 
 But first the outcome is income and then some 
 Get enough to run and spend some for fun 
 Then me and my thugs 
 We come in the club 
 We swung lovely 
 Watch how big the buzz be 
 Trust me son 
 Every ghetto got game in it 
 Fame in it 
 We remain in it 
 Waitin for the main event 
 Like the days on the corner 
 We watch the world go by 
 On the nights that wasn't right 
 Like when a good friend died 
 Yo the street's got a deadly hum 
 Like a drug 
 We gotta find a way to fill the neighborhood with love 
 From the park to the block 
 To your favorite spot 
 It don't stop 
 I spend the prowl (?) 
 I been on since a child 
 It don't make sense to browse 
 It's intensive now 
 Women in crowds 
 I search for the gem in the 
 Who stay original 
 Even when the friends around 
 Since her style 
 Always commands a smile 
 And her femme fatale 
 Cause men to growl 
 I take precedent of principle (?) 
 Then arouse (?) 
 Still the treasure is rakim 
 The smooth criminal 
 Damn, it's on 
 Keep my hands on 
 This amazon 
 Legs for marathons 
 Voice like sarah vaughan 
 Precise, all right 
 I like when her entice 
 With a spice of life 
 Flow times twice as nice 
 And when she go shop 
 The show stop 
 Shock the whole block 
 She so hot 
 I clothes shop 
 Put it on lock 
 Body that won't drop 
 Bounce like hip-hop 
 It don't stop
