(From the movie Wildstyle 
 If you was born in New york City let me hear say "You know that"! 
 You know that 
 Aiyyo, once upon a rhyme where the scenery sets, you see stress 
 Streets a matter of life and death, no regrets 
 Life's a test, strife, wit special effects 
 Neighbourhood's full of reps, cities are projects 
 Where the young cadets get stripes from the vets 
 And comrades quest to be the next, to finess 
 Collect debts and select bets with death threats 
 Object - Chedder, better your total net 
 Where trends are set from ways to express the outfits 
 Friends get wet tryin' to make ends connect 
 Avenues to check, boulevards to sweat 
 The smell of gunsmoke more common than cigarettes 
 WE GOT clicks for wreck 
 WE LIKE Pits for pets 
 WE GOT Giants and Jets, the Knicks, Yanks and Mets 
 WE LIKE much respect and sex extra wet 
 And High-Tech dialect you ain't catch yet 
 (The Bronx 
 Ya out there? 
 No doubt 
 Brooklyn 
 Ya out there) 
 (Rakim) 
 Aiyyo, we got blocks and glocks with 
 Big shots with big knots and big props 
 Yo this is where the bullshit stops 
 Where herbs get got 
 If you snitch you get shot 
 We get down and leave the town in a state of shock 
 WE GOT dangerous hang out spots and slick cops 
 Place called Riker's Island where kids get locked 
 A lotta gear to rock with blocks of clothes shops 
 Styles are top notch, this is the place to buy 
 So bust the box the radio station is hot 
 Ease your mind staring at skylines from rooftops 
 Flip scripts for chips 
 And new Whips of the lot 
 Quick to call a shot, pollitic with thick plots 
 And the Garden of Eden against the sea that we got 
 To make sure the core of the big apple don't rot 
 Where seeings believing we be achieving a lot 
 Since disc jocks created hip hop, check it out! 
 (Queens 
 Ya out there? 
 No doubt 
 Manhatten 
 No doubt 
 New York city 
 Staten Island 
 New york new york 
 Long Island 
 New york 
 Ya out there) 
 (Rakim) 
 Aiyo, we got five bouroughs of ghettos 
 With amny places to meet, you get lost in city streets 
 The city that never sleeps 
 Mecca ? Medina the population increase 
 The desert and the oasis, New York, the far east 
 With gods and Sheiks 
 Pretty amazons for weeks 
 Player dons that fleece the family's black sheep 
 Icons that teach that we all act unique 
 We got stats to reach so we all have to eat 
 A mass of peeps, with they own masterpiece 
 The crafts elite, we going past the beat 
 The latest technique no other place get as deep 
 Who parks release some of the worlds greatest athletes 
 DJs and MCs and graffiti artistes 
 Who use walls and subway trains for marquees 
 We go back to b-boys, breakdancing, breakbeats 
 And it'll never cease and on that note 
 We say peace
