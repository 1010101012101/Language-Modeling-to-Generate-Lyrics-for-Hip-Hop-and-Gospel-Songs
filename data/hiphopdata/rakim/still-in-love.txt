Hey yo every time hear some real hip hop man I start thinking... yo I"m still in love man ...listen 
 I'm in booth like prison 
 Lid like lift 
 If music's like woman 
 I'm whipped like a nymph 
 I love to keep it pushing 
 Like the basement speakers 
 Love hearing real hip hop and making heaters 
 Born entertainer 
 Armed with the flamer 
 If they bust shoots with it 
 Come on it's the blamer 
 Got the place to lose it 
 Booth shaking to it 
 True gangster music 
 Screwface included 
 Macho lingo 
 The beat'll remind you 
 Of the quatro cinco 
 Or cinco de mayo 
 Put it in your car 
 Turn the sound sky high 
 Ra down the block sound like a drive by 
 Keep chicks moving 
 Heat keep them open 
 Put 'em in the mood and they leave something broken 
 D.J set the scene to it in the club 
 Sound track to the hood theme music for the thug 
 I told you I'm still in love baby 
 Beats drop heavy every rhyme one ton 
 Streets not ready hurry nine one one 
 Spot gets frantic 
 Too late to panic 
 The meteor they can't stop from hitting the planet 
 Sodom and Gamorah 
 Sadam and Osama 
 The horror without the bomb and no llama 
 Spitting at a show performing 
 Vocals are swarming 
 Flow overflowing like it's global warming 
 I flood the market out 
 I'm over your head now 
 Roll the carpet out 
 The droughts over and dead now 
 When I kill a track 
 The true story the cause of euphoria 
 The thrillers back 
 Next flow level 
 Hip hop lover 
 Dress code ghetto 
 Lit vibe cutter 
 Just an artist trying to rep the hardest 
 And make history so not even death can part us 
 It's love 
 I'm still in love baby I'm still in love 
 It's the god Rakim 
 They know I get it (in) 
 They pull me back (in) 
 I'm going back (in) 
 Spitting fire 
 Ghetto music 
 Getting higher like a drug therapeutic 
 Hooked like an addict 
 Strung like sex 
 Look I got to have it 
 It alleviates stress 
 Quick as marijuana settle in the brain 
 Needle hit the record like heroin to vein 
 Blood start flowing 
 Adrenaline rush 
 Love start jonesing 
 School yard crush 
 Ra still feining still emceeing 
 More deals and geeing 
 Broads still screaming 
 It's that dude here's that sick 
 Spit that jewel 
 Talk that (shhh) 
 And wait till the lights go off the show start 
 That's when it's time for Ra to go hard 
 I told you I'm still in love 
 Always was
