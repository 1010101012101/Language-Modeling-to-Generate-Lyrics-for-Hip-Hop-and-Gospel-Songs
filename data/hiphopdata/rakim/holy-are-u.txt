Holy are you 
 Holy are you 
 There is no God but you (ah huh) 
 There is no God but you 
 (I need to talk to y'all for a minute) 
 Praised be the Lord 
 (And be serious for a minute) 
 Holy are you (here it is) 
 Holy are you 
 There is no God but you 
 There is no God but you (Rakim Allah) 
 There is no God (G-O-D, the God MC) 
 Praised be the Lord (Yeah) 
 For those who find it hard to believe, and it is 
 Why they call me the God MC, the lyricist 
 Trace this style to the roots from Genesis 
 The world wonder, of still standing like pyramids 
 Design so vivid, every brick it got a story to tell 
 My rhyme flow different like a hieroglyphic 
 Mind prolific, infinite, like mathematic 
 The first language, now add that, and add graphics (Go 'head) 
 Then go let the blocks know it's the gospel 
 Lifes new manual, so watch close 
 The new Michaelangelo or Pablo Picasso 
 Prepared to show you the cosmos and rhyme flows 
 Even my lyrical metaphysical 
 What this will do is help you get to your spiritual pinnacle 
 You find your mind too far-fetched for it to fathom 
 I bring the darkness to the light, split the atom 
 It's like watching the big bang theory emerge 
 I take titles, bond them to reveal new words 
 They want a clear view 
 From the farthest and the darkest corners in the universe 
 To a corner near you 
 A pharaoh in ghetto apparel, stay blinged up 
 Fort Knox display, a modern day King Tut 
 Wrapped tight, rap like I've been preserved in time 
 Spit the holy water, then touch it and turn it to wine 
 It's the God 
 Holy are you 
 Holy are you 
 There is no God but you (I, I am the Alpha and Omega) 
 There is no God but you (you are not what you heard) 
 Praised be the Lord (you don't even know what you once were) 
 We were children of the most high, so we fell 
 From paradise to holy hell 
 Probably descendants of the Holy Grail 
 Another part of history they won't reveal 
 Times'll only tell 
 You waiting for Judgment? It came 
 In the form of a thug in the game 
 To create a strong position, there's blood in my vein 
 The chemical is identical, we one and the same 
 With seven letters in all three of my government names 
 Walk on water? Nah, neither did Jesus 
 It's a parable to make followers and readers believers 
 From Egypt to Budapest, Rakim is the truest left 
 Understand the Scriptures like the minister Louis F 
 I told you who God is, you ignored me like most the prophets 
 Jesus, Solomon, Abraham, Moses and Muhammad 
 I showed the scholars, we'll fulfill the broken promise 
 I spit this truth to predict the future like Nostradamus 
 Like Revelations, I'm hoping my quotes reveal 
 The seven spirits of God when I open the seal 
 Interpret the holy Quran, these flows will guide you 
 Translate the Torah, and decode the Bible 
 Warn the elders in the mosques, masons, and the law 
 The seven churches, the synagogues, it's the Renaissance 
 Skin is bronze, like the Messiah 
 Rakim Allah's 'bout to reveal a bigger secret than time and the God 
 Holy are you 
 Holy are you 
 There is no God but you (I want to challenge you) 
 There is no God but you (and soon I will challenge the talents of the Lord) 
 Praised be the Lord (I, I am the Alpha and Omega) 
 Rakim Allah 
 Peace
