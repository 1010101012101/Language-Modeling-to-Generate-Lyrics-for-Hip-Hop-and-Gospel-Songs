What, uh, yo 
 Just when things seemed the same, and the whole scene is lame 
 I come and reign with the unexplained for the brains till things change 
 They strain to slang sling, I'm trained to bring game 
 History that I arranged been regained by King James 
 Go to practice, with tactics, when the track hits, theatrics 
 Women that look like actress the status of Cleopatra's 
 Stacks of mathematics took the ?ego-a-geatics? 
 As I find out, what the facts is, for geographic 
 No time to sip Mo's with hostess, never mind what the total gross is 
 I rip shows, stay focused, and split cheese, with soldiers 
 While you hit trees and coast I spit flows that be ferocious 
 And with these explosives, I split seas for Moses 
 Shine permanently only my mind's concernin me 
 Fire burns in me eternally time's eternity 
 Followers turn on me they'll be in a mental infirmary 
 Determinely advance technology better than Germany 
 Since the first days you know of, till the last days is over 
 I was always the flow-er, I made waves for Noah 
 From a compound, to the anatomy, to the breakdown of a atom 
 Some of my rap patterns, still surround Saturn 
 From the ancient Hieroglyphics, to graffiti painted pictures 
 I study I know the scriptures but nowaday ain't it vicious 
 Date back I go beyond check the holy Qu'ran 
 To speeches at the altar on, now we get our party on 
 So being benificent, I bless 'em with dialogue 
 They expectin, the next testament by the God 
 I blow 'em through battlezones with chrome for chaperone 
 Blast beats with saxophones one of the baddest rapper's known 
 Every country city and borough, sidestreet and ghetto 
 Isle and alley and meadow theories ferile enough to echo 
 When it was one mass of land, with one nash' of man 
 And the whole mass was ran under one master plan 
 Since the world's metamorphis, and the plan is kept in orbit 
 Turntables we spin off but the needles never skip off it 
 Rhythms we expressin similar to our ancestors 
 It'll answer your questions if you understand the message 
 From the days of the slave choppers?, to the new age of prophets 
 As heavy as hip-hop is I'm always ready to drop it 
 From the mind which is one of Allah's best designs 
 And mines'll stand the test of time, when I rhyme 
 The 18th Letter, the prophesy professor 
 I stay clever, long as the planet stay together 
 Bring up praise from Mecca, make a phrase for the better 
 In new days to remember, always and forever 
 (Repeat 2X) 
 The R baby
