Planet Earth was my place of birth 
 Born to be the sole controller of the universe 
 Besides the part of the map I hit first 
 Any environment I can adapt when it gets worse 
 The rough gets goin' the goin' gets rough 
 When I start flowin the mic might bust 
 The next state'll shake from the power I generate 
 People in Cali used to think it was earthquakes 
 Cause times is hard on the boulevard 
 So I bogaurd and never get scared I'm god 
 But it seems like I'm locked in hell 
 Lookin' over the edge but the R never fell 
 Or tripped or slipped cause my Nikes got grip 
 I stand on my own two feet and come equipped 
 Any stage I'm seen on the mic I feind on 
 I stand alone and need nothin' to lean on 
 Goin' for self with a long way to go 
 So much to say but I still flow slow 
 I come correct and I won't look back 
 Cause it ain't where you from it's where you at 
 Even the "Ghetto" 
 I learn to relax in my room and escape from New York 
 And Return through the womb of the world as a thought 
 Thinkin' how hard it was to be born 
 Me being cream with no physical form 
 Millions of cells with one destination 
 To reach the best part that's life's creation 
 Nine months later a job well done 
 Make way cause here I come 
 Since I made it this far can't stop now 
 There's a will and a way and I got the know-how 
 To be all there is to be and more 
 To see all there is to see before 
 I'm called to go back to the essence 
 It's a lot to learn so I studied my lessons 
 I thought the ghetto was the worst that could happen to me 
 I'm glad I listened when my father was rapping to me 
 Cause back in the days they lived in caves 
 Exiled from the original man and strayed away 
 Now that's what I call hard times 
 I'd rather be here to exercise the mind 
 Then I take a thought around the world twice 
 From knowledge the form back to knowledge precise 
 Across the desert that's hot as the Arabian 
 But they couldn't cave me in 'cause I'm the Asian 
 Reaching for the city of Mecca visit Medina 
 Visions of Nefertiti then I seen her 
 Mind keeps travelin I'll be back after I 
 Stop and think about the brothers and sisters in Africa 
 Return the thought through the eye of a needle 
 For miles I fought and I just fought the people 
 Under the darks skies on a dark side 
 Not only there but right here's an aparthied 
 So now is the time for us to react 
 Take a trip through the mind and when you get back 
 Understand your third eye seen all of that 
 It ain't where you from it's where you at 
 Even the "Ghetto" 
 No more props I want property in every Burrough 
 Nobody's stoppin' me because I'm thorough 
 Rhymes I make give me real estate for me to own 
 Where ever I bless a microphone 
 Double O seven is back and relaxin 
 On point and reactin and ready for action 
 I'm so low key that you might not see me 
 Incognito and takin' it easy 
 Quiet is kept on a hush hush 
 In front of a crowd I get loud as a bum rush 
 But calm keep a low pro and play the background 
 Hoping the wack rappers put the mic back down 
 So rip it break it in half go ahead and slam it 
 'Cause when it's time to build I'm a mechanic 
 I'm bondin and mendin attachin and blendin 
 So many solos there is no ending 
 People in my neighborhood they know I'm good 
 From London to Hollywood where ever I stood 
 Footprints remain on stage ever since 
 Sidewalks and streets I leave fossils and dents 
 When I had sex I left my name on necks 
 My Trademark was left throughout the projects 
 I used to get rich when I played c-lo 
 When I rolled 4,5,6 they go we know 
 So I collect my cash then slide 
 I got my back my gun's on my side 
 It shouldn't have to be like that 
 I guess it ain't where you from it's where you at 
 Even the "Ghetto"
