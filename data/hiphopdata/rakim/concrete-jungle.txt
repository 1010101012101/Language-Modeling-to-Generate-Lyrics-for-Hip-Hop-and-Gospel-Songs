Bob Marley: Even the spiritual environment, 
 Igher divinity, Rastaman 
 Dilution which is like earth create, 
 Because the earth come back from what it wants, 
 Someone is trying to be as powerful as god. 
 *Scratches* 
 Here's a little story that must be told. (2x) 
 Come On (2X) 
 Concrete Jungle 
 Here's a little story that must be told. (2x) 
 Come On (2X) 
 No son will shine in my day today, 
 The high yellow moon won't come out to play, 
 Darkness has covered my light, (ooh) 
 And has changed my day to night yeah, (ooh) 
 Where is this love to be found (Where's this love to be found) 
 I would say that life must be somewhere to be found (Sweet life) 
 Instead of Concrete Jungle, (Jungle, oh, oh oh,) 
 Concrete Jungle, (Jungle) 
 Man you have to do your thing yeah. (Jungle) 
 Oh yeah. 
 Scratches: 
 Come On 
 No chains around my feet but I'm not free, here now 
 I know I am bound here in captivity 
 Ooh. 
 Never know 
 Never known happiness 
 Never known 
 Never known what real 
 Well I'm always laughing like a clown (oh) 
 I said I've, I've got to be passing from off the ground yeah (oh, instead of) 
 Concrete Jungle (Jungle) 
 Illusions, Illusions (Concrete Jungle) 
 Concrete Jungle (Concrete Jungle) 
 Oh, no no no 
 Concrete Jungle 
 Rakim: 
 Yeah, Yeah, Yeah (come on) 
 In the lions den, 
 You hear the cry of the dying men, 
 The lions in, 
 Every puddle about it then 
 You try and win go against the blind to win 
 It'll put the eye of the tiger in iron men 
 The heart beats like animals in dark street, 
 Starve to eat, 
 In the jungle it's concrete, 
 Instead of wood we use the metal to draw heat, 
 The habitats the hood, 
 They single the god beats 
 The tribals in a deadly game of survival, 
 Genicidial, 
 Read you Koran and your Bible, 
 When the merciful get merciless 
 We need to read Psalms 82 verse 6 
 Its real so make you sure you do real thing, 
 Females never forget your still queens, 
 Feel it till you feel free with wings, 
 And the male we ain't got to kill to be kings 
 Concrete Jungle (Jungle) (Come on now) 
 Concrete Jungle (Come on) (3x)
