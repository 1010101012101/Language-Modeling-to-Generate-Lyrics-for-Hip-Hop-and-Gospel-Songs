Yeah son 
 I'm the true son 
 What you wanna do son 
 Yo this a story about me and my first love nah mean? 
 Yeah son hit it off 
 We hooked up at a party it been then ever since 
 When I first stepped to her I was nervous and tense 
 Didn't know was bout to kick, I went freestyle 
 Straight off the top, with suckas on the side just clocked 
 She musta liked my flow, 'cause after that we got close 
 Spending long weekends freakin' up and down the east coast 
 We got intimate, deep as the pacific 
 The chemistry was meant to be so then we ran without the ministry 
 Up in this industry tryin' to get this platinum 
 Many rappers tried to tap her, it wasn't happenin' 
 I watched her from afar, starin' at her like a fan 
 And now I got her in the palm of my right hand 
 Forever, as long as we can stick together 
 I guarantee you we blow up, 'cause with 'em I'm a trend setter 
 We signed a contract said yo, it's me and you 
 Meet you at the top of the charts, where the skys blue 
 Yo yo yo God bless a child that can hold his own 
 Its just me, myself and my microphone 
 Yo you gotta stick with it dun you can't leave it alone 
 Its just me, myself and my microphone 
 No matter where you plug it on the road or at home yo 
 Its just me, myself and my microphone 
 Yo God bless a child that can hold his own 
 My girl can't understand all this time we spend together 
 I tried to tell her 
 Its strictly business, she said she had a witness 
 Who saw us comin' out the hotel 
 Nosy people always gotta run and go tell 
 But it was just a tour date I had to do a show 
 So next time tell your friend to talk what she know 
 I wouldn't trade this shit for the world 
 In fact you better check yourself, 'cause I can always find another girl 
 The microphone is my first love my true companion 
 When I rap into it people think that I'm romancin' 
 I'm havin' visions, I'm foldin' it tight 
 Just me and you a phat track'll lead the spotlight 
 Right 
 We been through the ruckus together 
 Handle that beef 
 MCs got damaged in cyphers on they own streets 
 So ladi dadi, forget a shotty 
 I put a hole in your body with my lyrics when I rock it uh 
 I hit her in the back of a club and no one showed her love 
 In fact it was a seminar you know how some women are 
 Takin' up my time, I tried to stay committed 
 Kedar and the Smith brothers made me stick with it 
 Now we politicin', on a mission tryin' to make decisions 
 To keep her on the cut and work just like a circumcision 
 Static in our relationship, it's all distorted 
 The lines of communication, they got shorted 
 I can't ignore it, you know I couldn't afford it 
 To have this world tour planned for us abort it 
 Now I'm on some shit, rollin' with my clique 
 The mic is my companion that's all and that's it baby 
 Like that one time for your mind 
 For real son, keep it real son 
 Me and my microphone stayin' together forever 
 A+ and Q-Tip like this 
 Smith brothers in the spot you know what I'm sayin'
