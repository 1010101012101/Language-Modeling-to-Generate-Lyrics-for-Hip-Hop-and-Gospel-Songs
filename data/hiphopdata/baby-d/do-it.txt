 Wiggle ya big brown ass like a jaw breaker 
 See like Buffy you were lucky to have a back like that 
 See like my razor phone ma stomach flat like that 
 A lil cute six-pack 
 Around her navel is a tat 
 A lotta hatas in da back 
 'Cause stilettoes got her stacked up 
 Watch her do a dance and ya see how they back up 
 And if you don't know how then watch her Act Up 
 Pull up on ya like namel doors on a lac truck 
 Break it down turn around for a couple stacks what 
 Ay come on shawty lemme see ya thong

 Do It [x13] 
 And if you don't know how then watch her do it 
 Do It [x13] 
 And if you don't know how then watch her do it 
 A bounce stop then lean 
 Now snap ya fingers 
 A bounce stop then lean

 A bounce stop then lean 
 If you don't know how then watch her do it 
 Now snap ya fingers
