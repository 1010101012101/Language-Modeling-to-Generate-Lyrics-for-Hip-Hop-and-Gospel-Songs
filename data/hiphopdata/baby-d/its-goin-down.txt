 Put it down for all my niggas reppin' that funky A-Town 
 It don't matter where you from shawty do what you do 
 Rep your city let me see ya throw it up 'cause I'm a rep mine too 
 LA to Tennesse all the way to the NYC 
 I'm talking 'bout the side but I know its Double O to P 
 Known for getting the club pumped up and outta control 
 And making them girls come up up outta they clothes 
 24's I found some dro and we do the damn thing 
 Sip Champagne in the VIP is just a part of the game 
 But who's to blame when the clubs getting buck ass wild 
 It's them boys from the A throwing bows in the crowd 
 Keep talking loud and watch it man, I'll shut you up 
 'Cause I'm the butta-sudder but your bound to get stuck 
 You better duck, or get your ass stomped to the ground 
 If you don't know by now it's about to go down 
 (Dru) 
 I can't believe it we keep on ryhmin 
 Don't make me go out in silence 
 Talking when we just resort to violence 
 Talkin' just can't just stop those problems 
 Back in the club 
 We pushin those bottles 
 Have to be drinkin' 
 What is y'all thinking? 
 What? 
 It ain't goin' down 
 Bitch we blowin' up the nation 
 Paper chasin 
 Leavin' them trails blazin' 
 Only hell can save em 
 God can raise em 
 Had to take em 
 Don't throw parky evermo 
 Holiday rapin 
 D-R-U is scared of payton 
 Whatcha say? 
 Absoultly nothing partner 
 Pullin' them down I'm captivatin' 
 Living this life it has to go down 
 Ridin' around to push and the pound 
 Any mo? 
 Smokin' the dro 
 Wallet with money is shakin' with dough 
 Kickin them dough 
 Just makin' sho 
 I am getting down to get loot 
 Except my struggles 
 Halleiugh 
 Messin with family I will do ya 
 I ain't got no reason to lie 
 Now its head of the season when I see you we ride 
 We ain't gonna even reply 
 Shawty, we lettin' 'em fly 
 We throwin' 'em up 
 And lettin' 'em know it's goin' down tonight 
 (Bonecrusher)

 Nigga yeah I ain't never scared

 When I give the command 
 Leave his body in his shoes 
 Where the fuck nigga stands 
 Run through y'all 
 From the ???? to the Squad

 Horse manure y'all 
 Yo it's personal to me 
 Like a mother fuckers want it

 Headin to swats
