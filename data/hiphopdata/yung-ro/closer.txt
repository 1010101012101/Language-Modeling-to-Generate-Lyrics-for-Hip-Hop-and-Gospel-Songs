I wanna be closer, to you 
 What's up homie you know me, one of many with smile faces 
 Still complaining about this life, full of pain with a small plate 
 But I understand your plan, you the woman 
 And now that I'm hurt, I desperately need to hold your hand 
 Cause over the years this pain, has made our relationship much stronger 
 I'm patient and much stronger, but still facing this bad karma 
 For real it's too real, you see these vibes I'm getting 
 Mistreated by my own blood, you hear these lies I'm getting 
 But these guys forgive em, me too 'cause I am sinning 
 Trying to find peace in places, the devil disguised and hidden 
 I'm drowning in my own sin, realizing my pain 
 Losing faith losing love, all flushed down the drain 
 What can I do to maintain, I tried my friends and family 
 Find myself alone in tears, dear God how can it be 
 Or can it bell all for a reason, because I just need you 
 Well if so then so it be, and let them see the message too 
 (Talking) 
 Close, close I gotta get close 
 You gotta keep a piece of mind, I know I do 
 I ain't perfect 
 Dear God I'm scarred, I'm trying it's hard 
 Your right it's easy, I'm close it's far 
 It's dark I'm cold, I'm wrong I know 
 I'm trying I'm dying, I'm crying my soul 
 I'm searching for forgivness, I'm trying to do better 
 I can't sleep it's six o'clock, and I'm writing you this letter 
 Show my people I love em, because they breaking my heart 
 Show me a sign, should we work it out or just stay apart 
 I just wanna play apart, in your righteous path 
 I can't drive this car alone, because I might just crash 
 They say I take things too serious, I'm taking that serious 
 And God to be serious, I think I'm too serious 
 But you made me who I am, and Da Assassin proud 
 I don't know I don't know, what's beyond them clouds 
 But I do know love, and I thought I thought that through you 
 But sometimes I give out, and I don't know what to do 
 (Talking) 
 I was just thinking, relationships 
 No desire, how close you is to that person 
 Now I messed up anyway 
 Dear God my baby's hurting, I don't know what to do 
 So I sent a prayer out to her, guide her ship and help her through 
 Help us makeit through this pain, I wanna learn this lesson 
 I felt the love was so real, but it just wasn't destined 
 A lot of questions lot of mistakes, and ended up where we at 
 But that's that, and truthfully I wish I could take it back 
 Do something different try harder, anything but that 
 But that plus that, made me realize that 
 And when I saw it face to face, I had to swallow that fact 
 I learned alot from that what's that, That's nobody's bidness 
 Just know I'm truthfully sorry, and ask for your forgiveness 
 And God as my witness, I'm a very troubled man 
 Thought I was right I wasn't, thought I did didn't understand 
 But one thing I do know, if it was meant to be 
 We'll get closer than maybe not, who knows we'll see 
 (Talking) 
 Yeah close, I ain't gave up 
 I ain't gon worry myself though 
 Lastly, Girl I'm a get close bet that 
 You are now with the world's greatest
