Can I believe I got it all alone? 
 Can I believe the time ain't really so 
 No how I feel but don't know what to say 
 Turn the subject and let it play 
 Already played a few 'bout nothing 
 Then wanted it by fucking 
 And then I couple I made 
 Girl I didn't say it was you all alone while you were on your phone on your way 
 Already getting play 
 Girl you don't have to say a shit 
 Girl you know how my play is 
 Girl is it the sex playlist? 
 Girl you, girl you know, 
 Will I lead my head on your wipes, I'm never tired 
 Don't get me started by the way that you keep me higher 
 And I'm serious girl you know you don't have to play 
 Matter fact got the pay 
 Girl you don't have to say shit 
 Girl you know how I play this 
 Girl is it the sex playlist? 
 Girl you, girl you know, 
 Girl you, girl you know, 
 Girl you, girl you know, 
 Girl you, girl you know
