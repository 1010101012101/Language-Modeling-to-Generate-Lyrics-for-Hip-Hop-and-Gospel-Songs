All these girls in the club 
 Far away I notice her 
 She's lookin' hella' good 
 Approach her, I think I should 
 I sense some rose over there 
 Somehow she's over here 
 Gotta whisper in her ear 
 Let's leave 
 Infatuation has got me nice and clear 
 No information about her, I don't care 
 Maybe I do, but I just want what I get 
 I'm just a man, might not get another chance 
 Seem like we forgot about love 
 Seem like we forgot about love 
 Spend so much time in the club 
 Seem like we forgot about love 
 Seem like we forgot about love 
 Seem like we forgot about love 
 Spend so much time in the club 
 Seem like we forgot about love
