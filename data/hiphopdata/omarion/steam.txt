I remember my heart was feeling cold and 
 Dark clouds were rolling in 
 Told me to pull over 
 The you told me to get over it yea 
 Don't need the phone light 
 Girl it's too thick to see through 
 Stopping at the wrong light 
 Girl ain't no need to speed through 
 Nah they can't see ya 
 But even if they could 
 Still couldn't see us 
 Your love is like the sun 
 Girl you know I need ya 
 Way too thick to let go 
 Hands off my heater 
 But you could put it back on my neck though 
 I love your steam 
 Rising off your body like a dream 
 High with no smoke 
 Even if they come close 
 They'd never know 
 Cold feels so lonely 
 But it brings you close to me 
 Baby I can keep you warm 
 But if you don't take off your clothes 
 We'll never know 
 I like the way you ride 
 You like the way that I drive it 
 They compliment my ride 
 Don't know what's going on inside it 
 You said my love's a crime 
 That's why you feel so excited 
 Girl you cannot deny it 
 You're feeling closed in 
 Well you should let me inside it 
 I got your open and undivided 
 Attention on me now 
 It's cold in here 
 Call me sensitive 
 That's what I can give
