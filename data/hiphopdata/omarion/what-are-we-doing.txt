(Talking:) 
 You know sometimes you get in situations 
 And when you make that move 
 You gotta be committed 
 She know what I mean 
 We were better off friends 
 But the magic of the night had us holdin' each otha tight 
 We should've kept it right there 
 But the movie got boring and you wore those jeans I like 
 I glanced at your pretty feet 
 Your sexy hands rubbin on my chest, should I kiss u 
 I heard a voice say yes 
 Next 
 We were undressin not realizein we shouldn't be doin' this 
 What are we doin' 
 What have we done 
 What have we ruined 
 How did this happen 
 Were we just blacked out 
 What are we doin' 
 What are we doin' 
 What have we done 
 Baby I'm trippin' 
 Cause after we cut all the feeling was gone 
 Girl what did we do 
 They say some things are better off as just a fantasy 
 What came over me 
 I did not lose control 
 It must've been those jeans 
 It was the way she fit in those jeans 
 I can't even remember if it was good or not 
 All I know is that our temperature was boiling hot 
 Can't believe I just made love to my dear friend 
 I pray that this isn't damaging in the end 
 Lack of communication, got us both in the situation 
 Now there's no way out, no way out 
 'Cause we can't turn back time, no 
 We're staring at the ceiling with the cover tuck pulled up to our necks 
 Like o 
 Should've never let you come here alone no no 
 I know I just enjoy seeing you naked 
 Now I can't look, now I can't look 
 We did this, it's a price we have to pay 
 Now there's nothin' to say 
 (Verse 3: rap) 
 She was a friend of mine 
 Fine, slim waistline 
 I never thought she'd be feelin' me, never seen the sign 
 My homie said I'll eventually hit it a while back 
 I told him naw, she fam, it ain't like that 
 I found myself starin' at that azz a couple times 
 Threw without a sight in mind 
 Been knowin' her since I was nine 
 But a moment alone in a soft bed changed everything 
 Never thought that we would come to this extreme
