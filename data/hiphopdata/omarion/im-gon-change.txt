(Omarion verse 1) 
 I'm gon change 
 I'm gon change 
 I'm gon change 
 I'm gon change 
 You said you sick and tired of me 
 That I gotta leave 
 I wasn't doin' mah part 
 I tried to dig deep inside of me 
 Hoping that I can see 
 How I was breaking your heart 
 Now mah friends think I'm trippin' 
 They think I'm slippin 
 But they just don't understand 
 That when I'm with chu it feels right 
 You make me feel like 
 Like I'm a man 
 I'll do 
 Anything you want me to 
 O whoa whoa whoa 
 Girl I'm here to show and prove 
 O whoa whoa I 
 I never wanna leave you, Girl I wanna please you 
 I just wanna see you right here next to me 
 Baby (I'm gon change) 
 Tell me what to do 
 I wanna be with chu 
 I know I messed it up before 
 But I'm gon change 
 Oh baby 
 I was so untrue 
 I'll make it up to you 
 I know I messed it up before 
 But baby I'm gon change 
 (Omarion verse 2) 
 Now girl you took a part of me 
 And it ain't hard to see 
 To see I'm losing mah head 
 I'm all alone with thoughts inside of me 
 Can't get them out of me 
 I'm missin' you in mah bed 
 I know your friends say to leave me 
 Made it seem easy 
 But baby you don't understand (No, O) 
 That when you're with me it feels right 
 I'll make you feel like no other man can 
 I'll do 
 Anything you want me to 
 O whoa whoa whoa 
 Girl I'm here to show and prove 
 O whoa whoa I 
 I never wanna leave you, Girl I wanna please you 
 I just wanna see you right here next to me 
 Baby (Yeah, I'm gon change) 
 Tell me what to do (Tell me what to do) 
 I wanna be with chu (Ooh I, O) 
 I know I messed it up before (Before but I'm gon change) 
 But I'm gon change 
 Oh baby (O, O, O) 
 I was so untrue (So untrue I) 
 I'll make it up to you (Make it up to you, I) 
 I know I messed it up before (I know I messed it up before) 
 But baby I'm gon change 
 Just let me explain 
 That I'll never do it again 
 If I could I'd take all the pain 
 Because I know I hurt you 
 Girl dogone all those lies 
 And for all those times I made you cry 
 Baby I apologize 
 Because you everything to me 
 I'll do 
 Anything you want me to 
 O whoa whoa whoa 
 Girl I'm here to show and prove 
 O whoa whoa I 
 I never wanna leave you, Girl I wanna please you 
 I just wanna see you right here next to me

 But baby I'm gon change
