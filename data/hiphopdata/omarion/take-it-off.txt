I love how you doin' the things you do 
 Ghetto girl with the braids and the Nike shoes 
 I don't mean no disrespect to you 
 But a nigga really tryin' to fuck wit you 
 See you looking at me with those hazel eyes 
 Big chest, Big {ass} and those big ol thighs 
 All eyes on you and that's 4sho 
 You shakin' it like you in my video. 
 Mami shake it 
 Mami work it 
 Girl I lovin' the way you work it 
 So Mami can you take it off 
 That's all I really wanna do is see you take it off (Take it off, Take it off girl) 
 Your body is bangin' ... Girl 
 Don't leave me hangin' 
 So Mami can you take it off 
 That's all I really wanna do is see you take it off (Take it off, Take it off girl) 
 Swinging your hips from left to right 
 I'm tryin' to leave this place with you tonight 
 Really wanna see you take it off for me 
 Love what you doin' when you doin' that shit for me 
 It be shakin' like a Polaroid picture 
 I'm just tryin' to get behind and grindin' wit' cha 
 Up and down, round and round, side to side we go 
 Damn girl I gotta put you in my video. 
 Mami shake it 
 Mami work it 
 Girl I lovin' the way you work it 
 So Mami can you take it off 
 That's all I really wanna do is see you take it off (Take it off, Take it off girl) 
 Your body is bangin' ... Girl 
 Don't leave me hangin' 
 So Mami can you take it off 
 That's all I really wanna do is see you take it off (Take it off, Take it off girl) 
 Niggas wanna cut, cut 
 'Cause I love the way ya bitch move that butt, butt 
 Haterz throw ya hands up 
 Chickens do the cluck cluck 
 Jimmy Cohoes got me walkin' with a mean strut 
 Sexy but I'm so rough 
 Now we bout to set it off 
 Long island, Ice Tea, or a Smirnoff 
 This is a jump off 
 And we bout to take it off 
 T.U.G. we in this bitch we tear the roof off 
 4,5 let it off 
 Now we drinkin' we gettin' our party on 
 The new tag team Mila J and Omarion 
 You ain't a balla wit spinnas on ya neon 
 Wish you'd disappear like poof begone 
 My team holds like 5 or 6 hoes 
 Haterz try-n copy our style like Kinko's 
 Niggas lean back, Bitches dip low 
 If you can't do that, throw ya hands up lets go. 
 Mami shake it 
 Mami work it 
 Girl I lovin' the way you work it 
 So Mami can you take it off 
 That's all I really wanna do is see you take it off (Take it off, Take it off girl) 
 Your body is bangin' ... Girl 
 Don't leave me hangin' 
 So Mami can you take it off 
 That's all I really wanna do is see you take it off (Take it off, Take it off girl)
