 Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl 
 Lets Go! 
 I don't need nobody else around see 
 Love the way you compliment my style 
 Though you may end up bein' my only gurl 
 'Cause when ur with me ur my whole world 
 Like when it's just me and you 
 Vibe is crazy between us two 
 Ur my homie my lover indeed and my friend 
 Now I said this before I'm a say it again 
 Now here is the situtaion 
 I like what we've got happening 
 And I don't want nothing comin' in betweenn both me and you 
 I'll let you bee lieutenant if you let me be captain 
 Tell me if that's cool 
 Baby I want you to be my entourage 
 (Super fly chick) 
 You could be my personal superstar 
 (Super fly chick) 
 Baby I want you to be my entourage

 If you want then we could take this very far 
 (Super fly chick) 
 You're a star in ur own right 
 At times you steal the whole spotlight 
 I don't mind gurl your find put a Smile on my face 
 Besides who want a chick that no dude would chase 
 Sometimes I know your unsure 
 Wonder if this will endure 
 Don't make me make a promise that I can't keep 
 Cause its cool how it is lets not complicate things Gurl
