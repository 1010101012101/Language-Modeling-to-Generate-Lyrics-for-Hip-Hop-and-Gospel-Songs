I know it's been a long time but 
 This here right here is the Omarion mix 
 Let's go 
 Can I heat it while it's storming, storming 
 While the weather's transforming, transforming 
 Can I heat it in the morning, morning 
 Can I heat it in the morning, morning 
 While the weather's transforming, transforming 
 Can I heat it while it's storming, storming 
 Baby this your morning 
 Go ahead and own it 
 Be the landlord 
 Property owner 
 All exclamations 
 It's how it happened 
 My Aston Martin 
 The sex was trapped in 
 I didn't get a chance to take her to dinner 
 I saw the front ? she's no beginner 
 Even in her 2 seater I had to pin her 
 Then got on the fly 
 Do you remember 
 'Cause I do I do 
 Will there be a round 2 
 Question mark 
 Damn I should have missed my flight my flight 
 He would only be right on right in 
 To cook you breakfast bacon eggs and toast 
 Don't forget the ring 
 Can I heat it while it's storming, storming 
 While the weather's transforming-forming 
 Can I heat it in the morning, morning 
 Can I? 
 Can I heat it in the morning, morning 
 While the weather's transforming-forming 
 Can I heat it while it's storming, storming 
 God bless the women that can hold patron 
 God bless her home girl that drove us home 
 No strings attached like a cordless phone 
 You see my intentions with you was clear 
 I'm learning not to judge a woman by the shit that she wear 
 Therefore you shouldn't judge a nigga off the shit that you hear 
 Get all defensive apprehensive all because my career 
 To be fair I know we barely know each other 
 And yeah somehow I wound up in your bed 
 So where we headed from here 
 To say you're scared if you're scared but if you're through frontin? we can do somethin'? 
 And you know just what I'm talkin' about 
 Tomorrow you'll be calling out 
 Cause tonight we getting right into the? 
 Cook a nigga breakfast after sex is like a reward 
 Then I go my own way you think about me all day 
 That's just a warm neck 
 Can I hit in the morning (x3) 
 The sun rising while you're mourning 
 Can I hit in the morning (x3) 
 The sun rising while you're mourning 
 Yeah
