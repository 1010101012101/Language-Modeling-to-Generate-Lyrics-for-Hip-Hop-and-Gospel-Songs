She got away from me. 
 I don't even know where she's been. 
 She's been constantly on my mind. 
 Doesn't matter who she's been with. 
 But... I gotta get her back. 
 And I'm a do whatever it takes. 
 How could she walk away? 
 She's supposed to be mine. 
 All mine. 
 I gotta get her (get her) 
 I gotta get her (ger her) 
 I gotta get her because she's not goin'. 
 I gotta get her (get her) 
 She my number one spot 
 (So forget about her) 
 On my billboard charts 
 (Forget about her) 
 Oh you think you hot? 
 (Forget about her) 
 Man, gone' head' stop 
 (Forget about her) 
 (Ho!) (forget about her) [x8] 
 I wonder... 
 "Have I been on her brain? " 
 "How will it be when we meet face to face? " 
 The penetrating stare. 
 She thinks it matters who she's been with. 
 But... do you remember the time? 
 12/26/06 (says:"twelve, twenty-six, o six") 
 How could I forget that day? 
 Ooh! no! 
 I gotta get her (get her) 
 I gotta get her (ger her) 
 I gotta get her because she's not goin'. 
 I gotta get her (get her) 
 She my number one spot 
 (So forget about her) 
 On my billboard charts 
 (Forget about her) 
 Oh you think you hot? 
 (Forget about her) 
 Man, gone' head' stop 
 (Forget about her) 
 (Ho!) (forget about her) [x8] 
 I gotta get her (get her) 
 I gotta get her (ger her) 
 I gotta get her because she's not goin'. 
 I gotta get her (get her) 
 She my number one spot 
 (So forget about her) 
 On my billboard charts 
 (Forget about her) 
 Oh you think you hot? 
 (Forget about her) 
 Man, gone' head' stop 
 (Forget about her) 
 (Ho!) (forget about her) [x8]
