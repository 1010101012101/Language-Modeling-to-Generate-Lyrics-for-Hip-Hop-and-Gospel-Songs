Omarion: 
 Come and get me (she said) 
 Are you ready (she said) 
 For this lovin' (she said 
 I jus departed, car started 
 She's flexible, I know she wanna 
 Kill me, Kill me, Play me, Play me, of her love 
 I'm pulling over 
 Marques: 
 What's this car parked outside 
 Who the hell is this nigga, jus hoped out his ride? 
 I jus wanna, I jus wanna know 
 'Cause if its bad business girl you gotta let me know 
 'Cause I every time I sleep, I dream about cha 
 And every time I think, I think about ya 
 I don't wanna be in this without cha 
 Just wouldn't be me, if not without cha, 
 So let me know girl if your cheatin' on me 
 You gotta let me know who the hell is on me 
 I jus wanna know if you know me... ah fuck it ill jus go outside
