Oh (Shorty, Imma grind, I can grind, now com'on) 
 Oh (Shorty, Imma grind, I can grind, now com'on) 
 Oh (Shorty, Imma grind, I can grind, now com'on) 
 Oh (Shorty, Imma grind, I can grind, now com'on) 
 She worth every hour that I put in 
 If I had to do it over, I'd do it again 
 She's the girl that every captain wants to save 
 And I can't let her get away 
 Imma hustle harder 
 Hard enough to keep her 
 Player don't even bother 
 I'll never leave her 
 I'm on my grind (grind, grind, grind) 
 All day, all night 
 I'm on my grind (grind, grind, grind) 
 Like I ain't made a dime 
 I'm on my grind (grind, grind, grind) 
 Like a 9 to 5 with no pay 
 I'll do it all, whatever it takes 
 On the real, I'm about mine 
 I'm on my grind 
 Like a feen for her, I can't wait 
 I'm like an alcoholic, I need a taste 
 I'm on the block just so I can keep you fly 
 They say I'm trickin but I don't mind 
 Imma hustle harder 
 Hard enough to keep her 
 Player don't even bother 
 I'll never leave her 
 I'm on my grind (grind, grind, grind) 
 All day, all night 
 I'm on my grind (grind, grind, grind) 
 Like I ain't made a dime 
 I'm on my grind (grind, grind, grind) 
 Like a 9 to 5 with no pay 
 I'll do it all, whatever it takes 
 On the real, I'm about mine 
 I'm on my grind
