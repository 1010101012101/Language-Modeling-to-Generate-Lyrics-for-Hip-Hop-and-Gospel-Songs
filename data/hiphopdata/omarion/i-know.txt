With him thinkin' about me. 
 Huggin me and kissin' me. 
 Say that you're dreamin' 'bout me. 
 So what the hell ya doin' wit b? 
 On the phone, tellin' me what he does wrong. 
 Can't keep singin' that same song. 
 Girl, it's obvious that you need to be with me. 
 Baby, I know that you want me. 
 Know that you need me 
 Can't live without me. 
 But babe, you got a man. 
 And I know that you pretend that you're in love with him. 
 But, he can't put it down like me. 
 That's why I know that you want me. 
 Know that you need me. 
 Can't live without me 
 I know it's hard on you. 
 But you try to pretend that you're in love with him. 
 But I know that you really want me, girl. 
 Said ya at home all alone while he's gone. 
 Tryna act like what he doin' ain't wrong. 
 If your heart says follow him, then do it. 
 Baby girl, I'm just tryna help you through it. 
 4 months at a time, you don't see him. 
 Wishin that I switch places with him. 
 I'm not gonna press an issue. 
 Just let it be. 
 And if you're meant to be with me, we'll have to see. 
 Baby, I know that you want me. 
 Know that you need me 
 Can't live without me. 
 But babe, you got a man. 
 And I know that you pretend that you're in love with him. 
 But, he can't put it down like me. 
 That's why I know that you want me. 
 Know that you need me. 
 Can't live without me 
 I know it's hard on you. 
 But you try to pretend that you're in love with him. 
 But I know that you really want me, girl. 
 (Brige) 
 Baby girl if you're really feelin' me, here is where you'll need to really be. (girl we can't play these games) 
 And if you feel me say oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
 And if you feel me say ooh, oh, ooh, ooh, oh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh, whoa. 
 Baby, I know that you want me. 
 Know that you need me 
 Can't live without me. 
 But babe, you got a man. 
 And I know that you pretend that you're in love with him. 
 But, he can't put it down like me. 
 That's why I know that you want me. 
 Know that you need me. 
 Can't live without me 
 I know it's hard on you. 
 But you try to pretend that you're in love with him. 
 But I know that you really want me, girl.
