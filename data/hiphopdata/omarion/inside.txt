You got the power 
 Long as you want it 
 Long as you got me inside 
 You got the power 
 Long as you want it 
 Long as you got me inside 
 Girl are you crying? 
 Your moaning like that body is dying 
 The only lonely, thoughts your body's ever known, ooh 
 Girl we've been doing takes so long 
 My voice is almost gone 
 But if you need girl I can help you breath 
 And we can go on, on and on all night 
 That's tellin' me 
 It's worth the sacrifice 
 You got the power 
 Long as you want it 
 Long as you got me inside, 
 Got me inside 
 You gave your arms no denying 
 You sped it up then your body made it slowly down 
 Girl we been goin' up for so long 
 And every part of you is so soft 
 Girl when your eyes are closed 
 My love will help you see 
 And we can go on, on and on all night 
 That's tellin' me 
 It's worth the sacrifice, oh oh ooh 
 You got the power 
 Long as you want it 
 Long as you got me inside, 
 Got me inside 
 And we can go on, on and on all night 
 That's tellin' me 
 It's worth the sacrifice, oh oh ooh 
 You got the power 
 Long as you want it 
 Long as you got me inside, 
 Got me inside 
 You got the power 
 Long as you want it 
 Long as you got me inside, 
 Got me inside 
 Long as you got... 
 Lo lo lo long as you got... 
 Long as you got... 
 Lo lo lo long as you got... me inside...
