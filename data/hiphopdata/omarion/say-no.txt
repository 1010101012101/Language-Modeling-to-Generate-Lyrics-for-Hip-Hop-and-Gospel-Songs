You know the thing that hurts me the most 
 Is the simple fact that you can' t love me the way I love you... 
 Gone mentally, gone mentally, got me fucked up 
 Gone mentally, gone mentally, she got me fucked up 
 Eye sight full of lies 
 I don't know where my heart lies 
 When love's got a grip, it won't let go 
 It's not your choice, you can't leave, you can't say no 
 Say no, s-s-s-say no, you can't say no 
 Gave you my all, & I know you seen it 
 My eyes is bleeding, from the thought of you sleepin' 
 With another one, another her, another woman 
 Baby, girl I only needed you by yourself, by yourself 
 But instead of loving me, you wanted somebody else 
 When love's got a grip, it won't let go 
 It's not your choice, you can't leave, you can't say no 
 Say no, s-s-s-say no, you can't say no
