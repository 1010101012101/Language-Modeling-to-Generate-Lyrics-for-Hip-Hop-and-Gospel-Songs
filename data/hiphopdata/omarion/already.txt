Thank you, thank you for coming, 
 You could be with anyone else in the world 
 But you came with me 
 Girl I'm so anxious for you 
 I've been so patient with you 
 We don't need to rush we can take our time 
 You and me, you and me, you and me 
 You're here darling, and you're doing already 
 This song on your heels already 
 I don't know 'bout you girl but I'm ready 
 I can have a motherfucking helicopter scooping from the water to the land baby hold up 
 Breakfast in the morning more important bitches calling I ignore it, who done messed up 
 Baby sure enough 
 You telling me you might change 
 But I tell you not to 
 Baby I restyle girl with no one 
 Girl I'm so anxious for you 
 I've been so patient with you 
 Don't need to rush we can take our time 
 You and me, you and me, you and me 
 You're here darling, and you're doing already 
 This song on your heels already 
 I don't know 'bout you girl but I'm ready
