You tell me that you love me 
 And I say I love you, too 
 And I look right in your eyes, girl 
 And say I'll never cheat on you 
 And I go into the world 
 And the temptation begins 
 No, I don't wanna hurt you, girl 
 But there's a battle so deep within 
 But I fight for your love 
 Girl, I just can't give up 
 Looking at your pictures in my phone 
 Girl you know that ass is too much 
 Girl, you better not give my lovin' away 
 Girl, I told you I was here to stay 
 Girl, you make me feel some kind of way 
 You the shit, girl ain't nun else to say 
 It's too much, too much 
 Girl you know that it's too much, too much 
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 When we're together 
 You know it's the best feeling in the world 
 It's like I can't see nobody but you (yeah) 
 Feels like you're the only girl 
 And I go into the world 
 And the temptation begins 
 No, I don't wanna hurt you, girl 
 But there's a battle so deep within 
 But I fight for your love 
 Girl, I just can't give up 
 Looking at your pictures in my phone 
 Girl you know that ass is too much 
 Girl, you better not give my lovin' away 
 Girl, I told you I was here to stay 
 Girl, you make me feel some kind of way 
 You the shit, girl ain't nun else to say 
 It's too much, too much 
 Girl you know that it's too much, too much 
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
 One more time and I say 
 (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah... yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-ah)

 But I fight for your love

 Looking at your pictures in my phone
