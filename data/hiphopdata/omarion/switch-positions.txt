See these other dudes is into you 'cause you fine 
 And even that's fine, I don't mind all that 
 Me, I had fine my whole life 
 You can find that anywhere 
 It's about a little more than that over here 
 It's more than just a after-sex 
 Call me when you want something else 
 From something else 'til 
 Top off, trench coat 
 Slow it down, switch the tempo 
 White wine, in slow 
 Curtains open, let the neighbours watch us through the window 
 Lights out, candle lit 
 I'm tryna see what's up right now 
 Got me open as a fuck right now 
 Probably why I'm tryna fuck right now 
 I'll take that back, it's the wrong impression 
 But I bet you 30 minutes leave a long impression 
 Hair pulled, with your back arched 
 I ain't even gotta ask who's this is 
 Foolishness, you heaven sent 
 And it's evident how you do that shit 
 Got a compliment, yo confidence 
 'Cause I love how you exude that shit 
 Already know you the illest alive 
 You don't even shine to prove that shit 
 Call it training day, I know wifey proud of me 
 Told her I had a draining day, she suck the life right out of me 
 My turn, gon' eat it 
 Turn over, but I'm tryna keep it 
 Can't you see that I'm gonna give you everything? 
 Everything that you need 
 What I really feel is 
 Sexual healing is what I am giving you 
 I know that I'm a poke, girl wait 
 Switch positions, switch positions 
 I know that I'm a poke, girl wait 
 Switch positions 
 Let's do it 
 Tonight let's get it lusty 
 I wanna touch you 
 And if I make you my girlfriend I'm gonna cuff you 
 Maybe we can chill all day 
 Ride up on the beach and now I play 
 What you say? 
 (What you say?) 
 What you say? What you want? 
 What you need? Yea you know I got that for ya 
 Got that fire, anything I let you have 
 Just sex me 
 Full course meal, now the dinner gone 
 Closet full of clothes, still nothing but her skin is on 
 Don't matter if it's your place or my place 
 But if mine, the patio got a fireplace 
 Trust me, you ain't seen shit just yet 
 Not compared to how shit can get 
 Me on top of you dripping sweat 
 And that don't matter, you drippin' wet 
 Your turn, on top 
 And you can crash here, just promise me you won't stop 
 Can't you see that I'm gonna give you everything? 
 Everything that you need 
 What I really feel is 
 Sexual healing is what I am giving you 
 I know that I'm a poke, girl wait 
 Switch positions, switch positions 
 I know that I'm a poke, girl wait 
 Switch positions 
 Let's do it 
 Two rounds might lead to four 
 All depend on how you feel though 
 Me suckin' on you, all while you bitin' on that pillow 
 Same time next week but I asked her how she feel first 
 Said she wanted some days off, said she needed to heal first 
 She told me smack her ass like she was actin' up 
 I told her put it down, but she backed it up 
 Our turn, one forever 
 Arrive separate but come together 
 Can't you see that I'm gonna give you everything? 
 Everything that you need 
 What I really feel is 
 Sexual healing is what I am giving you 
 I know that I'm a poke, girl wait 
 Switch positions, switch positions 
 I know that I'm a poke, girl wait 
 Switch positions 
 Let's do it 
 Yea 
 You know? 
 I visualize 
 Every part of you 
 And I just 
 I can't help but to explore 
 Every part of you, yea
