Damn, I really messed up this time 
 But Imma make it up to you 
 Listen 
 Seems just like the other day 
 You were my woman 
 Shopping malls and holidays 
 Couldn't tell us nothing 
 Now you're gone away and I'm 
 Still trynna deny it 
 But I'm tired from this pain 
 And I just can't hide it 
 It's like ooh 
 I just can't get over you 
 Girl ooh 
 Feels like I caught the flu 
 Girl I'm sick from all these lies and these games 
 And I'm sick from being the reason we turned out this way 
 I'm tryna act like I don't wanna be with you 
 Like I would be okay 
 If you just walked away 
 I'm tryna act like I don't wanna see you 
 Like you were just a phase 
 I'll forget you in a day 
 I'm tryna act like I can do without feeling on your booty 
 Find another ghetto cutie 
 To do me like you do me yeah yeah yeah 
 But I'm just so addicted to you 
 Imma try but I can't 
 'Cause your all I'm tryna do 
 See ya here and there with your friends 
 And I start the frontin' 
 Act like I been doing my thing 
 I don't need your loving 
 But you see it in my eyes 
 Girl something just ain't right 
 Since we don't share this bed no more 
 I can't sleep at night 
 It's like ooh 
 I just can't get over you 
 Girl ooh 
 Feel like I caught the flu ooh 
 Girl I'm sick from all these lies and these games 
 And I'm sick from being the reason we turned out this way 
 I'm tryna act like I don't wanna be with you (ooh) 
 Like I would be okay (be okay) 
 If you just walked away (walked away) 
 I'm tryna act like I don't wanna see you (I don't wanna see you baby) 
 Like you were just a face 
 I'll forget you in a day 
 I'm tryna act like I can do without feeling on your booty (oh ho) 
 Find another ghetto cutie 
 To do me like you do me yeah yeah yeah 
 But I'm just so addicted to you 
 Imma try (oh) but I can't 
 'Cause you're all I'm tryna do 
 Baby I know 
 Guess I'm changing out the door (Can't play it off like I'm so cool) 
 Girl you know I'm going straight out my mind 
 I can't stop thinking 'bout the things we did and the way we kissed 
 I know it ain't right playin' like you ain't my time girl 
 Tryna be a playa got me actin' like I don't wanna be yeah yeah
