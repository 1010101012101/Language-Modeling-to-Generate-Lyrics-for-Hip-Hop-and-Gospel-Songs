I'll be long gone by the time you read this 
 I'll be long gone by the time you read this 
 What am I here for 
 What am I here for 
 I'll be long gone by the time you read this 
 I'll be long gone by the time you read this 
 What am I here for 
 What am I here for 
 You're all I need 
 You're all I need 
 You're all I need 
 And all I needed was you 
 I love you so much, but you just can't see it 
 I love you so much, but you just can't see it 
 What are you here for 
 What are you here for 
 When time passes 
 When time passes 
 I hope you see it 
 I hope you see it 
 I hope you see it 
 I hope you see it 
 You're all I need 
 You're all I need 
 You're all I need 
 And all I needed was you 
 You're all I need 
 You're all I need 
 You're all I need 
 And all I needed was you 
 Girl I'm gone 
 How do you feel 
 How do you feel 
 How does it feel 
 I want a bad girl tonight 
 Mischievous and clever 
 Caught up in my fame 
 Trying to capitalize on our time together 
 Acting like she bigger than she is 
 Looking seductive 
 Wanting me to sweat her 
 Playing hard to get know damn well she gon get in here 
 And do whatever I tell her
