 Can't escape what I'm feeling inside 
 So ain't no use a running 
 But (oh no) 
 I don't know if you feeling me the same 
 You gotta tell me something (gotta tell me something) 
 'Cause I don't wanna be in love with a girl 
 Who's way too busy fronting 
 I wanna go back to when 
 To when you were just a friend 
 No complications 
 Not my heart racing 
 When I see you baby 
 But it ain't the same cause now 
 I can't resist your smile 
 You got me buggin 
 I'm caught up in loving 
 And I know it's crazy but 
 (I, I) I wish I didn't love you

 Sometimes 
 I try to act like it ain't what it is 
 Girl I gotta face it 
 'Cause I ('Cause I got you all of the time that we shared) 
 And I don't wanna waste it (I won't even waste it babe) 
 You gotta hold on with dedication 
 So I won't even fight it (no I won't even fight it) 
 Girl you keep a smile on my face 
 And I be so excited 
 I wanna go back to when 
 To when you were just a friend 
 No complications 
 Not my heart racing 
 When I see you baby 
 But it ain't the same cause now 
 I can't resist your smile 
 You got me buggin 
 I'm caught up in loving 
 And I know it's crazy but
