911 got a call 
 Said hurry send the ambulance please 
 They asked me who was involved 
 And I told them that the victim was me 
 Stabbed me in the back and left me on the street 
 Now who would do this to me I 
 I thought the suspect got off clean 
 That's when they saw your finger prints on the scene oh 
 As much as I don't wanna believe it 
 Whatever it is it's plain to see 
 I don't wanna know the truth but I need it 
 And the jury finds you guilty guilty uh huh 
 For breaking my heart 
 You're guilty guilty uh huh 
 Like murder in the third degree 
 Oh shorty's a criminal (and I never seen it coming) 
 Wouldn't have guessed it for a hundred years 
 For years you did it 
 You even told me you admit it 
 But I told them not my baby 
 That's what they told me that's been happening daily 
 Mmm they threw the pictures out on the table 
 Wanted me to point you out but I wasn't able 
 'Cause I thought I fell in love with an angel 
 Never thought something so beautiful could be fatal 
 As much as I don't wanna believe it 
 Whatever it is it's plain to see (see) 
 I don't wanna know the truth but I need it (I need it) 
 And the jury finds you guilty guilty uh huh (oh whoa whoa ho) 
 For breaking my heart 
 You're guilty guilty uh huh 
 For breaking my heart yeah yeah 
 Like murder in the third degree (third degree) 
 Girl all the things you did to me 
 Should be a felony 
 They should lock you away and burn the key 
 Now all I do is sip Hennessy to get rid of memories 
 Cause every thought of you brings misery 
 Girl all the things you did to me 
 Should be a felony 
 They should lock you away and burn the key 
 Now all I do is sip Hennessy to get rid of memories 
 But I can't escape the fact that you're guilty yeah 
 As much as I don't wanna believe it 
 Whatever it is it's plain to see 
 I don't wanna know the truth but I need it 
 And the jury finds you guilty guilty uh huh 
 For breaking my heart 
 You're guilty guilty uh huh 
 Like murder in the third degree 
 Murder in the third degree I'm looonely 
 Nobody loves but you (fucked up) 
 Nobody ever loved me like you did 
 Nobody ever lied like you did 
 Like you did (like you did)
