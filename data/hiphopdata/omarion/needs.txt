1st verse: 
 At the movies one night, 
 Sportin applle bottom jeans and them gucci boots, 
 Saw you walkin' my way, 
 Some M&M's and a mountain dew, 
 Ooh wee you switch ya booty when you walk by, 
 Ya handcuffed to a nigga but its all right, girl before ya go, 
 Slide ya numba on the low 
 I wanna fool wit you, 
 Are you diwn wit that, wit no strings attached, 
 I wanna fool wit you, 
 Keep it on the low, 
 He ain't gotta know, 
 I wanna fool wit you, 
 Gotsta put it down, 
 When yo man ain't around, 
 I wanna fool wit you 
 2nd verse: 
 I see ya sittin' real close, 
 Got ya man on the side, 
 But we doin' the most, 
 Grip my hand on yo thigh, 
 So I can feel underneath your clothes, ain't nobody knowin' and it's so hot, 
 Got a nigga goin' baby don't stop, 
 You'll be more than just a lover, 
 But for now we undercover 
 3rd verse: 
 Can sneak out the exit door, 
 Go into the movies so he won't know, 
 When we sip on the cris, 
 I'll give you some of this, 
 Be back before the creidits roll, 
 You know I know, that you want me to grab that waiste, 
 And I know you know, 
 That I gotta get a taste 
 4th verse: 
 (Baby tonight I'll freak ya body right), I'm gonna freak ya body right, 
 I'm lovin' them lips them hips them sexy thighs, 
 Those sexy thighs, 
 Meet at my place so we ain't gotta hide, we ain't gotta hide so I can, 
 Fool wit you, fool wit you body honey 
 (Chorus out)
