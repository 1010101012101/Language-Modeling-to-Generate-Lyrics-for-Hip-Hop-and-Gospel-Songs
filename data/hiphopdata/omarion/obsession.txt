Obsession (My heart, heat go boom, boom tap) (x8) 
 Hey 
 Excuse me if I find my self dumb, looks like somebody else has my wife 
 So tell me where the fuck you came from (where you came from) 
 I never seen nothing like you in my life 
 So I close my eyes and try not to think of your eyes, not to think of your smile
