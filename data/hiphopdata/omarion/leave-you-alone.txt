Perfect love flew away days ago 
 Perfect lies, they can fly, they're gone... 
 I guess I gotta leave you alone, I gotta leave you alone, yeah 
 Special spark 
 Went away, now it's gone 
 I guess I gotta leave you alone, don't wanna leave you alone, yeah 
 Perfect hearts, they should shine when they glow 
 Everyone needs some time alone 
 Tell me why didn't I see it first 
 See the text on my phone in the dark 
 Tryna swallow my pride babe 
 Stole a little piece from my trust 
 I guess I gotta leave you alone, I gotta leave you alone, yeah 
 Special spark 
 Went away, and it's gone 
 I guess I gotta leave you alone, I gotta leave you alone, yeah 
 Perfect hearts, they should shine when they glow 
 Everyone needs some time alone 
 Don't let this go 
 Or was it all for nothing...? 
 Getting drunk in this room, in my zone 
 I should pick up this phone and call you here 
 See the tears, hit the floor, feel them flow 
 Selfish ways have me laying here alone 
 I can't stop thinking about, I can't stop thinking about you 
 Selfish ways have me laying here alone 
 I guess I gotta leave you alone, I gotta leave you alone, yeah 
 Special spark 
 Went away, and it's gone 
 I guess I gotta leave you alone, I gotta leave you alone, yeah 
 Perfect hearts, they should shine when they glow 
 Everyone needs some time alone 
 I guess I gotta leave you alone, I gotta leave you alone, yeah 
 Special spark 
 Went away, and it's gone 
 I guess I gotta leave you alone, I gotta leave you alone, yeah 
 Perfect hearts, they should shine when they glow 
 Everyone needs some time alone 
 Don't let this go 
 Or was it all for nothing?
