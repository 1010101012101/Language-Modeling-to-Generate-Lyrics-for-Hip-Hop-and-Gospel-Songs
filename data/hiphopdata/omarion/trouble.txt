 She in trouble, had to slide right up under her 
 Had to be the only reason I would punish her 
 Tried to avoid it, had her girlfriends come with her 
 But they gon wait up in that living room till I'm done with her 
 They gon sit tight baby no interruptions 
 While I'm knocking down her walls like they under construction 
 French on her nails with her hair done beautifully 
 And what the fuck you thought them boy shorts was gonna do to me? 
 Face like Megan little thicker than Hale 
 Had me up all night as if my dick's into molly 
 I know that our endeavor was fun 
 'Cause she stored me in her phone 
 As he can have it whenever he wants
