(Omarion Talking) 
 Yeah uh yeah 
 I don't know if y'all 
 Ready for this one right here 
 Omarion solo, y'all ain't ready 
 It's time tick tock tick tock 
 1, here comes the 2 to the 3 and 4 
 Girl yo body sick 
 You the hottest thang on the floor 
 You bustin' through them AppleBottom jeans 
 I can't stop getting next to you 'cause I'm a fein 
 Lookin' at my wrist, starin' at my pinky ring 
 Whispering in my ear real close 
 Sayin' kinky things 
 Tattoo on the small of you back 
 And ya booty so fat mami shake that 
 Damn 
 Shorty got a hold of me 
 Shorty tryna take control of me 
 Got me sayin' damn 
 Shorty wanna roll with me 
 Shorty wanna be involved with me 
 She got me like damn 
 (Repeat) 
 Now we sneakin out the back door of the club 
 Girl I know you tipsy 
 Homie rollin' with me simply swiftly 
 'Cause she feelin' in love when she kissed me 
 Just one touch and shorty was history 
 And I ain't tryna brag or boast but ya body jivey 
 Need a good lovin' from a somebody 
 And the way you was moving I could see you know 
 What you doin' girl let's get to it girl 
 Whoo, whoo, yeah y'all ain't ready Omarion yeah whoo damn damn
