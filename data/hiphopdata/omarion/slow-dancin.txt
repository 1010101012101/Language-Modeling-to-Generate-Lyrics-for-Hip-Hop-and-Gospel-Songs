 See you across the room

 Stepped to the DJ quick

 Just give me the chance 
 To put my hands 
 On you 
 Made the DJ slow it down 
 So I can put my arms around you 
 Had to get you next 2 me 
 Girl we about to be 
 Doing our thing 
 Slow dancing 
 Bumping and grinding and maybe (maybe) 
 Romancing 
 So into you 
 And I'm, trancin' 
 Hands on your waist 
 We face to face 
 Slowww dancing 
 Bumping and grinding and maybe 
 Romancing

 And I'm whispering (oh!)
