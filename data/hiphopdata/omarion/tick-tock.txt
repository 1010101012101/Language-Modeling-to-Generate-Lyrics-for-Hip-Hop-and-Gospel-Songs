I don't really wanna hurt nobody, 
 I'm just tryna get up in this party, 
 I wanna dance with a little short hottie, 
 Take her to the back and make her say ai, 
 So I step up to the club in my robe, 
 Everybody be like damn there her go, 
 Boy lookin' so fresh so here we go, 
 Beep beep, 
 Who got the keys to my jeep? 
 Rawwwrr, 
 Top down out sounds
