Curse them vicky secrets you wearing for make me feel so inferior 
 And curse that little bottle coco butter that blesses your exterior 
 Whoa 
 I can see the way your lingerie is looking, you just trying to test me 
 And I don't like the way them dollar bills are sliding up down your body 
 They make me so jealous but it can't happen 
 Girl just go and get it call me foolish or even selfish 
 But baby I can't fight the way I feel 
 That pole should be my body 
 This floor should be my bed 
 Everything they throwing baby girl ill double it 
 This club should be my crib 
 You're my private dancer 
 You're my private dancer 
 Throwing 100 when I should throwing 1s 
 Throwing 100 when I should throwing 1s 
 Throwing 100 when I should throwing 1s 
 Throwing 100 when I should throwing 1s 
 Girl I hate the way that your necklace is hanging like it's coming on to you 
 And I know that them earring you wearing are whispering all the nasty things I wanna do to you 
 I can't help but feel a little angry 'bout the bottle on your lips 
 And who gave you permission to get them roses and bible tattooed on your hips 
 They make me so jealous but it can't happen 
 Girl just go and get it call me foolish or even selfish 
 But baby I can't fight the way I feel 
 That pole should be my body 
 This floor should be my bed 
 Everything they throwing baby girl ill double it 
 This club should be my crib 
 You're my private dancer 
 You're my private dancer 
 Throwing 100 when I should throwing 1s 
 Get mad when I know I should be having fun 
 Lately I've been tripping thinking that you're the one 
 They make me so jealous but it can't happen 
 Girl just go and get it call me foolish or even selfish 
 But baby I can't fight the way I feel 
 That pole should be my body 
 This floor should be my bed 
 Everything they throwing baby girl ill double it 
 This club should be my crib 
 You're my private dancer 
 You're my private dancer 
 Throwing 100 when I should throwing 1s 
 Throwing 100 when I should throwing 1s 
 Throwing 100 when I should throwing 1s 
 Throwing 100 when I should throwing 1s
