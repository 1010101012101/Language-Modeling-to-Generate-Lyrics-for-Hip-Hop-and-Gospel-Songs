Im staring at the pillow where you slept last night 
 It was almost like you were laying there 
 And the shirt that you wore of mine 
 Took it off and threw it across the chair 
 Now its kinda hard to get you off my mind 
 When I keep seeing you everywhere 
 For example like that lipstick on that glass of wine, damn 
 Sitting right over there 
 And I can't play it off like we're friends like I used to 
 No, I can't pretend like I used to 
 So now I'm laying in my bed thinking 'bout you 
 And what do I do 
 Girl, I'm feeling like I'm coming down with the case of you 
 Now, it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes 
 I feel so weak, so hard to breath 
 But it only seems to happen when you leave, girl 
 Ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do 
 I'm coming down with the case of you 
 Trying not to think about you only got me missing you more 
 And loneliness ain't no cure 
 Though it was over about now 
 But no, not yet 
 Pulled the covers up to my head 
 Now I'm feeling dizzy, and my mouth is dry 
 With just the thought of you on my mind 
 Its kinda crazy, what a mess I'm in 
 I can't believe this is happening 
 And I can't play it off like we're friends like I used to 
 No, I can't pretend like I used to 
 So now I'm laying in my bed thinking 'bout you 
 Girl, I'm feeling like I'm coming down with the case of you 
 Now, it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes 
 I feel so weak, so hard to breath 
 But it only seems to happen when you leave, girl 
 Ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do 
 I'm coming down with the case of you 
 Now this ain't no common cold 
 What I feel is original 
 And I know there is a remedy 
 When you bring your body back to me 
 Girl, I'm feeling like I'm coming down with the case of you 
 Now, it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes 
 I feel so weak, so hard to breath 
 But it only seems to happen when you leave, girl 
 Ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do 
 I'm coming down with the case of you 
 Girl, I'm feeling like I'm coming down with the case of you 
 Now, it started in my head but it trickled down to my shoes 
 I feel so weak, so hard to breath 
 But it only seems to happen when you leave, girl 
 Ain't nobody ever had me feeling quite like you do 
 I'm coming down with the case of you
