Ha ha ha 
 Yeah 
 Everytime I need some love 
 I run to you 
 I run straight to you 
 Because your love is true 
 Yeah 
 Girl nobody else can make me feel the way you do 
 Because the way you do 
 Because your love is true 
 Oh girl your loves the truth 
 I like the way you touch me 
 I like the way you feel 
 I'm glad that we're together 
 This here feels so real 
 Nobody ever told me 
 That it could feel like this 
 That I could find heaven, heaven with a kiss 
 Whoa girl, you are the one that is sold out 
 Your what my momma was talkin' bout 
 Oh baby girl you got me 
 Oh damn I'm so addicted 
 Addicted to you girl 
 Sometimes it even scares me 
 That you've become my world 
 People think I'm crazy 
 They say I'm in too deep 
 There's more than meets the eye 
 That they could ever see 
 Whoa girl, you are the one that is sold out 
 Your what my momma was talkin' bout 
 Oh baby girl you got me 
 Oh girl, aye, whoa 
 Everytime I need some love 
 I run to you 
 I run straight to you 
 Because your love is true 
 Everytime I turn around 
 Ooh, you're right there (x2) 
 You pretty girl 
 So fine, yeah, uh
