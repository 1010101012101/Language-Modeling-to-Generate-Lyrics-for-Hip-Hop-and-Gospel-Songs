I get the girls that's pretty in face 
 Real nice booty, still skinny in the waste 
 I like the way she move when she shake it in my face 
 (It's a code red when we move up in the place) 
 Steady coming in and they all got friends 
 Couldn't be the alcohol, it's the beauty to blame 
 Pop this bottle passing out rose 
 (It's to many girls, VIP is going crazy) 
 Like race cars, we stopping them 
 Like Cop cars (Code red, code red, code red) 
 It's a code red. 
 Steeze so fresh, lil mama's like wow 
 Baby I'm a king, I'm a hand you dis crown 
 Number one lady, baddest chick in the city 
 They all look witty, it's about to get silly 
 Trapped in the corner, baby putting on me 
 I'm coppin hella feelz I can tell that she want me 
 She's a very freaky girl, don't bring her to momma, 
 First you get the name, and then you get the numba
