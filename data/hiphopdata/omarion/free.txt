I'm free, I'm free, so free 
 I'm free! 
 Free from all this guilt I held inside, 
 How could you look me in my eyes and just lie? 
 Kept me hostage for your own salvation, 
 I'm no longer there, I won't be gone and... 
 'Cause I'm free! 
 She said 'I'm free!' 
 She said 'I'm free!' 
 She said 'I'm free!' 
 Baby, wait for me! (x4)
