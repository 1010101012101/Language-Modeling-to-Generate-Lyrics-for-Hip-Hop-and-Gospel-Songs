Been on the losing side 
 This time I'll turn the tide 
 This time I won't give up 
 No baby 
 This time I'm in control 
 I want the whole world to know 
 Ain't know one to slow me down this time 
 This worlds gonna be my light 
 There's a brand new stream I've found 
 And I ain't looking back 
 And if the river's too wide, I'll get through it 
 And if the mountain's too high, that won't stop the stream of mine 
 I'm on my way, I've got a plan 
 I'm making my way any way that I can 
 This time around (This Is It Baby) 
 Stand my ground, live my dream 
 I've relised how I lie deep in me... 
 I will never turn at one, 
 There's nothing I can over come 
 Lets theses cats keep bumping dawns 
 I'll just grind on and get it done 
 I will never turn as one 
 There's nothing I can't overcome 
 Ain't nothing to slow me down this time 
 Sweet faith is on side 
 Giving it all I got 
 Blinding is dead 
 Straight to the top I'll get trought it (Cum'on Baby) 
 And if the river's too wide, I'll get through it 
 And if the mountain's too high, that won't stop the stream of mine 
 I'm on my way, I've got a plan 
 I'm making my way any way that I can
