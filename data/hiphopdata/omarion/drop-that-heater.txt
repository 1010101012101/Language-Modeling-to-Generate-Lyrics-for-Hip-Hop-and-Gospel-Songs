(Hook) 2xs 
 Girl I know you want to give it to me 
 You got something I can't deny 
 Oh want you drop it so I can see 
 Damn I can tell that you're not shy 
 She's all over me 
 Like a steal grown mammal 
 Waitin' to bust off 
 It just won't jam her 
 She's ready to be 
 Throwed out of handle 
 Stickin' up panicin' 
 If she get sweater 
 I can tell that she knows (knows) 
 Everthing in the club 
 Wishin I can switch places with her 
 Get my attention like I'm giving to her 
 Tellin' me to come take off her choltes 
 Got me sayin' 
 (Chorus) 2xs 
 Drop that heater 
 Bop off the meter 
 Get all in her 
 Shorty's callin me 
 And I got to go get her 
 To the girl's room 
 She's tellin' me to come on 
 She's ready to drive 
 She can drop for off 
 If you play it smooth 
 Till the last girl come up 
 We can slide in and lock the door 
 She's not ready to go 
 Leaning over the stall 
 Tellin' me to be so timid with her 
 She's waited a long time to fill it up 
 And she don't want to hear the word "NO" 
 Got me sayin' 
 (Chorus) 2xs 
 There's no way 
 That you'll movin' 
 Got me want to leave up out of here 
 And take it to a favorite thang 
 And I got something I need you to feel 
 And I know that you know exactly what it is 
 Here it go 
 (Hook) 2xs 
 Girl I know you want to give it 2 me 
 You got something I can't deny 
 Oh want you drop it so I can see 
 Damn I can tell that you're not shy 
 (Chorus) 4xs 
 (Hook) 2xs
