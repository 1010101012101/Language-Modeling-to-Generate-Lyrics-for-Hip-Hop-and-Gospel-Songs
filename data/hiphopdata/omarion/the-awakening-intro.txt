What up y'all 
 It's the one and only aka Luke Skywalker 
 Embrace the awakening (I'm on some new shit) 
 Yo look this is not an experience 
 This is my life 
 Open up to you guys like a book 
 Let's read 
 And it reads (I'm on some new shit) 
 It's time to revelate our boundaries 
 Our perceptions 
 And change everything (I'm on some new shit) 
 I am fearless and unafraid 
 This is... the awakening 
 You know 'Mari 
 Alot of artist have come on go 
 Since you've been here 
 I mean since you were a young boy (man) 
 Alot of artist that's still here 
 Even had a chance to wake up 
 They still sleepin' 
 Career and everything 
 So with that bein' said 
 I got you on this new beginning 
 This new music 
 This new movement 
 This is the awakening 
 Time to rise up people... let's go
