Midnight... mmm... Uhhhmmm... 
 It started out like any other day 
 But it was any thing but 
 Something 'bout the way the moon was shining 
 Something seemed so different ooh 
 Got in the car but didn't have no reason 
 Swear I was driving but something else was leading me 
 Lost all track of time damn the next thing you won't believe 
 At 9 o'clock I saw her 
 By 10 I had her number 
 11's when I called her 
 At 12 o'clock it happened I gotta blame 
 Midnight 
 I was caught up 
 It's like I couldn't help myself 
 If I wanted to 
 Blame it on midnight 
 If she found out about it would it be a good excuse 
 Midnight 
 It's 12 o'clock tick tock tick the clothes drop she's on top 
 And I don't even wanna stop no 
 It made me disregard and break my baby's heart 
 I know I did wrong but I blame it on midnight. 
 I'm still here I know I'm in trouble 
 But I'm a finish what I started 
 My heart is telling me to leave here 
 But my body's saying stay longer 
 We going strong while my cell phone blowing up 
 I know it's wrong but something else was leading me 
 Lost all track of time damn the sex is just too good to leave 
 At 1 o'clock I'm in it 
 2 o'clock still in it 
 And 3 o'clock I'm finished 
 At 4 o'clock I'm driving home I gotta blame 
 Midnight 
 I was caught up it's like I couldn't help myself if I wanted to 
 Blame it on midnight 
 If she found out about it would it be a good excuse 
 Midnight 
 It's 12 o'clock tick tock tick the clothes drop she's on top and I don't even wanna stop no 
 It made me disregard and break my baby's heart 
 I know I did wrong but I blame it on midnight. 
 What have you done it's 5:00 A.M. ooh 
 Hooking up with somebody that you don't even know 
 How you gonna get yourself outta this one 
 You got a girl at home 
 I can blame it on my car breaking down or 
 I can say that I was working late and didn't know 
 That you was waiting up I never showed up 
 Girl I know it's my fault blame it on 
 Midnight 
 I was caught up it's like I couldn't help myself if I wanted to 
 Blame it on midnight 
 If she found out about it would it be a good excuse 
 Midnight 
 It's 12 o'clock tick tock tick the clothes drop she's on top and I don't even wanna stop no 
 It made me disregard and break my baby's heart 
 I know I did wrong but I blame it on midnight.
