Sip until we faded 
 And just like it's your birthday I'm elated 
 Eager we celebrate it 
 I hear your body calling me 
 Feel free to release your freak 
 It's no need to keep waiting 
 I'm gripping on your curves like I'm racing 
 Keep feeding you motivation 
 You go girl you are all I need 
 Explore all your fantasies 
 Just take a ride, Just take a ride, Just take a ride with me 
 Girl let me dive, girl let me dive, I wanna swim in your sea 
 Tell me how you feel and keep it real and I'll never leave you lonely 
 Sex you like on repeat, close your eyes and you'll see 
 Just let me have my way girl don't be scared 
 'Cause I just wanna love ya (just wanna love ya) 
 In between the covers (between the covers) 
 There will be no panties in my bed 
 'Cause I just wanna love ya (just wanna love ya) 
 In between the covers (between the covers) 
 Got my hormones racing 
 And in between your legs is my location 
 You say it's been so vacant 
 I bring that flow you've never knew 
 Got your legs up to the moon 
 Sweet love is all you tasting 
 You throw it back girl I like it like that 
 Might need some ventilation 
 It's getting hot but girl it's cool 
 Give you what you'll need times two 
 Just take a ride, Just take a ride, Just take a ride with me 
 Girl let me dive, girl let me dive, I wanna swim in your sea 
 Tell me how you feel and keep it real and I'll never leave you lonely 
 Sex you like on repeat, close your eyes and you'll see 
 Just let me have my way girl don't be scared 
 'Cause I just wanna love ya (just wanna love ya) 
 In between the covers (between the covers) 
 There will be no panties in my bed 
 'Cause I just wanna love ya (just wanna love ya) 
 In between the covers (between the covers) 
 In between the covers 
 I will love you like no other baby 
 Promise to do you right 
 We can make it last all night 
 Hope you ready girl 
 I wanna take you on that flight 
 In between the covers 
 I will love you like no other baby 
 Promise to do you right 
 We can make it last all night 
 Hope you ready girl 
 I wanna take you on that flight 
 Just let me have my way girl don't be scared 
 'Cause I just wanna love ya (just wanna love ya) 
 In between the covers (between the covers) 
 There will be no panties in my bed 
 'Cause I just wanna love ya (just wanna love ya) 
 In between the covers (between the covers) 
 Just wanna love ya 
 Just wanna love ya 
 Just wanna love ya 
 Between the covers 
 I just wanna love you 
 I just wanna love you 
 I just wanna love you 
 Between the covers 
 Between the covers 
 I just wanna love you 
 I just wanna love you 
 I just wanna love you 
 Between the covers 
 Between the covers
