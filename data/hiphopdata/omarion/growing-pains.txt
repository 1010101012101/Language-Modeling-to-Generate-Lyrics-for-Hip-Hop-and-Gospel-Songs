I can't live with you, but I can't live without ya 
 Not breathing with you, it hard to breathe without ya 
 Think to myself everyday 
 How they split us apart, four different men that shared the same heart 
 It had to happen this way 
 Us go our separate way 
 Would be lying if I said I didn't miss col-fax days 
 Sit and think to myself how this thing has changed my life 
 (Damn we was suppose to be boys for life) 
 This is my growin' pains 
 Cause by the fortune and fame 
 Thought we'd be together forever and ever and ever 
 Never thought we'd go our separate ways 
 Now look how things have changed 
 Looks like there never ever be the same 
 So hard to explain what went wrong? 
 After we were together for too long 
 Now, never be the same again 
 Tell me how this thing happened 
 Damn, this is my growin' pain 
 Some people don't know 
 That I tried it again 
 Even though I was sour (sour) 
 I tried to be a man (man) 
 I couldn't hold a grudge, knowing in my heart I still had love 
 But If y'all knew what went down you'd be like what the fuck 
 They say you don't know what you got until it's gone 
 Loyalty, honesty, where did we go wrong? 
 I guess it was God's grace for me to be alone. 
 This is my growin' pains 
 Cause by the fortune and fame 
 Thought we'd be together forever and ever and ever 
 Never thought we'd go our separate ways 
 Now look how things have changed 
 Looks like there never ever be the same 
 So hard to explain what went wrong? 
 After we were together for too long 
 Now, never be the same again 
 Tell me how this thing happened 
 Damn, this is my growin' pain 
 How could this ever be, them no longer a part of me? 
 What did you do to turn them other boys against me? 
 I just have one thing to say 
 What you do comes back your way 
 So many things were said, so many false statements about me against my manager Chris. Sometimes I just feel like giving up. Like I was nothing and Like I couldn't go on without them. But know I feel like God is looking down on me and he should carry my soul. As I take this solo journey, I never meant for any of this to happen ... I'm sorry, but I have no regrets. 
 This is my growin' pains (I have no regrets)

 Now, never be the same again
