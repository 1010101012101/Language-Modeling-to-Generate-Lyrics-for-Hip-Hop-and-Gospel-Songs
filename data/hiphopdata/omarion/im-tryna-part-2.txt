Damn (damn, yepp) 
 I can't believe this is happening to me 
 (It's another one of those classics) 
 Like it happens, all right? 
 Omarion, Bow wow, I'm tryna! part 2 
 Bow wow 
 Damn, so this is how it's going down 
 Me and you ain't talking now 
 What about everything we've been through 
 You just gon' go throw all this out? 
 What about the good times we did have 
 Harder times that I made you laugh 
 What about the times when I cheered you up 
 When you was hurt and you was sad 
 Yeah 
 Omarion 
 Seems like yesterday you were my woman 
 Shopping malls and holidays could'nt tell us nothing 
 Now you're all up in my house wit another brother 
 And I'm thinking to myself I'm out to kill this motherfucker 
 And I say girl I'm sorry, even though I know it's late for apologies 
 Babe how could you do this to me, you was supposed to have my baby 
 I'm tryna act like I don't wanna be with you, 
 Like I would be ok if you just walked away 
 I'm tryna act like I don't wanna see you 
 Like you was just a phase, I forget you in a couple of days 
 Tryna act like I can do without feeling on yo booty 
 Find another ghetto cutie, to do me like you do me baby 
 Girl I'm just so addicted to you, 
 Imma try but I can't, 'cause you're all I'm tryna do 
 Yeah yeah 
 I see you here and there with your friends and I start that frontin' 
 Act like I've been doin' my thing and I don't need your lovin' 
 But I see it in your eyes girl you want me back, 
 And I give anything just to have you back 
 Memories that you got you're my homie, 
 I don't know what to do, you confuse me 
 Girl this is crazy you're supposed to have my baby 
 I'm tryna act like I don't wanna be with you, 
 Like I would be ok if you just walked away 
 I'm tryna act like I don't wanna see you (see you) 
 Like you was just a phase, I forget you in a couple of days 
 (Couple of days) 
 Tryna act like I can do without feeling on yo booty 
 Find another ghettocutie, to do me like you do me 
 Yeah yeah yeah girl I'm just so addicted to you, 
 Imma try but I can't, 'cause you're all I'm tryna do 
 Bow wow: 
 Yeah, I've done a lot of things wrong, 
 But I guess that's something I gotta live with 
 If I could then I would turn back the hands of time girl 
 I would'nt ever have did this 
 I guess what they say is true, you don't know what you got until it's gone 
 Now I'm sitting here all alone, wishing that's she'll come back home 
 But she ain't coming back, homie ain't no cure for that 
 A woman can take so much and once it get to that point, she gone like that 
 I'm tryna be the best I can, I'm tryna be a better man 
 I'm tryna act like I don't wanna be with you, 
 Like I would be ok if you just walked away 
 I'm tryna act like I don't wanna see you (I don't wanna see you girl) 
 Like you was just a phase, I forget you in a couple of days 
 (Forget you in a couple of days) 
 Tryna act like I can do without feeling on yo booty 
 Find another ghettocutie, to do me like you do me 
 Yeah yeah yeah girl I'm just so addicted to you, 
 Imma try but I can't 'cause you're all I'm tryna do... 
 Ah, yeah...
