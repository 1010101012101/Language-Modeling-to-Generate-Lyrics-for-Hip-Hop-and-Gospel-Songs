 Super 
 You can feel the pain on a young nigga you hear me? 
 Future Hendix 
 Young rich nigga 
 Fucking bad bitches 
 That's all I know (that's all I know) 
 It's sad to say that 
 Hendrix 
 This couldn't be love, man 
 This couldn't be love 
 Check out the way I be glistening yah 
 Four-door Bugatti, you mention me yah 
 Diamonds they drapped in my portfoli-yah 
 Fill up a safe, I'm more realer than yah 
 Fuck my new case, I'm more realer than yah 
 Ace by the case, I'm more realer than yah 
 Sleep with the K, I'm more realer than yah 
 A regular day, I'm more chiller than yah 
 Diamonds on freeze, ain't gon never thaw out 
 Niggas talk shit, ain't gon never be found 
 Counting it up and I'm losing the count 
 Fuck all this 'Tussin, this Act I'ma down 
 Strappin it up with a whole hundred rounds 
 Sackin it up, ain't no fucking around 
 We get that guap, ain't no fucking around 
 Ice on below, this ain't regular ice 
 Hop on a private, ain't regular flights 
 Smash on your hoe, this is everyday life 
 I filled the safe up from cooking the white 
 Fall out the pyrex, the cake and the bowl 
 You shoot at fame, y'all ain't taking my soul 
 Came in the game, I was hot as a stove 
 Pour out some lean, I'm trynna let it go 
 Rocking Celine from her to her toe 
 Fur on her back, in the summer she cold 
 VVs gon' light up and glisten, they glow 
 Blinding your eyesight, you never gon' see 
 Came out the 6, damn my diamonds on fleek 
 I made a mill in the middle of the week 
 I sell a chicken in the middle of the street 
 When I drop Patek the murder rate increase 
 Fuck all that poppin',' I stay with some bands 
 Shawty so yellow, she stay with a tan 
 Diamonds on me, got some rocks on my hand 
 Fuck the police, gotta stay with the can 
 I drop the top off a regular Wraith 
 Shawty on Perc, this a drug at a day 
 I got the torch, I can't give it away 
 Ain't no remorse, you get hit in the face 
 Check out the way I be glistening yah 
 Four-door Bugatti, you mention me yah

 Strappin it up with a whole hundred rounds 
 Sackin it up, ain't no fucking around 
 We get that guap, ain't no fucking around 
 Four-door Bugatti, you mention a G 
 Brand new Millennium, might hit the streets 
 I stacked it up, get to having a feast 
 I ran it up like Serena with me 
 Like it's Venus with me 
 Got the Nina with me 
 We screaming 'Freebandz,' this money ain't free 
 I cook it up, I'ma cook up a key 
 When I cook up a key I'ma charge you a fee 
 I did it first, it ain't none but a trend 
 Swerve on a curb, it ain't none but a Benz 
 I was on 2 two then I took it to 10 
 Keep in one thou, rep the gang in the pen' 
 Shoot at the police, ain't coming back home 
 Down for my crew if they right or they're wrong 
 Get to that money, that's all I condone 
 Shoot at your top, you ain't fucking with homes 
 We hit the block, had a bag full of stones 
 Jugged off a bale before I made a song 
 They ain't gon' tell you how I got it on 
 I'm not a failure, I'm deep in my zone 
 Paraphernalia, I serve you a chrome 
 Super exclusive when I put it on 
 We getting zooted where I'm coming from 
 Toasting that lean like it's Dom Perignon 
 Check out the way I be glistening yah
