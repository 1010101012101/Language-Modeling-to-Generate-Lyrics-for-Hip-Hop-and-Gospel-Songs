 Stunt on the block, same spot 
 Pull up and count up the knots (knots) 
 Niggas out here straight pie 
 If you hanging with a group of guys 
 Better make sure they gon' ride 
 I pull up like

 None of your traps exist, nigga 
 Selling that snort to your bitch, nigga 
 That ain't making my dick bigger 
 Count it up and drop it on that fist, nigga 
 Look at your unc with that itch 
 Pop that, a nigga won't twitch 
 Might as well pop at 'em first 'cause once you press 'em they gon' say they ain't said that shit man

 Make you and the Draco French kiss 
 Can't stand a dirty ass kitchen 
 Broke up with my mistress 
 Took the fork and I bent it 
 Had a Panamera on Emmit's

 Still her heart away like penny 
 Skrrt, yeah, that is the sound

 Momma depend on me, I ain't got kids 
 I gotta make it back home 
 One phone call will get you killed 
 I ain't even gotta scroll 
 Had apartment with no furniture 
 But at least I had a stove 
 Turned (?) to whitewater 
 'Bout to get this splash on 
 Other day I walked into Gucci 
 Told them folks that I'm back home 
 Got the city on my backbone 
 Black on like sea bone 
 Money calling, check the ringtone 
 Phil Jackson with the rings on
