We are denied not only civil rights, but even human rights. So the only way we're going to get some of this exploitation away from us, or aside from us... Who taught you to hate the race that you belong to? So much so that you don't want to be around each other. Who taught you to hate the texture of your hair? Who taught you to hate the color of your skin? 
 Fabrics, fabrics (Whoo) 
 Expensive, linen (Linen) 
 Put that bitch in the kitchen, in the kitchen whippin' 
 Back in the days, I was doin' lord willin'

 Every time your bitch phone rings she workin' (brr-brr) 
 Get no playin' time, Kendrick Perkins 
 Rockin' Timbs like I'm in New Jersey (Jersey)

 Up real early, servin', servin', servin' 
 Fuck that bitch, she a virgin (Smash) 
 Said she had to go to work, she was nursin' (Nursin') 
 I can turn the pot to the armed service (Service) 
 I declare war on your whole 30 
 Choppa hold a hunnid 
 If I wasn't real, I would be a hunnid 
 So that mean everything authentic ('Thentic) 
 Every car I get, windows presidented (Presidented)
