This is a story about a scarlet letter... yeah 
 It just hit me as I laid my head down 
 No one around in the dark cold night, I hear a sound 
 In my head repeat track of everything you've ever said 
 Must be something, but it's nothing, so I just go back to bed 
 It's 4, crack the door to the hallways in my dreams 
 But it seems my hallway keeps closing in on me 
 Forcing me out, making me think about you and how you're gone 
 I see 4:05 in teary eyes and then I write this song 
 And I just can't believe it has to be this way 
 You know we say it seems to me that it was just the other day 
 I saw your face, I saw your light, you ran the race, you fought the fight 
 But now it's all being torn down for me tonight 
 And I know it might be a little selfish for me to say 
 But I need to know if you've thought of me at all today 
 Cause every day walk past the place you lived 5 days of the week 
 And now it's 10 after 4 and I am taken by sleep 
 Spending hours on end, deciding what I'd say to a friend if I ever saw him again 
 'Cause I don't if I know, don't want to come across the wrong way 
 And I don't know if I know, but I know I want to see your face today 
 And somebody told me they saw you cry and break down 
 Do you know how hard that is to get around and think about? 
 It's not like you to let emotions get the best of things 
 Especially when everything is hanging in the air we breathe 
 And I just can't believe it has to be this way 
 You know we say it seems to me that it was just the other day 
 I saw your face and saw your light, you ran the race, you fought the fight 
 But now it's all being torn down for me tonight 
 And I know it might be a little selfish for me to say 
 But I need to know if you thought of me at all today 
 Cause every day walk past the place you lived 5 days of the week 
 And now it's 10 after 4 and I am taken by sleep 
 I'll sing a song to you, my friend 
 I'll sing a song to you, my friend 
 I'll sing a song to you, my friend 
 I'll sing a song to you, my-- Let's go! 
 Friend, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 I'll sing a song to you my friend 
 I'll sing a song to you my friend 
 I'll sing a song to you my friend 
 I'll sing a song to you my friend
