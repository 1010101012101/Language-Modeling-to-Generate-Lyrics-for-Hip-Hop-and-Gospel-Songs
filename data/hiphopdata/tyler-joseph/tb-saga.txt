 Nacho bell grande 
 Cheesy gordita 
 I like your nachos 
 Like diarrhea 
 Man I really like 
 Taco bell 
 I know I can't 
 Watch you make my food 
 Drop it on the floor 
 I think it's rude 
 Man I really like 
 Taco bell

 Jay Joseph: 
 Rob the taco store and ask 'em for a refill 
 Hey this is JRizzle 
 Listen up all y'all 
 I'm winning tacos just because of this gumball 
 I put chalupas where my mouth is 
 So watch this 
 Because I'm the dopest rapper 
 That you've ever messed with 
 Sir, welcome to Taco Bell 
 May I take your order 
 Yeah can I have a big mac and a pepsi 
 Sir we don't sell big macs 
 And some chicken nuggets 
 We don't have chicken nuggets either 
 Serious? 
 T-A-C-O B-E double L 
 The cashier's name is Omar Vizquel 
 People always 
 Persecute me 
 But I know they'll die 
 For eating Chipotle 
 How is it that you 
 Could hate 
 Good old taco bell 
 And how is it that you 
 Could like Chipotle 
 We walked into the Taco Bell 
 Because I was craving some crunchy shell 
 The man behind the counter said oopah (oopah) 
 I was flying as high as a kite 
 And I looked up to my delight 
 They were having a special on chalupas 
 My chalupa 
 My chalupa 
 My chalupa 
 My chalupa 
 And as you know there was a man 
 Who preached the truth 
 On rock and sand 
 And Jesus won't hold you sins to you 
 And we all know he broke the bread 
 But I know that St. Peter said 
 That his favorite food was chalupas 
 My chalupa 
 My chalupa 
 My chalupa 
 My chalupa 
 I love this song 
 Beef 
 It's a good song 
 And Cheese 
 Beef and cheese

 Beef and cheese in a taco shell yeah 
 Beef and cheese in a taco shell 
 Take that it'll make you fat 
 We got the stuff that'll your booty go 
 Take that it'll make you fat 
 We got the stuff that'll your booty go 
 Take that it'll make you fat 
 We got the stuff that'll your booty go 
 Take that it'll make you fat 
 We got the stuff that'll your booty go

 Now is the time 
 That we end this song 
 Without tacos 
 Life would be wrong 
 Man I really love taco bell 
 Michael was right 
 Tacos are great 
 If you're real hunger 
 They're open real late 
 Man I really love taco bell
