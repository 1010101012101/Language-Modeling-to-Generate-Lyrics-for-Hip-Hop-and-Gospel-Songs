I won't take much of your time 
 I just want you to see 
 What I have made inside these lines 
 It's as good as I can be 
 It's as good as I can be 
 This is all that I can be 
 This is all that I can be 
 All that I can be 
 Head tilted down, knees on the ground 
 And I will ask, '"Please... SAVE! Save me! Please, save, save! Save, save, save, save, save, save, save. Save me, save me, save me, save me, save me, save me.'" 
 I deserve for you to turn away 
 I was ashamed to speak Your name 
 I can't believe that all you see 
 Is that you have covered me gracefully 
 You're all I want to be 
 You're all I want to be 
 You're all I'll ever need 
 You're all I'll ever need 
 Jesus... Jesus... please... SAVE! 
 Save me! Save, save, save! Save, save, save, save, save, save, save. Save me, save me, save me. Save me, save me, save me... 
 I won't take much of your time... 
 Just enough, for you to save me
