(U-God) 
 On the mat head to toe 
 Intacked on the track 
 Big hat's on the go 
 Let them hoe's no we on the stro 
 We on the track 
 The shit we started we comin' back 
 In the market of rap 
 Walkin' man heart talkin' 
 Superbowl race suna-so-king 
 Roll the red carpet 
 Out the cockpit 
 Sharks are gettin' darmit 
 Come out the closet "ROCKS!" 
 My pocket's don't understand lin 
 Place's I haven't been 
 This is it HollyWood handprint 
 Written isn't it 
 Bottum is get that lid 
 Get that money not the honey rent 
 Need to feed is more legale 
 Ya too foxy ass 
 Get that cash 
 "Spounce" can flower eagle 
 (U-God) 
 Soul Soul need a taste 
 My right 
 Head in the right place 
 Do what to do like 
 You suppose to be 
 Now give up your change 
 Before the game's on me 
 Now bouce can you dig it? 
 On the real side 
 Stay in the showcase 
 Be satisfied 
 Now meet me at the big house 
 That I tair down 
 Let everybody know 
 That everybody know 
 That I made you squise 
 Da hit your sound 
 Now bounce get up and do nigga's what you can 
 Everybody do what ladie's what you can 
 "Right" 28 fizik 
 Gang don't mean nothing me 
 You can't run high 
 The games on me 
 "Right" can you dig it? 
 (U-God) 
 It's just the vocab 
 Get the gab 
 Like the river they call me 
 "Rhymen" money on the wood 
 Go good right before Just 60 notum 
 Trick ass bitch nigga dimen'ts 
 Put her arm in perfect timen 
 Sweet signs a sin 
 Steady climbin 
 Alway's preferance food on the table 
 On the move 
 Hash flourish 
 Ever since thang prove 
 My stable every move is faital 
 My step gonna survive 
 No jock 
 Talkin' GMC 
 See the C bring it back to me 
 If it's all right with you it's all right with me 
 We could do like men how you wanted it to be 
 That shiny shake that blind makes chamber's like pineapple grape 
 No time to escape 
 Pimps slap your face 
 On the hole is soul in the hole 
 Roll now blow 
 (U-God) 
 Soul Soul need a taste 
 My right 
 Head in the "right" place 
 Do what to do 
 Like you suppose to be 
 Now give up your change 
 Before the game's on me 
 Now bounce can you dig it? 
 On the real side 
 Stay in the showcase be satisfied 
 Now meet me at the big house 
 That I tair down 
 Let everybody know 
 That everybody know 
 That I made you squise 
 Da hit your sound 
 Now bounce get up and do nigga's what you can 
 Everybody do what ladie's what you can 
 "Right" 28 fizik 
 Gang don't mean nothing me 
 You can't run high 
 The games on me 
 "Right" can you dig it?
