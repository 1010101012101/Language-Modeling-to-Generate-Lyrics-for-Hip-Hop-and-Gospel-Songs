It goes late night pickin' up, broke day, choppin up 
 Still tryin' to make that dough, when it's hot as fuck 
 Niggas don't understand the pain'll blow you 
 The money mold you, slow down dunn, lemme show you, 
 Yo, u ever sold crack to your man mother 
 On the back of the block and she coppin for the undercovers 
 U ever tried to hide the pack from your little brother 
 Under the mattresses where the ratchets is 
 Now he's sellin crack and blastin kids 
 U ever called your sister a bitch, based out on the strip 
 Suckin dick to get a hit, jus a little chip 
 Did your eyes ever cry black tears 
 Cause niggas hate u, that you knew for years 
 Did your right-hand man ever shit on u 
 Did your moms house get raided and she did a bid for u 
 U ever got shot up and put in critical, yo, 
 U ever owed a coke man a hundred grams or two 
 Do you know the outcome or wut your dealin' with 
 Serious repercussions, consequences, 
 Judge slams a hammer, a life sentence 
 I'm a real nigga so this I must mention 
 Watch your back 
 Early in the mornin, time to make the donuts 
 I see my fellows niggas, everybody wanna blow up 
 Go get the 40 and the dutches, set it off 
 Cause that's how we left off last night, of course 
 It's a new day but the same ol' shit, werd 
 The D's is out and they lookin' to be served, 
 The pain is hard to adjust to, nobody trust you 
 So fuck it, get on your hustle 
 Police wanna bust you, niggas wanna buck you 
 People that use to love you, now they sayin' fuck you 
 Lord what have I done to deserve all this pain 
 Pumpin nights in rain gettin' off them thangs 
 Taking all money, food stamps, pinky rings 
 And wedding bands, goin' strong hand to hand 
 I look in the mirror and ask the man, he understands 
 Watch your back 
 Yo, watch your back, your next move might be your last 
 Muthafuckers is rotten, they plottin on that ass 
 You fucked up, showed that bitch all your cash 
 U should'ntof did that, might push your wig back 
 Kids get kidnapped, holes in your six pack 
 Recognize what I'm sayin' dunn, 
 Half the hood is dead and the other half laying up, 
 Heads up, eyes and ears open, 
 Coke from head quarters, rest in piece, I'm zoning 
 Shit is real on the front line 
 Dodgin bullets, stiffing, the boss shitted, plus one time 
 They wanna kill a nigga over a lil bread 
 Fall back, call a scally get a lil head 
 'Cause if not, they up on that roof top, 
 Plain clothes, nigga don't get knocked 
 Remember the ten commandments, big pop 
 Ain't gettin' bagged, stay the fuck from police 
 Watch your back
