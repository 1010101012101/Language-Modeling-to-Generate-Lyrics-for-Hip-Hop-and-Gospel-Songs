(Feat. DJ Premier) 
 (Scratched) "You know we gonna ill" 
 What... set it off what 
 My nigga Prim 
 Black Poet 
 Fuck the dumb shit, niggaz want drama 
 You know who to come kid, the cappital P the o-et 
 Smash motherfuckers up, crush motherfuckers up 
 Leave your body in the closet for a motherfucking month 
 Niggaz know my flow's relentless I said it I meant this 
 Niggaz get high, bitches get bent 
 Everybody knows Poet's on some hood shit 
 I wake every thug around the world tryin' to get rich 
 If you're doing your thing then slinging your thing 
 You know and I know nigga better bang 
 Watch them hoes, watch them snakes 
 Real niggaz in the game, fuck who ??? 
 Real niggaz in the game knows what it takes 
 And real niggaz let you know what's real and fake 
 Like my nigga Primo, he reach stile to me yo 
 Whereever he goes, I go, se, he me amigo 
 And we gonna ill 
 (Chorus: scratching by DJ Premier) 
 "You know we gonna ill" (x2) 
 "With love to those who died in the field 
 So many names we don't got room to spit them" 
 "This ain't a game nigga" 
 "You know we gonna ill" (x3) 
 What, what, aha, yeah, yeah 
 I sat back I watch ya niggaz and clacked ya niggaz 
 Played you on my box since I put rocks and figures 
 Got it through this life, drugs chop my shit, nigga 
 Lyrics gotta throw blood kill ya weak niggaz 
 Represent, all thugs and all money getters 
 I live some green and blings and shit that glitters 
 And plus, the word on the street is 
 I hotter then 2 blaze of 9 millimetres 
 You can't believe this 
 A&R's, they pullin out their heads 
 They get fierd 'cause they havd a nigga right there 
 CEO's screaming "why the fuck yu didn't sign 'em?" 
 "He brought in a mansion and a hot boy diamands" 
 Should have gave me the world, stupid fuck 
 Look how I'm rhymin', wildin', calmin', poundin', grindin' 
 I ain't lyin' 
 Mad niggaz try with me, die with me 
 Belive it nigga, you don't wanna have to colide with me 
 We gonna ill 
 Yo, got it together now, Mo' to them now 
 Rest in peace pops, and my moms, I can't let it down 
 Queensbridge representative, style's unlimeted 
 Hot shots, hot rocks, I'm sendin' it 
 Who else you know get flow like Po' 
 For the love of this shit, and not the dough 
 I write my own rhymes 'cause I like this shit to death 
 Niggaz don't got respect, they just writin' the ceques 
 I might sell 10 mill if I learned some stacks 
 And bleach my skin and front like I'm from the projects 
 But all I can be is me, and catch wreck 
 As far as the eye can see, my whole set 
 Screwball gang-stars, comin' in planes and cars 
 Moet bottles with your brains on the ??? at the bar 
 From now on, shit is gettin' more real 
 My niggaz in QB, I'm leaving you to heal 
 'Cause I'm off the wall and I'm Illmaticly ill 
 (Female singer: x2) 
 You know and I know, shit is real 
 Poet and Primo, them niggaz gon' ill 
 The whole industry's about, blacks and feal 
 Poet and Primo, them niggaz gon' ill 
 You know, I know, we gonna ill (x2) 
 We're gonna ill...
