You are now tuned in to the golden state 
 To all my niguhs on the streets and behind closed gates 
 Continue to maintain daily and carry the weight 
 And all my folks on the outside continue to rise 
 Finally released to the rest of the nation, anticipation 
 Was killin' me, my niguh flex said niguhs is feelin' me 
 Larger than life baby with crazy respect 
 You know these alkaholik niguhs guaranteed to get you wet 
 Don't sweat the technique 'cause I was put on the street 
 To delete the weak minded, if you've got beef then grind it 
 Most niggaz is blinded by the glamour and glitz 
 But I don't fuck with that shit 
 Your only dope was your last hit 
 Constantly lit up from the place where we hit 'em 
 In the wrong hair dresser have you leavin' in an ambulance stretcher 
 Xzibit heard a thousand strikes 
 I give a fuck about five mics, and kerosine lights 
 All I need is my royalty checks my ice cold becks 
 So bitch you dig ruff sex with funkmaster flex 
 Bringin' it live from my tape deck from n.y.c 
 To the we.s.t. switch the x to the z 
 You are now tuned in to the golden state 
 To all my niggaz on the streets and behind closed gates 
 Continue to maintain daily and carry the wieght 
 And all my folks on the outside continue to rise
