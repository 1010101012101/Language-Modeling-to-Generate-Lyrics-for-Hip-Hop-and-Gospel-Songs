(G child) (xzibit) 
 That's some good dope 
 Ain't nuttin' like some good dope 
 Yeah, umm hmm 
 That's some good shit, man 
 Woo, spaceketeers 
 Hey, this is the g-child 
 We back big baby 
 Ooh, ah (ahah, ahah) 
 I think I need a fix 
 I think I need a fix, man, uh 
 (Warren g) 
 Warren g, g'd up (uh) 
 Fuck that blaze the weed up 
 Got a problem? best to ease up 
 Ain't no fightin', I raise the heat up 
 Gotcha bitch knees up 
 And by the end of the night, it's beat up 
 You say you eat dicks, then bitch, well, eat it up 
 But bring a few friends that's x-tacy'd up, what 
 (Snoop dogg) 
 Now all I see is we, lbc, 213 
 G's 'n fleezin', the reason, the season 
 The click's off the heezy, mr. warren g-eezy 
 Gots to make it easy for snoop d-eezy 
 To come back and drop raps and make snaps so easy 
 The most haunted, and most wanted 
 With a pocket full of hundreds 
 You know how we run it 
 1- (nate dogg) 
 You can catch the bus if you runnin' (if you runnin') 
 But, oh, no, the game don't wait 
 No, the game don't wait 
 All my homies that next to me hustlin' (hustlin') 
 'Cause they (the game) 
 Know the game don't wait 
 No, the game don't wait (game don't wait) 
 (Xzibit) 
 It ain't nothin' like a one night stand, a night tan 
 And a big chest got me feelin' like a brand new man 
 Roll some doe and nigga gimme somethin' to smoke 
 Say she didn't love the status, she just love the stroke 
 Restless, beat the pussy till she fallin' asleep 
 Athletes trippin' off a couple a thousand a week 
 Just to do the same thang 
 I didn't even know this bitch's name 
 She was in my car givin' me brain 
 (Warren g) 
 X to the z pass the m-i-c 
 Anticipation 213 (ah) 
 We contimplate (ah ha) 
 And regulate (what) 
 Now we got the game tight 
 It's money ta make (money, money) 
 The game won't wait but you can wait for the game 
 Worldwide tour, with skirts screamin' our name 
 (G-child) (nate dogg) 
 Ya know I can kinda dig that 
 Because the game don't wait on anybody 
 Ya know, I need a fix (game don't wait) 
 (Nate dogg) 
 Shit don't stop because the game don't wait 
 I got no time for no damn lunch break 
 I got to go out and buy some brand new clothes 
 And change my socks 'fore they reveal my toes 
 Shit don't stop because the game don't wait 
 The hookers flock because the dick is straight 
 Let me teach you what I already know 
 The shit don't stop, so it's time I go (game don't wait) 
 (Snoop dogg) 
 Youngsta never bite the hand that's feeds you 
 Proceed to give back to your folks and loccs that need you 
 We do, we always keep it on the true 
 213, that's the name of the crew 
 It's true, that the dirt I did as a kid got me _caught up_ 
 But I was brought up with the m-o if a d-o 
 So for your info, nigga 
 I been doin' this before I hit the radizzo 
 Snoop d-eezy is off the heezey 
 So you can make mine, extra cheesy 
 The crew's a twist 'cause it consists of 
 Three riders, eastsidaz, one love 
 Repeat 1
