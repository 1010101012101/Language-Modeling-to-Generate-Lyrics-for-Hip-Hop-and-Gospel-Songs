Intro: Xzibit, (J-Ro) 
 I really wish I could you know at twenty-one 
 YouknowhatI'msayin', he he, yo yo 
 (I'ma tell you exactly why I do the things 
 I do, youknowhatI'm sayin') 
 Gotta carry the weight youknowhatI'msayin' 
 Go ahead 
 Yeah! I break it down like this 
 Verse One: 
 You see I don't like to remenisce about the past 
 The lower class, no clout livin' hand to mouth 
 Each and every wrong move the police keep count 
 Make it real fuckin' easy to get streched out 
 I was at the funeral when it all began 
 You know the painful transition from a boy to men 
 I lost sight of my mother at the age of nine 
 Didn't understand death nearly lost my mind 
 But see life moves on and broke niggas can't change it 
 Age ten, new step family arrangement 
 At thirteen, I started gettin' hair on my dick 
 And noticed me and my sister were gettin' treated like shit 
 I would forever be hit with anything in reach 
 Then my father would proceed to go to church and preach 
 About forgiveness, patience all the shit that he lacked 
 Gettin' jump when he said and the head gat cracked 
 Physical contact was in form of a slap 
 At the age of fifteen Xzibit now hit back 
 Courtesy of my stepbrother, who taught me to scrap 
 Left the bitch on the ground with her eyes on black 
 Ran away from the house of Teresa and Nate 
 Into juvenile detention where I built up hate 
 I don't remember the date of the judicial debate 
 But legally I was now in custody of the state 
 And niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink 
 Say what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak 
 I'm trying to contemplate the next move to make 
 Gotta find some way to release this hate 
 And niggas wonder why I sit up in the club and drink 
 Say what's up to Xzibit and I still don't speak 
 I'm trying to contemplate the next move to make 
 Gotta find some way Xzibit carry the weight 
 Interlude: Xzibit, (J-Ro) 
 (Yeah it's fucked up though man) 
 (YouknowhatI'msayin') 
 Yo 
 (The fuck you doin' in jail) 
 Insane man, I don't know man, he he he 
 (Yeah wats goin' on down there, gotta get out dude) 
 Yeah I be out in couple of weeks man 
 YouknowI'msayin' 
 (It's popin' man) 
 It's cool yo fuck that 
 (It's popin' out here) 
 They can go on and on for that 
 (I'm tellin' you it's popin' man come home) 
 Verse Two: 
 And that was worse then the treatment I was gettin' at home 
 But only now I was fucked up plus all alone 
 My father talkin' all crazy to me over the phone 
 Turned age sixteen now on my own 
 Started running with cats who carried gats 'cause they had too 
 With no hesitation lock load then blast you 
 Without a hastle we in a town of hicks 
 Fuckin' all these chicks 
 Sellin' rock by the bricks 
 So we feelin' like we mothafuckin' Nino Brown 
 At the house when the mothafuckin' man touched down 
 Screamin' demands "Let me see your goddamn hands (now)" 
 A.T.F. cause of handguns and contraban 
 We never kept it in the house 
 So of course we clounded 
 Only found one pistol took us all down town 
 We be out by the end of the afternoon 
 Gettin' drunk on the strip let the system BOOM! 
 Who would assume Mr. QK would chill with a wife 
 Ty and Matt caught bodies 
 Now they spend there life behind bars 
 Catchin' scars that will not heal 
 Niggas don't know the half about keepin' it real 
 Like this 
 Like this, like that 
 Yeah! gotta carry the weight 
 Like this euh! 
 Bringin' live 
 Yeah! yeah! like this 
 It's Xzibit 
 Gotta carry the weight 
 Like that yo! 
 Like that yo!
