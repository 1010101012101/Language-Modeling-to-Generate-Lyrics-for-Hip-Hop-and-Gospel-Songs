-Rza intro from "airwaves"- 
 (King tech) 
 One two, one two 
 We dedicate this one to the hip-hop culture y'all 
 Brought to you by the wooorrrlld famous wake up show 
 (Rza) 
 Bobby steels, staple' tails, MC's get your lips stapled 
 Project killa hill is stamped on the map like the compass 
 Sacred sword play tongue twist piercin holes in you 
 You can't escape seventy-thousand kilowatts blast through yo' box 
 Walk wit alarm clocks, cars drivin' slow down the block 
 One stopped, parks, pops his trunk 
 Snare pops loud as glock shots 
 Bass like an m-80 in ya face, cops stop, give us citation 
 We pause for radio station identification 
 Wake up wake up wake up! (tech is on) 
 (Tech n9ne) 
 When I woke up, I grabbed the mic and never choked up 
 Busted a verse and all the g's in cali loc'ed up when I was summoned 
 Styles were mixed like the drummonds 
 Killer clown is comin' lookin' around your town is crumblin 
 This big tech from the midwest, leavin' MC's litless 
 On the wake up show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow 
 Put me off in a cypher? potna, you can't *fuck* wit the snyper 
 Your flow's premature, clean your dirty diaper 
 Mic heister, psycho alpha-schizo 
 Hypno, chryo gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter 
 Sway and tech heard me flow and it's sealed 
 Now I got Swedish women yellin' "tech n9ne svelte!" 
 (Eminem) 
 This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit white out 
 'Cause y'all can't see me like mase's eyebrows (where you at?) 
 Climbed out of a nice house 
 Through the front window and heard this guy shout 
 "Hey that's my couch! (bitch!)" 
 Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout 
 While I'm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds 
 And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flippin verticle 
 Nose-first wit the top off landin up-side down 
 You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape 
 I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved 
 And sway and tech, two disk jockeys 
 Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject 
 (Xzibit) 
 Lo and behold, better than platinum and gold 
 Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul 
 Xzibit take control, lock loaded and ready to roll 
 Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold 
 'Cause your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up 
 Or listen to my niggas tech and sway so you can wake up 
 The x-man, catch me doin' drills in the danger room 
 Big game huntin from high noon till the full moon 
 (Pharoahe monch) 
 Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush 
 From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims 
 As horrid as boris korloff was 
 When I cut ya neck, leave a little piece of skin so the head won't fall off 
 Hauled-off, sawed off shotgun blast 
 He asked, why did he have to die like cast metal? 
 O, huh, c now like omar credle 
 We pone pedal at a high resolution 
 On the wake up show wit sway, tech and DJ revolution 
 *DJ revolution scratches* 
 (Kool g rap) 
 I sway the tec wit the tech and sway 
 Step away, wet and spray, rep the day 
 Who over debt to pay get swept away 
 Across the whole board like checker play 
 When I blaze your whole sect' arrays 
 Wake up show for those who slept away 
 Niggas that met the trey, hit the deck and pray 
 DJ revolution, spinnin like lead from out the head decay 
 Tearin your neck away, flood up the street wit blood redecorate 
 Until the head of jake investigate 
 (Jayo felony) 
 What, sway can give it to but whatcha gon' do wit it 
 Tech can give it to you but whatcha gon' do? 
 Rev can give it to you but whatcha gon' do wit it 
 I can give it to you, wha wha wha what what! 
 (Chino xl) 
 Yo yo, chino make the world go 'round 
 Fuckin' up entire record companies like harrell did to motown 
 Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk 
 Which flow will I destroy you wit this time, the most commonest thought 
 The drama that's brought, caught us in the midst of a sibling rivalry 
 For instance, there is nothing born in existence that can survive wit me 
 Clone me like sheep, I clean house like tony randall 
 My style foul/file, for sexual harassment like tisha campbell 
 You wack like will smith, your rhyme style is pansy 
 I fuckin' murder your young style like jon benet ramsey 
 Now who the master to beg, your demo get passed on the reg' 
 You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg 
 I'm wake up show reppin, wit sway and tech 
 My tec's like tekken, the industry weapon 
 I'm chino x, bring krs in 
 (Krs-one) 
 De de de da de de de da di day hey! krs-one comin' wit the tech and sway 
 Yo, I rock up on the littlest set and up on the biggest set 
 As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat 
 Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt 
 You gotta be, willin' to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet 
 But I'm willin' to bet, on a sway and a tech 
 They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin respect 
 Nevertheless I wreck you, now you know what sway and tech do 
 I'll be back but for now just sackle! 
 Ha ha ha, fresh for 1999 you suckas!
