 (A.g.) 
 Check it out now 
 I work the angles like, off the cushion in the sidepocket 
 Electrifying like a live socket 
 Hit 'em with all flavors, yup 
 We tryin' to be neighbords with pro-ballplayers, I'm talkin' papers 
 Or keep it realer, and see me on a iron caterpillar 
 On point like a killer, plus ready, to deliver 
 Type gifted, treat the mic right, or I might rip it 
 Critics dig my style 'cause I write different, no hype 
 I just kick it, low-lifes, they wanna get it 
 I shine like the ice when I hold mics, every time 
 Got every dime, sayin' this nigga so nice, you know what? 
 They so right, you get stuck, I'll go twice 
 Lit it up when I blow mics 
 (Evidence) 
 Show mic precise, require sacrifice 
 That's no hassle, the master got more loops than lassos 
 Y'all hear me? they all conspiracy theories 
 Worthless, like testing ev' defeats the purpose 
 Since the beginning, intrigued by pot and attentive women 
 Breakbeats and windmills on concrete 
 Covered by cardboard, seafloor to skyline 
 Bottom line, in rhyme yo, put in time you shine 
 That's right sometimes I get so hyped 
 I feel like diamond d the best producer on the mic 
 I aced this -- most punchlines are tasteless 
 Regular, average, mediocre, makeshift 
 To all my DJ's, with skills you got a lotta 
 This ain't on your mixtape, yo it coulda been hotta 
 The method in this game they'll have you drained and strangles 
 Don't go to them, let 'em come to you, and work the angles 
 (Defari) 
 Don't sleep on, I leave your knee torn, like sehorn 
 Liquid MC storm, like children of the corn, a wild freeform 
 Of energy, mentally fit to last a century 
 Like centuries, one double-zero translate to victories 
 You kiddin me me? come wack that's not my history 
 Kidnap the wack and break his ankles, remember +misery+? 
 Lyrically you're skatin out of control 
 Work the angles 'round the globe, from newark to south pole 
 It's so cold that MC's catch pneumonia 
 I'm airborne, from l.a. to barcelona 
 I rock heads from pomona out the bronx 
 Drop the sure needle contact, now watch me launch 
 DJ's, you jugglin, that means I'm bubblin 
 Defari on the remix fix, this shit is thunderin 
 Picture me fumblin or droppin' the ball 
 That's like picturin guy without that nigga aaron hall 
 (Iriscience) 
 Well if a brother gets the best of me 
 Ain't no use in sniveling and blaming the referee 
 Fuck that, I strip the mic with tenacous d 
 Kick it up to evidence, yo kick it out to me! 
 Line up the three, trifecta stroked properly 
 Rocca, I work the angles triple opticly 
 The hip-hop multi-beat real monopoly 
 My g is god, what's your g for, geometry? 
 This man of war beats cold on the seashore 
 An deeo enough to take it to the sea floor 
 Every single beat bangs like a c-4 
 We drop beats, why you asking what the beat for? 
 The spitfire fighter dilated entity 
 I'm learning shockers like shockra building energy 
 While barbershops sipping henny like the kennedy's 
 I'm always been independent, that's word to beni b 
 It's guaranteed 
 (Xzibit) 
 Make t-shirts and slingshots, I bust khakis out, bounce to the weed spot 
 Naturally, me and my faculty never play with this 
 I used to love h.e.r. too, but now I fucking hate the bitch 
 She's sucking up to all the niggas with the chains and whips 
 But that's all right, because all she do for me is pay the rent 
 And keep it moving, got a bad habit of losing my cool 
 Acting a fool, breaking out tools, and making the whole corwd move 
 Towards the exit, this be the next shit, we got you dilated 
 Hotter than Satan, the repeated parole violations 
 Xzibit work the angles, cordless to dirty angels 
 How the west was won: with microphones and turntables
