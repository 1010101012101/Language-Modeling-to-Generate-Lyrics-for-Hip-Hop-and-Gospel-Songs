First night I spent in California 
 I was homeless in a Venice beach 
 It was all a dream 
 Came to California at seventeen 
 Little nigga tryna bubble up from the crack scene 
 It got so complicated, then I graduated 
 Haters so mad I made it 
 How could I fly so high only to feel so low 
 How do they live so fast only to grow so slow 
 Like when you short no support for your kids 
 But got money for marijauna just to smoke with your friends 
 Or that woman who survives and beats cancer 
 Only to be drowned in debt with no answers 
 The frequency of tragedy it happens so rapidly 
 That we became numb, we embraced this insanity 
 Some wack job hauled off and smoke his whole family 
 Reality TV that's not based in reality 
 Stuck watching train wrecks everybody going for self 
 Self worth prison point but for money and wealth 
 This mentality of me, fuck everything else 
 It's a virus, a disease I'm a victim myself 
 But I swear before I leave I?ma fix it I swear 
 I?ma fix it I swear 
 Yo you better beware 
 Rich boy kill his own wife knocks her teeth out 
 Cuts her fingers off than escape with a suicide 
 The king of pop died, Michael Vick was fighting dogs 
 But he walked and did his time let him throw the fucking ball 
 As the markers keep crashing and people get desperate 
 Putting faith in the false feeling so disrespected 
 Turn to this record the highest form of understanding 
 Understand me, fight a flight for your family (come) 
 Walk with a soldier (come) 
 Talk with a soldier 
 Centerblocks stop shooting straight from the shoulder 
 As we all get older and hope falls over 
 And damn you was 6 years sober 
 And just like that now you back were you started square one 
 And you can't bring it back when that bullet leave the gun 
 As the planet get smaller, prepare for the North American Union 
 An anvil to replace your dollars 
 Narcisistic society love paparazzi 
 Get the starbucks for your overpriced latte 
 Ignoring all the signs, nevermind is your mindstate 
 Until the end of time, shit is closer than you think man. 
 Trick Trick: 
 I've done been in situations where the only thing that I can do is read the Bible 
 Went to the [?] where a piece of metal the only way of survival 
 Made up my mind that I don't ever want to return 
 Chance was given again now I'm back out in the World 
 Made a promise to God but living in sin 
 I can never lie to God but it's so hard to live right 
 I'm carrying 7 point 62's to fist fights 
 Ain't nobody playing fair they cheat no cheat 
 Way finna be the topic for the preachers Eulogy speaking 
 The word say "turn the other cheek" that's what they teach us 
 But Peter sliced the ear off a nigga rollin' on Jesus 
 I don't wanna pause I'm doing what I'm supposed to do 
 I'm a real nigga one from a million chosen few 
 Everlasting pain has got my brain like its trapped inside a maze 
 Have you been unfaithful to the game (damn shame) 
 18 years you never believed him that's yo son 
 Go and see him muthafucker 
 You fucked his mother 
 The God Damn common courtesy never applied to you 
 Cause you thought she lied to you 
 You couldn't see your own mother in his face 
 If you die he'll be in a better place 
 Bring the tape back
