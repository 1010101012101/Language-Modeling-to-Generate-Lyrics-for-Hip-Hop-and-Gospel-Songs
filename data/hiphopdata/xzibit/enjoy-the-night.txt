We gon' get fucked up, enjoy the night, enjoy the night 
 We gon' get fucked up and that's alright, that's alright 
 Raised in the gutter, I'm a find a way, everything is okay 
 Baby, lift your cup up, enjoy the night, enjoy the night 
 Amsterdam to Tokyo, longitude only I can know 
 Latitude is my attitude fall in place like a domino 
 I ain't come here to make no friends 
 'Cause I rather be feared than love 
 Scared to death that I move this mountain 
 Get to you with this shotgun slum 
 And I could never turn my back on the ways of life 
 I'm sparing no expense top down Vegas lights 
 My flows they verge in tide I do not give a fuck 
 It's about to jump tonight my crib is filling up 
 Is filling up, is filling up full of bitches I have never met 
 And they ain't left like these bitches here on house arrest 
 Line out two shots and I'm down six darker light but that shit 
 Don't mix, got a body bag full of pills and shit let's see 
 How fucked up we all gon' get 
 We gon' get fucked up, enjoy the night, enjoy the night 
 We gon' get fucked up and that's alright, that's alright 
 Raised in the gutter, I'm a find a way, everything is okay 
 Baby, lift your cup up, enjoy the night, enjoy the night 
 Raised in the gutter bread getting butter 
 Face like her mother ass like she's southern 
 So much cash I just gotta laugh 
 Out in Paris smoking grass signing autographs 
 It's apparent if it's foreign and I'm starring 
 If it's shining then I'm near it, it's designer then I wear it, uh 
 Look at these diamonds spend some time on my appearance 
 You too busy saving hoes you ain't gonna find a dime on clearance 
 You know me bitch I get straight down to the point 
 Pop another bottle roll another joint 
 And all of my niggas OG's and all of that smoke is OG 
 I'm way too high to be low key, better act like you know me 
 We gon' get fucked up, enjoy the night, enjoy the night 
 We gon' get fucked up and that's alright, that's alright 
 Raised in the gutter, I'm a find a way, everything is okay 
 Baby, lift your cup up, enjoy the night, enjoy the night 
 Girl, if you wanna get some drunk 
 Then cutie it, come and get it from me 
 I know I shouldn't mix all this vodka with this Hennessy 
 But we gon' get fucked up, then pour it up 
 Drink beer, party like there's not a night 
 Put a one night before that bitch 
 We don't sleep until we get sick 
 We gon' blaze till we get licked, call Earl 
 The world spinning, talking jail, we winning 
 The girl that you love is good in the beginning 
 Two good shots and not a girl singing 
 Spinning over now I'm sober face breasts more murr 
 Line out two shots and I'm down six darker light 
 But that shit don't mix, got a body bag full of pills 
 And shit let's see how fucked up we all gon' get 
 We gon' get fucked up, enjoy the night, enjoy the night 
 We gon' get fucked up and that's alright, that's alright 
 Raised in the gutter, I'm a find a way, everything is okay 
 Baby, lift your cup up, enjoy the night, enjoy the night
