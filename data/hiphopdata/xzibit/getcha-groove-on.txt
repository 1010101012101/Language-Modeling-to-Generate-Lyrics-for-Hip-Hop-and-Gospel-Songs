(Xzibit) 
 Yes 
 Millennium shit 
 Limp bizkit, ha, x to the z 
 Yeah, ha 
 Bringin' it live to you and yours 
 Ladies and gentlemen, ha, ha, ha 
 My homeboy, yo get at 'em dog 
 Hook: fred durst 
 You don't wanna fuck with, me today 
 'Cause a little somethin', somethin' didn't, go your way 
 So try not to be like, that today 
 'Cause I'm a real motherfucker from 'round the way 
 We don't give a fuck when we're rockin' the place 
 We're only givin' a fuck if you're invadin the space 
 So getcha, getcha groove on (gotta getcha groove on) 
 Don't keep us waitin too long (don't keep us waitin too long) 
 (Fred durst) 
 Don't you treat me like a toy kid 
 Do you enjoy this 
 Every single second I'm alive I'm a mess 
 Got these laser beam mic checks 
 Communicatin through the genelect 
 High tech, keep you on the run now 
 Don't wanna be that, guy 
 Every single second I'm alive, I'm, alive 
 I, don't understand why 
 I got control, full of candy in your soul while 
 Pumpin up the sweetness 
 This is what you need 
 Another little piece of me inside of you 
 'Cause you know that I always keep it true (keep it true) 
 And that's exactly why I do just what I do 
 Yeah, it's what I do 
 (Xzibit) 
 I got breakneck delivery, no time for chivalry 
 Extraordinary ability, shit longevity 
 Dig deep in your soul and find yourself 
 'Cause mind control can turn y'all to someone else 
 So fast, your head'll probably spin the fuck right off 
 Me and fred about to go half on microsoft 
 Me and limp burnin twenty percent 
 Your little half ass direct hits ain't even makin' a dent 
 What an event, all hell xzibit and limp 
 As we attempt to bring home the championship 
 It's all in the wrists I still leave the league an assist 
 Gimme the fifth, I'm drinking while I'm takin' a piss, bitch 
 (Xzibit) 
 I got untapped material, I serial kill shit 
 Gimme the real shit, x finish 'em all quick 
 Makin' your jaw split when I'm touchin the mosh pit 
 Constant conflict, knockin' faggots unconscious 
 Nauseous, raisin the stakes, increasin the weight 
 Got homies I can lay down that lift they plates 
 So quit trying to invade my space 
 Before I call for a face to face, and gotta rest my case like... 
 (Durst) 
 This is how we do it 
 Just recognize we keep gettin' right to it 
 Lookin' through these eyes, look into these eyes 
 And you'll see the size of the flame 
 Then you might despise the size of my game 
 Step the fuck back, xzibit's on the track 
 You should've buckled up before your head hit the dash 
 You gotta hate that, a demo from an eight track 
 Brought me to a place, where platinum comes in eight stacks, bitch 
 Hook to end 
 (Xzibit over hook) 
 Limp bizkit ladies and gentlemen 
 C'mon! yeah! 
 Takin' this shit over for motherfucking 2000, 2001
