Man in not a touch with the regular 
 My brain waves on the same page as a cellulars 
 I see in hi-D resolution a five g 
 Revolution with plans and solutions 
 Check the stations, same conversations 
 That's old formats leave 'em at the door mat 
 Wave files, avi and mp3's 
 The day is the same as a child learning his ABC's 
 It's the way of the world goodbye CD's and DVDS 
 Its 3D inside TV screens 
 So now I can do anything 
 Without the kinda luck that a penny brings 
 Uploaded my music it happened so quickly 
 Now they at the show singing right along with me 
 The future is there, I take you there 
 But you gon have to catch me, come and get me 
 I'm takin' off, takin' off, takin' off 
 I'm outta here outta here I'm gone 
 You can catch me if you can but I'm goneeee I'm gone 
 We outta here 
 We outta here 
 Weightless, I can see the continents 
 Rollin' in my space ghost, Rolls-Royce rocket ships 
 I'm bringing back intelligence from space from the heavens that will take us up into a higher place 
 Prepare for the equinox infinite possibilities 
 Eating with the astronauts 
 Yeah 
 I hide my secrets in the sun 
 That way nobody ever looks directly into the way I was 
 Its only what I have become 
 Not a public enemy but still my oozy ways a ton 
 My millennium falcon is flawless 
 I walk light years away from these typical artists 
 Heartless I ain't got no soul 
 I just devour everything with them I reach like a black hole 
 I'm in your city like a titty full of silicone 
 Get off that old shit mack black is killin' crome 
 I'm takin' off, takin' off, takin' off 
 I'm outta here outta here I'm gone 
 You can catch me if you can but I'm goneee, I'm gone 
 We outta here 
 We outta here
