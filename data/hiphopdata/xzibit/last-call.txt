(All) 
 Last call for alcohol 
 The club is almost closed 
 (That's right) 
 So I need your name and your number 
 (Yo, yo) 
 Before the night is through 
 (Tash) 
 Y'all wanna talk about drinking? 
 I took a drink, took a swallow 
 Left the champagne bottle hollow 
 Passed my keys to lil' talo 
 Can't crash the el dorado 
 You know how it go 
 When you sipping on mo' 
 You be tore up from the floor up 
 And you don't even know 
 (Xzibit) 
 I had the bartender set up three shots 
 I knocked 'em back 
 Nitrate over the track 
 The whole crowd reacted 
 From right here through the ? ? 
 Baby relax you're rolling with me 
 It's mister a through x to the z 
 (Sfp) 
 Going out with my friends 
 To celebrate the weekend 
 I hope the club is jumping 
 So I can find a little something 
 Wanna get my drink on 
 Wanna get my freak on 
 I'm gonna try to come on 
 Before the night is over

 Custom fitted whatever you want 
 From the car straight to the bar 
 We're the la guns holding hennesy for everyone
