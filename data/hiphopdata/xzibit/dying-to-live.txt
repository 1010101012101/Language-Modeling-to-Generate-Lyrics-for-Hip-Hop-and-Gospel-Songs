Break the bank, 
 Make my heart rate escalate 
 I can't wait till the sun come up 
 Come precise, like a diamond cut 
 I live life like my time is up 
 So I ain't got no time to waste 
 Don't want a watch with a diamond face 
 I wanna watch through a scope 
 Head shot from a mile away 
 Ya head pop like JFK, 
 Like a plot by the CIA, 
 We ain't dying from the KKK, 
 When that AK spray, They say "ay bay bay", 
 Stay tuned, watch the melee play, 
 Get attached to the tracks and the facts through the words I say 
 Gotta navigate out my way, 
 I'm a roadside IED, 
 Detonating on live TV, 
 Larry King, all eyes on me 
 Now put your hands where my eyes can see 
 If I die 
 Before I wake 
 I pray the Lord 
 My soul to take 
 'Cause I have faith 
 And I can't wait 
 To get these obstacles up outta my face 
 'Cause it's my time 
 And it's my grind 
 And not even midnight can stop my shine 
 Let me confront 
 The ultimate sin 
 You're ready to die 
 But I'm dying to live 
 The hustler's theme 
 Caught in between greed and the best of things 
 I don't even breathe, expand my chest fatigued 
 Benjamin green leaves in a nest of thieves 
 I get down on my knees and beg God to forgive my sins, 
 Back at it again, raise up like Attica did 
 Shift down 4th to 5th and burn like an arsonist, 
 Westbound down PCH catching nothing but green lights, 
 My foot never touched the brakes, 
 Maloof Money makes moves in Vegas 
 Shake Cali like the San Andreas, 
 I'm the truth in the booth, you a space invader 
 Go 'head and hate me, hater 
 Hack ya hard drive and erase the data 
 Till I come face to face with my creator 
 Bust back, bottom line, Bourne Ultimatum 
 I'm too smart to assassinate him 
 Try and touch me, it's fine, I'll just kindly return the favor 
 I return the emancipator, 
 May we all progress, 
 To the power of X 
 If I die 
 Before I wake 
 I pray the Lord 
 My soul to take 
 'Cause I have faith 
 And I can't wait 
 To get these obstacles up outta my face 
 'Cause it's my time 
 And it's my grind 
 Not even midnight can stop my shine 
 Let me confront 
 The ultimate sin 
 You're ready to die 
 But I'm dying to live 
 What you know about mass appeal? 
 I peel out as I clutch the wheel 
 Death certificate, signed and sealed 
 Take a journey down the road to glory, 
 Pay attention to a soldier's story: 
 There will be none after there was none before me, 
 X-Man withstand the test, 
 A thin line between life and death, 
 Sometimes it sucks When you find success, 
 Lost friends never lost respect, 
 Coming home like an Iraq vet, 
 So now the time and the place is set, 
 It's been a long haul, ready to go, circle up, C'mon, start the show 
 So I can breath and achieve the impossible 
 I want the bootleggers To get it, 
 The wise words of Xzibit 
 You never seen me crash and burn 
 I'm dying to live it 
 Who ready For a revolution? 
 Who ready For a real solution? 
 Save the music 
 If I die 
 Before I wake 
 I pray the Lord 
 My soul to take 
 'Cause I have faith 
 And I can't wait 
 To get these obstacles up outta my face 
 'Cause it's my time 
 And it's my grind 
 Not even midnight can stop my shine 
 Let me confront 
 The ultimate sin 
 You're ready to die 
 But I'm dying to live, 
 I'm dying to live...
