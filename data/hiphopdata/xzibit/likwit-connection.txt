"But it's a herut-likwit crew connection"(sample) 2x 
 (Defari) 
 Don't regret it, you had your chance and couldn't set it 
 You hear me rhyme and try to shine on my time, forget it 
 Hear me on radio, live vocally do edits 
 E-swift scratchin and threading, with supreme unleaded 
 Only the best out the likwit crew out the west 
 And we shine time after time writting lyri-gets 
 On freshly buffed and waxed marble steps 
 Defari got a style that's iller than tourrettes 
 Make you switch, make a bitch get undressed 
 Make people in the club wanna dance chest to chest 
 Bruised falcon, strive for perfection like malcolm 
 Back the name wit potential, but now they know the outcome 
 So now the ticket's weakened, I stay away from tricks 
 Defari, phil da agony, xzibit, and tha liks 
 "The world's" "but it's a herut-likwit crew connection" 
 (Phil da agony) 
 Yo, talk a big game, play a big game 
 You know my motherfuckin name 
 Phil da agony, it's all the same same 
 Game tight, crescent heights, get the name right 
 I do seven songs in the same night 
 Work ethic, proper etiquette, the better shit 
 I want my gold plaque for this shit 
 Soon as the stores get it (you get it) 
 Focused daily, likwit activity 
 Phil da agony causing you total tragedy 
 (Xzibit) 
 My chest is burning from the hennesy rock 
 Yo I live to see the enemy drop 
 The safety night got kennedy shot 
 It's political, the way I smash down is pitiful 
 Situation critical, barely breathin in a hospital 
 Dead meat, we give it like professional athletes 
 The elite wit a chick for everyday of the week 
 I'm talking Monday through Sunday 
 Models walkin' up and down the runway 
 I take a lethal role in the gunplay 
 To finish wit flyin colors, tha alkaholik brothers 
 Connected, respect it, ain't no choice but to love us 
 It's not, east to west, I want the whole world behind me 
 I got niggas in l.a. sayin' "fuck guiliani" 
 (Tash) 
 I'm hella-cocky on the mic, I fuck it up on jeep beats 
 So while you rockin' to this beat, the beat is rockin' to me 
 Foul-mouth catashtrophe, I knock heads since '93 
 So when you come across my style, it's like you smacked into a tree 
 I turn the heat up in this bitch, I make the women strip fast 
 So no matter what you do you can't fuck wit big tash 
 I came to kick your ass, quick fast, not to house you 
 I want your homies saying "tash smacked the shit out you" 
 Smoke something, drink something, eat lyrics that twist 
 This that shit that's on your baby momma's christmas list 
 ? So balls? amount to this, no matter what y'all niggas name is 
 You're not as famous, as the likwit entertainers 
 "The world's famous" but it's a herut-likwit crew connection (2x) 
 (J-ro) 
 It's the likwit coalition, start the mission 
 We gonna turn this into a tradition 
 My b-boy stance is updated, I feel like we made it 
 Even though we underrated 
 Yo, it's to the ro, act a fool over flow 
 I got the uncanny ability to cold rock a show 
 I got fired from my job 'cause I was late to my shift 
 'Cause I was drinkin' a fifth, wit john jingle heimer smith 
 And here's another caper from the lyric landscaper 
 I write flows wit two by fo's wit sand paper 
 Now what is a MC if he can't flow 
 Up next is e-swift and my name is j-ro 
 (E-swift) 
 We don't give a fuck if you down wit such and such 
 You can still get touched, by the likwit bumrush 
 Better train hard before you face me 
 You better off fightin royce gracey 
 To get me out that ass you gotta mace me 
 I make mcs wanna tap out, before I blow they back out 
 Likwit niggas winnin' every bout 
 Rippin mcs like cheap jeans 
 Fuck your DJ and your mainstream production team 
 And if you sleepin' on us, then sweet dreams 
 'Cause when you ain't lookin' we be bookin mad shows makin' cream 
 My profession is killin' studio sessions wit no question (what's that) 
 It's the likwit crew connection 
 "The world's famous" "but it's a herut-likwit crew connection" (7x)
