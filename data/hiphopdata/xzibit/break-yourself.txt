(Xzibit) 
 Last but not least we off the leash 
 The Art of War, reach for your masterpiece 
 Feel the release from the phantom bangs you 
 Snatched off put you in a frame and hang you 
 Comin' at you niggas from a different angle 
 Arch angel choke hold and strangled 
 Kay slay the game turn the tables 
 Get cables, I'm Kane, you Abel 
 Start bullshit, conflicts, labels 
 Manhandle, murder, mangle 
 Life support cut short we hold court 
 In the street make a nigga sleep six feet deep 
 Fuck piece bareback doggystyle 
 Cement ya feet and hold ya down 
 Throw you off the bridge and watch you drown 
 Last one to laugh, it's over now 
 We'll trade ya six and pancake ya loan 
 Break ya bitch and take ya doe 
 Shake ya crys and take it whoa 
 Layin' down the whole dance floor 
 (Break yourself right now) 
 Open bar free drinks this round 
 Walkin' the west, possin' the south 
 Coke can put these in ya mouth 
 Hands up jack the whole crowd 
 (Break yourself right now) 
 (Xzibit) 
 Break crash from ya ass so don't rush to bust 
 Bitches die, cry, and lust for us 
 Damn it feel good to be platinum plus 
 Don't fuck wit us 'cause we dangerous 
 Hold fans like fiends on angel dust 
 Clean get aways, I get out the cuffs 
 Coast like a sailor you fuckin' fucks 
 I done hand it hard to keep in touch 
 Don't pop the crys I pop the clutch 
 Pop one to ya mouth 'cause you talk too much 
 Way in over ya head you get played 
 Left holdin' the bag like John Forte 
 Built for this all work no play here to stay 
 The rest get blown away 
 Built for this all work no play here to stay 
 The rest get blown away 
 C'mon 
 We'll trade ya six and pancake ya loan 
 Break ya bitch and take ya doe 
 Shake ya crys and take it whoa 
 Layin' down the whole dance floor 
 (Break yourself right now) 
 Open bar free drinks this round 
 Walkin' the west, possin' the south 
 Coke can put these in ya mouth 
 Hands up jack the whole crowd 
 (Break yourself right now)

 Neva seen, heard, felt befo' 
 Wanna rumble wit us, just start the show 
 Fill up the chamber let me go 
 Out of town before the shells hit the floor 
 Duck tape ski mask professional 
 Fuck y'all, y'all homosexual 
 Hangin' on my dick like testicle 
 Pop you disappear, "where'd he go?" 
 Pop up some where in Mexico 
 Rotate relate respect the flow 
 Hospital bed you vegetable 
 Can't walk can't talk lettin' you know 
 We hit the hardest, ask ya ho, at my show 
 Seen her in the front row 
 To the back stage in there she blow 
 There she blew 
 Then send her back to you (hello) 
 We'll trade ya six and pancake ya loan 
 Break ya bitch and take ya doe 
 Shake ya crys and take it whoa 
 Layin' down the whole dance floor 
 (Break yourself right now) 
 Open bar free drinks this round 
 Walkin' the west, possin' the south 
 Coke can put these in ya mouth 
 Hands up jack the whole crowd
