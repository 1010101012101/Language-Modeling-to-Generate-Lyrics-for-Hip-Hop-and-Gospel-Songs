Verse one: xzibit 
 (See look look) 
 I grab the mic and start breakin down niggas 
 Wit out no problem 
 Broadcastin live from the bottom/ain't no mic checkin' worse 
 Kick some rhymes if you got/but if it's wack 
 I draw back the cap for the peelin 
 Should of stuck to rock dealin' 
 'Cause it's the blood stealin/super vill... 
 Chill... stayin high like the ceilin 
 See there ain't enough room for the both of us 
 See it's a showdown/throw down 
 Your best style I'll bust 
 (Yo) I write rhymes that make niggas throw they sets up 
 Couldn't hold my style if you had a pair of handcuffs 
 In all disrespect 
 I'll snatch you by your neck 
 And do a suplex and step 
 So nigga you can check my credentials 
 Just hard rhymes and instrumentals 
 Xzhibit smash you wit a dental 
 And a loaded pistol 
 No longer lookin' in the window 
 I'll bust a field wit indo 
 Killin' quarts of beer 
 Sadie's outta here... 
 Verse two: MC breeze 
 Like a fuze/start spreadin the news 
 Its 94 and breeze is givin' niggas the blues 
 I paid my dues/and now it's time to go on to the next mode 
 Make room for the kaboom/'cause I'm about to explode 
 And drop bombs like a b1/cops I seize none 
 And niggas step up/i soak emcseason 
 3 seconds to detinate/you betta evacuate 
 No time to hesitate/you fuckin' featherweight 
 I ain't the type to pic up the mic 
 And catch the stage fright 
 I'll pull a gauge if I ain't paid right 
 To the promoters on tour 
 Short me a buck and a buckshot and the barrel is yours! 
 I'm psycho pathic like manson 
 Ain't wit the dancin 
 But still I get more cheers than ted danson 
 More dough than marino or roles than pacino 
 You beatin' me? that's only in your dreams ho 
 I'm not sayin' I'm unbeatable/I'm sayin' I'm untouchable 
 Livin' comfortable just like a huxtable 
 Plus I'm rollin' wit the cross roads 
 Movin fast forward/while you other suckas 
 Stuck in a pause mode 
 I goes deep like a great white 
 But I'm a stay black 
 No matter how high the pay stacks 
 Or if my rep gets bigger 
 You might get take this nigga out the ghetto 
 But not the ghetto out this nigga... 
 Verse three: j-ro, tash 
 For the balls basketballs 
 Microphones gassin grass (hey) 
 Some of the few things j-ro likes to pass 
 93 mandingo/94 I'm the pharoah 
 'Cause I'm b-bbad to the bone marrow 
 I get wild 
 Wit more styles than the martial arts 
 I need weed 
 I roll more grass than golf carts 
 April 92 you no the ro was a looter 
 Now I'm writin raps on my lab-top computer 
 J-ro the tittie fiend/rap dean/wearin green 
 Been on the scene/since the age of 13 
 I learned I had to earn the mic 
 Now's my turn 
 I got furious styles like larry fishburne... 
 Wit da bitches tunin me in 
 Like it's the young and the restless 
 Next up to bust my shit 
 From the l-i-k-s's 
 Yes it's the freshest 
 Wit lyrics rough around the edges 
 I'll smoke you on the mic 
 Like a pack of benson hedges 
 But... hold up wait 
 I'll bust rhymes that'll circulate 
 That'll wake yo punk ass up like MC eiht 
 'Cause I be rockin' rhymes 
 Since the roof was on fire 
 So point me to the bitch who's the dopest butterflyer 
 I'll make her break it down like she patra when I catch ya 
 Broadway is on the tables 
 While I throw these lyrica atcha 
 So... slow down before ya fuck wit my sound 
 You betta do the hokey pokey 
 And turn ya self around...
