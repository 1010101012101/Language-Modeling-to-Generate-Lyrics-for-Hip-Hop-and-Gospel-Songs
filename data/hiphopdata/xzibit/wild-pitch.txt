(Ras kass) 
 (Yeah, yeah yeah) 
 What, you don't want it, niggas liver than teen summit 
 The wild pitch, America's most drunk and blunted 
 Stick to fishes, black widows kick this vicious 
 Hot shit bitch, wild pitch 
 (Jah skillz) 
 I'm the, funkalistic, rapper choke an instant 
 Got mixed wit, malibu rums and mistic 
 I'm a whole lot on it, yeah just a smidget 
 Just 'cause I live by the beach like ? gidget? 
 You must think I'm small time like that biz midget 
 Add three piece smart mouth like bitches 
 And you got me, jah killa jet ski ills 
 Take me to the edge like poppin' pills 
 Straight up, no chase, hold up unless I'm bein followed 
 Never swallow anything unless it's from a bottle 
 And that's the whole truth, and nothin' but the truth so help me god 
 By the powers invested upon my 5 footaz squad 
 You ain't ready, oh 'cause you dress like psychadelli 
 You the gmc like chevy, I put a levy on yo cash flow 
 Just a little something to let yo ass know 
 Who to give 2 kind to when you pass go 
 Chorus (xzibit) 
 You dealin' wit alumni criteria 
 The one's that throwin' wild pitches in ya area 
 Strikin you out, sending you back to the dugout 
 We goin' up to your microphones pullin the plug out 
 Superior, alumni criteria, we the mcs that you make you feel inferior 
 Throwin' wild pitches, fuckin' your riches and your bitches 
 Rasassination, jah skillz, and xzibit 
 (Ras kass) 
 I ejaculate on blind justice wit the jury's se quested 
 And escape, run in a nigga's face like hannibal lector 
 The aqua-mati, my pen is penitentiary 
 Potenially plain paid for protocall pacific pro perfect cap pealer 
 Performing skull circumsitions, when I position the prism 
 Permiscuis wit other people's pussy ? pawn? wit the playa like big pun 
 Poisonous poet, I master "p" like uh! 
 Skillz ? cotted? enabled 
 Herb you just and ingrown hair in the world of tweezers 
 We can dance before I crack MC's like gator in jungle fever 
 Got them speakin' in number like soundscan 
 Severed the ears off your soundman, black israelite 
 Like four-hundred and forty-four thousand 
 Niggas talk like dog, we'll walk like cat 
 I'm ozzy osbourne bitin the head off of rats 
 When they started bustin', fuck the Russian 
 We playin' west Indian roulette, ? some of mine? blind get wet 
 >From new jack to vet I can modem 
 Comes off like three adam's apples in the inner scrotum 
 My rhyme ?, clearin my sinus, bitch slime on your iceberg 
 And let the virus cross appliance 
 (Xzibit) 
 Give birth to earth to planet, we harder than granite 
 And concrete, man made could never compete, complete down to the core 
 Weighing in tons, hotter than lava, god, javi, jahovah, allah heavenly father 
 Nuns to bank robbers, wealth beyond the dollar 
 Here to school the scholar, make new born babies 
 No live for no bitch or lady, they try to play me 
 We flowin like the Mississippi to the river euphrates 
 One-hundred and eighty times two, one complete rotation 
 Fit any situation for a small donation, live on location 
 Third planet from the sun 
 Travel 24 hours you spend a lifetime to run 
 Witness the slave shot he bolted to a gat and a gun 
 >From hitler, musolini, to attila the hun 
 Imagine existence wit no fear, tears never shed here 
 One day for me could last a thousand years 
 The first element baby, one two...
