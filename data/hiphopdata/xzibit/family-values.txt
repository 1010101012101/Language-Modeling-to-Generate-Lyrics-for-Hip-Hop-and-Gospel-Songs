This how you make me feel (x3) 
 That's how I know its real 
 Take you around the world (x3) 
 'Cause you're my baby girl (x3) 
 'Cause you're my my my 
 'Cause you're my baby girl (x3) 
 'Cause you're my my my 
 This how you make me feel 
 That's how I know its real 
 Take you around the world 
 'Cause you're my baby girl 
 I know you feelin' good 
 I know you feelin' right 
 You see me ridin', you ridin' wit me, our shit is tight 
 Self made millionare refined myself 
 My success god bless not defined by wealth 
 Cum on 
 We live in crazy times 
 Niggers that lost their minds 
 We wanna fuck every fuckin' chicken we fuckin' find 
 But then there comes a time 
 When you start to grow 
 But you ain't growin' with me and its startin' to show 
 Before I say I can't live without you 
 Lets sit and have a talk about family value 
 Now listen 
 I see you got some kids 
 That you ain't never with 
 Your baby father put hands on you some crazy shit 
 So he gon' pay for that 
 Fuck with niggers who rap 
 Most of that quality time is spent on your back 
 Now before I devote the rest of my life 
 Can you at least show a nigger you can boil some rice (ha ha) 
 Is that to much to ask 
 Am I movin to fast 
 Do you have anything to offer me besides some ass 
 You think you high class 
 The upper esulon 
 But spent all your grit money in the hair salon 
 I'm sposed to help you out, but it just made me think 
 You ain't ready for the world, you ain't ready for me 
 Dam baby I see they drivin' you crazy 
 Because your bodies amazin I know you wanted to phase me, but hey 
 I've seen alot of girls 
 Messed up alot of curls 
 U ain't gon' keep me with sex when only sex occurs 
 Want you to think ahead, not just give me head 
 Want you to make a household, baby, not just the bed 
 I know they seen is what you seem to see, 
 But you need'nt to be but believe you me, baby girl 
 They jus' gon' use you up (use you up) 
 Fuck you and bruise you up (bruise you up) 
 They got no family values 
 They ain't gon' choose you up (choose you up) 
 We disrespect ourselves 
 We think we livin' well 
 I could be wrong in this song but only time will tell 
 You maybe thinkin' 'hey X you just a hypocrite' 
 'You actin' like you never called a girl a fuckin' bitch' 
 Nah it's not that (that), but it's like this (this) 
 We need change and I'm just man enough to say this shit
