Ya had it, ya lost it, ya leeced it, ya flossed it 
 Henny-spell brew, now ya comin' up off it 
 He brought it, he rolled it, he passed it, you smoked it 
 Now ya fucked up off some weed mixed with coke shit 
 Ya love her, ya hate her, ya fucked her, ya raped her 
 25 or life 'cause ya can't control your anger 
 It's heavy, it's deep, it's solid, it's weak 
 Hears people say about your record in your street check it 
 Be careful watcha wish for 
 Ya fuck around ya get it, I get it, I had it, I spit it, I gettin' wished a minute 
 So where my niggas at, what part of the game is that? 
 I pay my dues now nobody tryin' to pay me back 
 And if I did, I'd probably have as much as shaq 
 My life is the movies so listen to the soundtrack 
 It's what it's all about, ya better stall me out 
 I feel the aim with the name you niggas callin out 
 If ya feelin' how I'm feelin' and yo ready and willin' 
 Then come to the table and put it together 
 Who doin' it better come bounce wit me (come on!) 
 You can smoke a whole ounce wit me (right on!) take 'em out 
 If ya movin how I'm movin and ya chosen and proven 
 So lose the illusion of top-guns due to confusion 
 Come bounce wit me (come on!) 
 You can smoke a whole ounce wit me (right on!) take 'em out 
 I'm tired, I'm hungry, you're lazy, disgusting 
 Ya lay about the house and ya never do nothin' 
 Ya seen it, believed it, you planned, conceived it 
 Whisper me the bullshit, bitch I don't need it 
 You cheated, YOU cheated, we cheated, so beat it 
 Eat it like a dick bitch, you two concede it 
 You broke it, replaced it, I slammed it, I chased it 
 Hands in the air if ya love gettin' wasted baby 
 You've never seen this before 
 You better come and get it 
 U wit it, I'm wit it, I'm busy baby, u fuckin' wit it 
 Is it your place or mine? 
 Don't wanna waste your time 
 Yeah you can get it how you want it it'll blow your mind 
 It's overtime to your pride in the public grind 
 I hit from behind, and leak you when I break your spine 
 It's what it's all about, you better stall me out 
 It's just a game wit a name you bitches callin oooouuut 
 If ya feelin' how I'm feelin' and yo ready and willin' 
 Then come to the table and put it together 
 Who doin' it better come bounce wit me (come on!) 
 You can smoke a whole ounce wit me (right on!) take 'em out 
 If ya movin how I'm movin and ya chosen and proven 
 So lose the illusion of top-guns due to confusion 
 Come bounce wit me (come on!) 
 You can smoke a whole ounce wit me (right on!) take 'em out 
 Pop it, drink it, float it, sink it 
 Plan to stop me then you better re-think it 
 Drive it, use it, pimp it, abuse it 
 Shit muhfuckers do the hip hop music 
 I'm livin', I'm dyin', I'm laughin', I'm cryin 
 Pop to a knees bitch let's start flyin 
 I love it, I taste it, I touched it, I faced it 
 Breakin down the bullshit, back to the basics 
 I had to kick in the door, that's how I had to get in 
 I shittin with lyrics and getting betta so fucken print it 
 Getting gangsta wit it, the best that ever did it 
 Hittin and quit it my nigga you shouldn't babysit it 
 We need more MC's and less wannabes 
 360' of reality 
 That's what it's all about, killin' me haul 'em out 
 Nothing to aim, with the name you niggas callin oooouuuttt 
 If ya feelin' how I'm feelin' and yo ready and willin' 
 Then come to the table and put it together 
 Who doin' it better come bounce wit me (come on!) 
 You can smoke a whole ounce wit me (right on!) take 'em out 
 If ya movin how I'm movin and ya chosen and proven 
 So lose the illusion of top-guns due to confusion 
 Come bounce wit me (come on!) 
 You can smoke a whole ounce wit me (right on!) take 'em out
