West, South Central 
 (Verse 1: Ras Kass) 
 If money ain't foldin' homie I'm not rollin' 
 Talk a gang of shit, spit out my colon 
 Rip Dog and Non-Affiliated made us, we dirt 
 Make you wanna go to the swap meet and buy a white t-shirt 
 What's a G worth 
 The turf we lurk was worth a G before my birth 
 I walk these streets throwin' dirt wads 
 99th and Watts, playin' in the feed lots 
 We not afraid to bang, go to keys knot 
 And knees off, summertime swim in that real rugged piece off 
 Then see y'all, let a nigga know 
 What info gat, Beretta nigga know 
 Talkin' 'bout a po-po, undercover in the low-low 
 Tryin' to extort you for yo dough 
 That's a no, no 
 Take 3 outta 4 like the Late Show 
 Bounce, rock, Golden State 
 From the place where the one time is known to hate 
 What's right, what's wrong, erase the line 
 Make up ya mind and choose ya side 
 Bounce, rock, Golden State 
 From the place where the one time is known to hate 
 What's right, what's wrong, cross the line 
 Off everything I love, I'ma handle mine 
 (Verse 2: Saafir) 
 I'm sick of these punk ass po-po's 
 Bendin' my corners in slow-mo, lookin' for my cuzo 
 In the west-bound to DP 
 To Bernie Park down to Dog Town, West Coast to roll, it's hot now 
 With choppers that spit them hollow point tips 
 To get off that shit, between they come and they lips 
 I keeps it 'cause I heard the streets runnin' this shit 
 My nigga Rafe doin' eleven in the Fed, to the head 
 Off the Motorola kite, late night life (What chu' dealin' with) 
 I'm gettin' rich so we can get bricks that you can end with 
 And if you from the pen then pesos and yen 
 Even then them boys behind me 
 The government poised but I got L's, gats, insurance 
 And I'm ridin' with a decoy slumpin' 
 The coast is clear, yo the roast is here 
 (Golden State Warriors) 
 Talk the street life, walk the street life 
 Love the street life, live the street life 
 By the street life, supply the street life 
 Ride and stay tight, what's that life like 
 Talk the street life, walk the street life 
 Love the street life, live the street life 
 By the street life, supply the street life 
 Ride and stay tight, what's that life like 
 (Verse 3: Xzibit) 
 I could care less who was suckin' on the president's dick 
 While me people formin' habits they can't kick 
 Makin' me sick to my stomach 
 And you can try to look away 
 But everyday I'm reminded that we came from it 
 We got our name from it 
 I set the tone, loose chrome, flesh and bone 
 And protect my own 
 I ain't unique there's five million of us runnin' the streets 
 And the rest is on lockdown for tryin' to hold the block down 
 I gotta a right to be hostile 
 Used to drink a little Henny and cool it 
 Now I abuse it 
 My only justice is when I lock, load, aim, and use it 
 Smooth the trigga, fill the whole room with chamber music 
 I know niggas that had it all and blew it 
 Had like a big-body Mercedes so get into it 
 Smash the gas pedal, heavy-metal 
 It's the never-ending saga of God versus the Devil
