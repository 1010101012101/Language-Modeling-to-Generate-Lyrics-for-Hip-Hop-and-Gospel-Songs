I ain't havin' that, I ain't havin' that 
 I ain't havin' that, I ain't havin' that [redman] 
 (Xzibit) 
 >From now till forever it's the likwit MC 
 X to the z, you get banned from TV 
 Fuckin' wit me, likwit niggas l-a-c 
 Captivate, visually stimulate the whole country (what you see?) 
 In God we trust, but don't trust us 
 I'm ready to bust some lead in disgust 
 My homie tony touch said relax, roll a dutch 
 I'm on the grind like a clutch, bust ya, they never had this much 
 That'll take it to the streets, play the game never forfeit 
 This same time next year, we goin' corporate 
 You can't force what don't fit 
 Your style is like a pistol wit no kick, you're weak and you don't hit 
 Bitches catch nuttin but dick, fuck the bs 
 Beat it to death, call triple seis, triz from ts 
 Yeah, hennesey for everbody in my empire 
 Enemies get kennedy-ed in my line of fire 
 (Tash) 
 Tash swings like mark mcgwire, x swings like sammy sosa 
 These guns up in my hoslter got me on the wanted poster 
 Runnin' from the law, tryin' to stay low-key 
 Old e and d&d lace the 50 MC 
 Then it's back to lax, rough beats and concepts 
 They know they can't smoke me so they send me bomb threats 
 I'm rough like sex wit my ex 
 Tash beat the pussy up for old times sake, and then he just 
 Dash to cassettes, I hold the vinyl title 
 Xzibit holds it down wit the rifle 
 I'm runnin' wit the trifle, la tell these thugs 
 That new york city don't need no bloods (why?) 
 'Cause next comes the crips, that's when the city flips 
 Niggas dyin' over colors when it's all about the chips 
 So read it off the lips of the alki bum-rusher 
 I'll fuck you up so bad tony wouldn't wanna touch ya
