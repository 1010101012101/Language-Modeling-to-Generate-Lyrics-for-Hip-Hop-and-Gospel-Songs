Keep on actin' like it ain't gon' happen 'til it happen 
 When it happen you gon' wish it never did, muthafucka 
 Hey baby sexy lady, you make them pants look crazy 
 I know you're schemin' have you leavin' screamin', fuck you pay me 
 L.A. got tons of dameys, that's quick to have that baby 
 And try to squeeze you for every penny that you thought of makin' 
 These streets is fuckin' vicious, can't make the wrong decisions 
 They have you shot up and shot up, caught up, behind some bitches 
 Handle yo' business homey, 'cause ain't no homies in business 
 So many people in this business be so fuckin' phony 
 I see right through them traps, these niggaz run they yaps 
 But when it really crack them pussy niggaz runnin' laps 
 I clap 'em in they tracks, my paper come in stacks 
 And stacks of rubberbands thicker than a paperback 
 Just let the Henny flow, go where you wanna go 
 My party heavyset, ready set baby, here we go 
 It's not a fuckin' game, you know my fuckin' name 
 I'm number one with a motherfuckin' bullet Mayne 
 Keep on actin' like it ain't gon' happen 'til it happen 
 When it happen you gon' wish it never did, muthafucka 
 My soldiers come with missiles, gauges grenades and pistols 
 Bitch you're all in front of the paper dyin' to press the issue 
 My soldiers gettin' at you, full clip is spittin' at you 
 You duck and stuck in position just like a fuckin' statue 
 Nigga I'm quarterbackin', we got it fully crackin' 
 And poppin' and showin', no signs of stoppin' with options 
 Fuck the industry, derive energy from Hennessy 
 Literally I smoke like a chimney 
 You know we got them Hummers tight, we got them numbers right 
 They wanna catch you, get naked, beggin' to spend the night 
 Here go some good advice, come through steppin' light 
 Believe me, extremely easy to lose your life 
 Get 'em up and keep 'em up, they tryin' to get me touched 
 If you gon' swang it, nigga brang it, I don't give a fuck 
 Fin' to make this party jump, fin' to make this club bounce 
 So take your shoes off 'fore you step yo' ass in my house 
 Keep on actin' like it ain't gon' happen 'til it happen 
 When it happen you gon' wish it never did, muthafucka 
 Bitch we keep it crackin' right, we bring it back to life 
 Biohazard motherfuckers that's spreadin' like a parasite 
 We ain't the talkin' type, you get the target sight 
 Lee Boyd Malvo, can't stop me now no 
 Get yo' fuckin' paper up, we had to snatch it up 
 Full metal jacket stay clack clackin' to back 'em up 
 Don't even think about it, you get your shit rerouted 
 Straw for your food, have you pissin' through a plastic tube 
 I know you fuckin' hate it, we stay inebriated 
 Break out the Hennessy bottle baby and regulate it 
 It's not a fuckin' game, you know my fuckin' name 
 I'm number one with a motherfuckin' bullet Mayne 
 Keep on actin' like it ain't gon' happen 'til it happen 
 When it happen you gon' wish it never did, muthafucka 
 Keep on actin' like it ain't gon' happen 'til it happen 
 When it happen you gon' wish it never did, muthafucka
