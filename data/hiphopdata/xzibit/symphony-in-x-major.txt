-Xzibit- 
 Time to snap out of it welcome to the real 
 World life like a hithcock flick, stick to the script, 
 If she can't stick t0 the script stick to this dick, 
 How she acting up for the fith, digging this shit 
 We don't need conversation, just crowd participation, 
 If ya here on vacation we got rules and regulations 
 Separate myself from y'all, segrigation is it 
 Turn it upragation trying to stop xzibit 'n' dre 
 Humiliation, pure elevation got me 
 Some inspiration, to bitches and bubble baths. a beautiful 
 Invitation, got a live occupation 
 Live for the moment I'm faced with an altercation 
 Man-handle'n my opponents, I got eyes in the back 
 Of my head, I never sleep so they blood shot red, 
 Yo we so far ahead of our time if we could stop life 
 And press rewind you still wouldn't catch up till 2 K and 
 Dime so turn it up 
 Turn it up (turn it up) 
 This is it (this is it) 
 We da shit (we da shit) 
 Step with it (step with it) 
 Give a fuck (give a fuck) 
 Who you wit (who you wit) 
 Turn it up (turn it up)

 Truthfully speaking its lonely up here all by myself 
 So I had to come down and had to pass around some 
 Help from NWA to whatever's next make sure it says andre 
 Young in bold leters on big checks. ya shit ain't selling 
 Fuck it get doctor dre on it . u gotta budget I'll get 
 Down give me half of it one session one song, I'm gone 
 First week you hit the streets a star is born to add to my 
 Universe let me show you who can invade who Nigga 
 And who can do the worse warning from the Surgeon General, 
 Watch out for fake hits and bullshit that sounds 
 Identical pick it up read tha credits who you thought it was 
 Twenty years in the game with and constant buzz 
 Pick a year any year see how hot I was same shit today 
 Still don't give a fuck! 
 Stay in your place you can't face what we bringing to 
 The game bounce like this (bounce like this) blaze your 
 Shit and get high for me! 
 -Xzibit-

 This product not to be sold no you can't cook it over a stove 
 U can flip and come back wit a mit don't make me reach to 
 Limo tit. I just want my twenty percent, this is dedicated to 
 The people that spoke too soon I think I stop shooting those 
 Niggas and shoot for the moon, mother fuckers turn respect 
 On and off like a light switch I'm never be seen like fericon 
 Fucking the white bitch jump I won't flintch, dump I don't miss, 
 Its hopeless I'm never losing faith my focus so say what ya 
 Gotta say, everyday a holiday we don't blow the roof we 
 Blow the whole fucking spot away, organize religion, 
 Like organize crime organize mind, organize the 
 Nickles 'n' dimes, organize vocaby organizing my rhymes 
 Organizing my bizz, and organizing my times.
