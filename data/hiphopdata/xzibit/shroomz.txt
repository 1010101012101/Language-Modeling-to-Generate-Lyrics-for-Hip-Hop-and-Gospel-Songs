It's a long day Friday 
 It's like movin on this way 
 Got Xzibit up tight, right 
 Partner came through wit two white boys 
 (Duuude) 
 Talkin' noise 'bout a hot spot 
 Where bitches come alone 
 And niggas don't cock block 
 Let the top drop 
 And we out 
 Hit the liquor store 
 Give me Olde-E and three blunts 
 No make it four 
 Anything else 
 (Vitamin C pills and orange juice) 
 What are you drinking gin 
 (No dude it's the shroomz) 
 The shroomz? (what?) 
 Yeah that's some other shit 
 One of the reasons why George Clinton sees the mother ship 
 How high it make you get 
 Fucked up? 
 Throw it up, guts 
 Or do it have you stuck wit soft dick and can't fuck 
 Hold up 
 Now chew 'em up and slam the orange juice 
 Vitamin c chase 
 Kill the taste 
 You can tell its nasty by the look on my face 
 Don't get it twisted like a nigga coked up 
 And druggied down 
 See cannibus and mushrooms be comin' from the ground 
 All natural 
 Post it at the club 
 Looking funny style 
 Tight slack 
 Pimp feather hat 
 Where the bitches at 
 Here 
 We giving orders at the bar holding money 
 When all of a sudden 
 All the people started looking funny 
 And started lookin' runny 
 And likwitfy 
 Right before my very eye 
 This is a different kind of high 
 (Oh shit, you see this shit 
 This motherfuckers melting and shit) 
 Niggas and bitches walkin' by that I recognize 
 Feeling hypnotized 
 Pupils dilated changing size 
 That's when I heard the battle cries from across the room 
 Set these crooked niggas straight 
 Liquid krew 
 Activate 
 Form of 
 A bunch of wild niggas mashing you 
 Came crashing through 
 Elbows and right hooks for you 
 We got thrown out by this time 
 My shit is blown out 
 Pull the phone out 
 Accelleration and we bone out 
 In the zone out beyond 
 Captain Kirk and Klingons 
 Shit that I'm on 
 Be high powered like a yukon 
 Back to my house 
 Fucked up 
 Trying to see straight 
 How much of that bullshit did I actually take 
 (2 grams duuude) 
 God damn 
 No wonder why I feel like an underneath told the white boy faggot 
 We got beef 
 Over did it homes 
 Niggas playin' bones in the living room 
 Restless 
 Try to find anything to mess with 
 Where my keys at 
 Pickin' up clothes 
 Trying to fold this shit 
 See my riot gage on the wall 
 Better unload this shit 
 Fucked up niggas and fire arms don't mix right 
 Cocked back the chamber 
 Dumping shells till it felt light 
 Thought I dumped the all 
 Counted 7 
 But it was 8 
 Straight gone 
 Point the barrel at the flow and let it go 
 (Fuck!, shit!...wooow... ah ah ah its cool, I just shot the flow man. 
 It's all good, it's all good... ah ah where everbody at, ah shit (haha) 
 Fuckin' wit dat shit
