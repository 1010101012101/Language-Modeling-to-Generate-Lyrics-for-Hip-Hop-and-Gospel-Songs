 Xzibit do your thing 
 Verse 1: (Xzibit) 
 You get permanently put on your ass, 
 Like penny pin the grass 
 Whenever you trespass on Alkaholik territory (Yeah, Yeah) 
 More savage than any rapper on your waster 
 I regulate, extortin' on ya R&B label mate 
 Xzibit rates the state 
 Cross me or cause me 
 Fuck Ziggy and Flossy 
 I'm tryin' to keep the government off me 
 Dogin' hard time and house arrest 
 Whatta you expect, findin' what ya never forget 
 'Cause you're sellin' wolf tickets that your ass can't pay 
 While I displace, kill, blast down at Cassius Clay 
 In this prime time, buckle for mine 
 Use the nickel and dime 
 You on felony crime, 
 But now I bust mine 
 Instead of bustin' at enemies when the sun go down 
 Me and my niggas with a fat one 
 Smoke 'em all down to nothing 
 Crushin' rappers, spare when it's like Jehovah 
 Swore we haven't been sober 
 Since 21 and over

 King Tee broadcaster raw 
 Optical intoxication 
 Fludge your videostation 
 Scramblin' any playahation 
 But some of these fools got tricks in they boxes 
 ?So I'm bloxin', pull they hoes back in the soxin? 
 Tha Alkaholiks rock shit 
 Any which way man I got shit

 With some fatal shock shit 
 And this district's domestic 
 As the mystic, registic and I get's hectic

 Smoke weed, drink hard, my god

 Called take it back like repo 
 And I got foes on my shelf like homes T-Paul

 Posted up with three French bras at the need bowl 
 I got dressed, with the speed off a cheetah

 Hopped in my 2-seater 
 Sunshine, drivin' down fine 
 Walk a 1 on 3.9 
 They playin' oeh so fine 
 Got 'em on the fifth floor 
 Knocked at the door

 Where we drinkin' at, These my homegirls right here, 
 What y'all drinkin' right now, fuck that, All we got
