Young money, love money, blood money, right? 
 Your money, war money, more money, right? 
 They don't even really understand what it's like, electro livin' in the land of the light 
 Electro livin' 
 Electro livin' in the land of the light 
 Electro livin' 
 Electro livin' in the land of the light 
 We're electro livin' in the land of the light 
 Everything is switched on still something don't work right 
 Do whatever you've got to do to make it through the night 
 But what ever you do, don't believe the hype 
 Lets have a little natter 'bout a couple of matters 
 Pour me a cup of cha, a little butter and crackers 
 The kids are unruly, news does not fool me 
 And if TV don't play me no more just YouTube me 
 Hit 'em with electro retro meets techno 
 Rap-rock-kid, push back the threshold 
 So take your best shot with your best shooter 
 Here we are now, entertain us computer 
 Young money, love money, blood money, right? 
 Your money, war money, more money, right? 
 They don't even really understand what it's like, electro livin' in the land of the light 
 Electro livin' 
 Electro livin' in the land of the light 
 Electro livin' 
 Electro livin' in the land of the light 
 We're electro livin' in the land of the light 
 Everything is switched on still something don't work right 
 Do whatever you've got to do to make it through the night 
 But what ever you do, don't believe the hype 
 They can't change what it is just by puttin' a name on 
 Or make something art just by shovin' a frame on 
 Or become less guilty by passing the blame on 
 Or rant with Akala, where's your brain gone 
 I'm the rapper that's dapper 
 No matter the chatter 
 The illest whipper snapper 
 From the land of sausage and batter 
 We're fat and gettin' fatter 
 And the man are mad as a hatter 
 The gofer or gaffer? 
 Well, bruv I'm the latter 
 Young money, love money, blood money, right? 
 Your money, war money, more money, right? 
 They don't even really understand what it's like, electro livin' in the land of the light 
 Electro livin' 
 Electro livin' in the land of the light 
 Electro livin' 
 Electro livin' in the land of the light 
 We're electro livin' in the land of the light 
 Election riggin' in the land of the right 
 Do what ever you've got to do to make it through the night 
 But what ever you do, don't believe the hype 
 Things are what they seem 
 Despite what they tell you 
 Beware of the truth or they'll send you to Bellevue 
 If you take a closer look and uncover the veil 
 You will see they're just salesmen with nothing to sell you 
 With these wags with their fags 
 And christian dior bags 
 Shag and they brag and pose for lads mags 
 It is sad we are sad for things we cannot have 
 But we are not sad for Baghdad 
 Young money, love money, blood money, right? 
 Your money, war money, more money, right? 
 They don't even really understand what it's like, electro livin' in the land of the light 
 Electro livin' 
 Electro livin' in the land of the light 
 Electro livin' 
 Electro livin' in the land of the light
