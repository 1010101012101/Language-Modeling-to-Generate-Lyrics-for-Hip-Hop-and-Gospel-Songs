Behind my painted smile 
 When all the revolutionary noise is nothing but a lost little boy 
 Confused and insecure, arrogant and oversure 
 An egotistical prick so come on please praise me more 
 It's great that my music bettered you 
 But I contemplate murder every day so don't put me on a pedestal 
 Plus truly, just the vehicle the music just runs through me 
 In my better moments I could let the universe use me 
 Behind my smile there's generations of pain 
 Self-hatred, ingrained miseducated my brain 
 Decimated the place where my dead relations were slain 
 Not just physically but mentally penetrated our veins 
 What you got inside hasn't gotta die once 
 It can die a lot of times, that I promise my son 
 Analyse every song that I've done 
 Tryna fight colonialism with a colonised tongue 
 Here I stand again 
 Living in sin 
 Caught up, in the dream 
 Behind the painted smile 
 Behind my painted smile is the most painful grimace 
 This mental prison I live in 'cause I am so conditioned 
 By my privilege, what a strange contradiction 
 To grow up brown in Britain and know that your living 
 Was paid for by a carcass that resembles yours 
 Born in the heart of the empire 
 You're worth more than I was just like you 
 But less then the native ones 
 Raised by my mum but in this world I am a father's son 
 Behind my painted smile, a very flawed human being 
 Done many things that I regret and never knew the reason 
 What do you believe in, truth or freedom or are you deceiving? 
 I don't wanna die in prostration to European's 
 They say the answer is within you and nowhere else 
 Understand the vision man on a mission to know himself 
 This is for my co-defendants no retreat and no surrender 
 You probably think that we don't remember Ota Benga 
 Here I stand again 
 Living in sin 
 Caught up, in the dream 
 Behind the painted smile 
 The smile is painted on my face is tainted by a frown 
 Picture in the pocket's of blood that decorate the town 
 Trigger jum bullets sung and guns hum 
 Then everyone that's dead was somebody's someone 
 Behind my painted smile I feel like a naked child 
 Maybe rapping ain't for now 'cause my passion is fading out 
 Up early though I search and roam along this dirty road 
 Just another traveller taking a long journey home 
 All this talk of intervention to protect on what is the intention 
 Same as it ever was the colonial past and present 
 And more respect for most of the right wingers 
 Than the paternalistic patronizing liberal bigot 
 Our way of life is so divine, we should intervene 
 Select war and export the British dream 
 Behind cinema screens there's much that isn't seen 
 George Clooney war movies never bring our children peace 
 Yo fam, you ever wake up and just feel like fucking off 
 And never coming back to this place and just cutting off? 
 All the time, almost did last year 
 The trouble was the bloody cops had me running in and out the bloody dock 
 I been there brother, though I don't promote it in this rap shit 
 I ain't a stranger to having my back on their blue plastic 
 Can't keep us captive 
 We see the tactics 
 To keep us passive 
 We beat the fascists 
 Release the classics 
 And reach the masses! 
 Here I stand again 
 Living in sin 
 Caught up, in the dream 
 Behind the painted smile 
 Here I stand again 
 Living in sin 
 Caught up, in the dream 
 Behind the painted smile
