We've been on this ting for so long now 
 10 years at the top of my craft 
 Maybe not at the top of the charts 
 But who could tell me what independent touring the globe 
 And flows as cold as winter was in hand me down clothes 
 Live shows of the chain Toussaint 
 Seems I was born to be what you ain't 
 A man that uses his art to fight 
 But still prospers in these hard times 
 So what's to hate when you're known around the globe, it's great 
 And their known around the globe, it's fake 
 The respects so high that 
 Left you in a jail full of lifers 
 A man sit in silence, try that 
 You can't buy that, nah bruv, I am that 
 Not because I'm a killer but because I'm a (?) black 
 Cause contrary to the rumours 
 Our community is not a bunch of delinquents, we are students 
 But don't respect the system made by the killers 
 The ones that paint us as the villains 
 Back to the spittin' 
 Listen, who's really my competition? 
 Really? Is there somethin' that I'm missin'? 
 These kids are kittens fighting with a pitbull 
 Carefull my brother you'll get your ship pulled 
 Who can bang with us? None (What!) 
 Who will stand with us? Come (What!) 
 Who's still doubting us? Dumb (What!) 
 We've been on this ting for so long now 
 You can't bang with us, none 
 You won't stand with us, son 
 You still doubting us, dumb 
 We've been on this ting for so long now 
 I got man puzzled like "I don't get it 
 How is he still so well with so much message" 
 Don't diss the sisters, celebrate killing other blacks 
 But still so fuckin' hard when he raps 
 I give you a tip, swag through the roof 
 It's no excuse to be boring cause you tell the truth 
 When it's said and done, I'm still the same as when I started 
 Ain't having a bar for none of these artists 
 That not giving a fuck gives me strength 
 Now I don't use it on us, use it on them 
 But defend what I have to 
 Sit down Matthew 
 Just one if my deciples, take notes 
 This is not music, this here is a sport 
 Who's ready for the ring ring fire? 
 You man are wetter than man's hair in Shoreditch 
 I think it's time to retire, heir 
 Who can bang with us? None (What!) 
 Who will stand with us? Come (What!) 
 Who's still doubting us? Dumb (What!) 
 We've been on this ting for so long now 
 You can't bang with us, none 
 You won't stand with us, son 
 You still doubting us, dumb 
 We've been on this ting for so long now 
 It's the father, you can call me uncle Akala 
 What's the palava with Ghana 
 Fans here to Ghana, globe, every corner 
 Punish every punk that is posing the hardest 
 Told you we tarnish those that are garbage 
 Get left for dead for opposing the carnage 
 So who's next, who's the best of me clones? 
 Take out a town like Obama with the drones 
 Known for the poems that scorch gin, poor ting 
 Probably (?) a 12 year old girls gassed at your king 
 But we are grown me so only grown women 
 And real hip hop heads, we care for their opinion 
 But where are my dominions? 
 I swear that your Brazilian 
 The way you got brutalised within your own kingdom 
 By this German efficiency, without the bigotry 
 Harder than the life of a black man in Italy 
 Who can bang with us? None (What!) 
 Who will stand with us? Come (What!) 
 Who's still doubting us? Dumb (What!) 
 We've been on this ting for so long now 
 You can't bang with us, none 
 You won't stand with us, son 
 You still doubting us, dumb 
 We've been on this ting for so long now
