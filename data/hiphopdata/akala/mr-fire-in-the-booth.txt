They call me Mr. Fire in the Booth, Booth 
 Don't force me to remind you why 
 Never gave a guy a blight ever who will ramp with I? 
 The half breed seed sprouting his disease 
 Haunting emcees like Desalinise in Napoleon's dream 
 I'm mean, not a team, nor a squad nor a nation 
 Unless it's Haitian 
 Could break the back of my occupation 
 Cooperation is the only clever option open 
 Any choice you're given is fake 
 Kinda like you voting 
 Either way, the victory's mine son 
 Shoulda done as your mum said, listen to dad 
 I gave you life, that's inside of you 
 And, I provided too 
 Now you wanna question the very wisdom that guided you 
 Sounding like enlightened fools 
 Running from a spiteful brawl 
 But in my city we don't know how to be nice at all 
 We know the knife and tool 
 And that life has rules 
 And the youngers use them and lose them just on their bikes to school 
 They call me Mr. Fire in the Booth, Booth 
 They call me Mr. Fire in the Booth, Booth 
 They call me Mr. Fire in the Booth, Booth 
 'Cause I'm always spittin' out the truth, truth 
 They call me Mr. Fire in the Booth, Booth 
 They call me Mr. Fire in the Booth, Booth 
 They call me Mr. Fire in the Booth, Booth 
 'Cause I'm always spittin' out the truth, truth 
 They call me Mr. Fire in the Booth, protect your neck 
 'Cause it's Sun Tzu with a hoodie on, plato with a pair of creps 
 Use to reppin' where there's weapons and never a Santa 
 We turn a stanza to a cancer with poetic banter 
 So no factor that chat which rappers crack 
 I cold Turkey that pratt, and let you have him back 
 If we believe your act that you believe that you can rap 
 You'll get punished for stupid beliefs, and it's more than slaps 
 The impact on the head of the hard headed 
 Bet that he'll get his little rap and facade, deaded 
 In the ring with the king of the paragraphs 
 Come on then sweetheart, let us have a dance 
 Your twinkle toes and pretty pose could never dazzle 
 The one who throws a million souls and it's never hassle 
 Battles are pleasure for a general nobody told you? 
 Smash you a hole that is big enough to snatch your soul through 
 They call me Mr. Fire in the Booth, Booth 
 They call me Mr. Fire in the Booth, Booth 
 They call me Mr. Fire in the Booth, Booth 
 'Cause I'm always spittin' out the truth, truth 
 They call me Mr. Fire in the Booth, Booth 
 They call me Mr. Fire in the Booth, Booth 
 They call me Mr. Fire in the Booth, Booth 
 'Cause I'm always spittin' out the truth, truth 
 I take 'em out 
 (All on my own) 
 'Cause that's the way I'm made 
 Maybe in your culture suicide is being brave 
 The sage of the page makes graves plagued with dark ages 
 And ain't no choice to be buried I only do cremating 
 For little idiots that's not even rated 
 Not even hated not even a factor that needs to be calculated 
 And you can't explain it, much less contain it 
 Roll with us or get crushed, that I've already stated 
 In the plainest terms 
 But fools never learn 
 Still tryna be what they're not like wearing the blondest perm 
 'Cause of loss of purpose, I have you lost on purpose 
 You can't escape the furnace, so best you praise my verses 
 Look around the cooning's a lot 
 I spit a sentence quick like a judge with a coon in the dock 
 But these clowns with their dead sound hate me 
 Still they don't count like a dead brown baby
