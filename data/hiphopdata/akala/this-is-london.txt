The place where you find the coldest ballers you ever seen 
 But they locked up or dead not in the Premier league 
 Best kid that I knew turned fiend by 16 
 It seems things never the way you see in your greams 
 Years past tears start kids turn to teens 
 That sweet child you knew grill done turn mean 
 Daddy left him and reality set in there's bo cream 
 And it's embarrassing goin' school with holes in ya jeans 
 So you know the cycle, it's little bags of green 
 Get expelled and sell the world hell by 16 
 Fuck a couple pristine chicks that suck dick mean 
 Couple bottles of cris sipped and wrist slit mean 
 And it's logical, lucky niggas do time that's horrible 
 Catch the flipside and ya speak with the oracle 
 It's fucked up yeah, but that's just how it is 
 And ain't nuttin' on these roads gonna change but the clip 
 This is London 
 Black tugs bust big slugs 
 This is London 
 Give ya fuckin' punks tough love 
 This is London 
 Single mums dat pump drugs 
 This is London, Bruva this is London 
 (London calling...) 
 The place where it don't matter if you never sold a shot 
 Never run up on a nigga like "gimme what you got" 
 Get ya brain sprayed on the pave, in front of the rave 
 No reason other than niggas is frustrated 
 So many catchin' cases over screw faces 
 And dumb shit like we come from different places 
 London get ya shit smoked like a chalice 
 Same city, different planet from Buckingham Palacee 
 Where young tugs is clutchin' big straps that's Russian 
 And dyin' to buss it what the fuck good is discussions? 
 Where hood rats is suckin' any dick that push a nice sumthin' 
 And them said gyal'a get you set like your life's nothin' 
 'Cause life's nothin' that's just how it is 
 And there ain't nothin' on these roads gonna change but the clip 
 This is London 
 Black tugs bust big slugs 
 This is London 
 Give ya fuckin' punks tough love 
 This is London 
 Single mums dat pump drugs 
 This is London, Bruva this is London 
 (London calling...) 
 The place where you don't fuck with the Turks or the Asians 
 Triads, pikey's, even Caucasians 
 Where them cockney boys will chiv your face, you mug 
 No love, every colour mentality thug 
 But we take it to a whole 'nother level 
 Little girls gettin' shot in the back is not clever 
 Never far from the hood, even in the Sticks 
 Couple wrong turns, get dash out ya whip 
 By some little skinny kid, think he big with the chrome 
 They said he'd be the next Ian Wright but 
 The skunk said no 
 In this place, if you work you're an idiot 
 Most of the smartest muthafuckers illiterate 
 'Cause tax is a bitch, take half of ya pension 
 Just to fight war, now they want congestion 
 And they wonder why we all goin' insane 
 This is London, tell me is your city the same?
