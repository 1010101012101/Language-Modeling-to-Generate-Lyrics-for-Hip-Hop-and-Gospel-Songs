My mind's changed 
 It's part of living this life 
 So wrong or right 
 We expand our mind 
 'Cause my mind's changed 
 I don't know what to say 
 Along the way many wrongs in this place 
 'Cause my mind's changed 
 The things were better before 
 I ain't sure that they matter anymore 
 'Cause my mind's changed 
 My mind's changed 
 In my mind a thousand characters battle to be heard 
 Each one screaming at the top of there lungs 
 So I can't make out a word 
 And all occasion 
 One of the fools within my cranium 
 Recovers the rules, discovers the tools 
 For good communication 
 And the beating ceases a million Jigsaw pieces 
 Shards of my shattered childhood fit together so easy 
 And violence has meaning 
 Poverty is honourable 
 That's me projecting back 
 From the space I am now 
 When you in and you live it 
 It is more than just horrible 
 Any day you wake up feel your life can end now 
 Don't quote me statistics 
 That won't cure the fear 
 When I can see the life expectancy of half of my peers 
 I done made it to thirty 
 Further than my mother though 
 Can't lie, I went off the rails 
 But never did get caught 
 Maybe the strength from my mind 
 Or powers divine 
 Or good old fashion luck will explain it just fine 
 That's why T never passed the stick that night 
 He squashed the beef 
 At time the logical promise was to just cock and squeeze 
 I weren't that guy 
 I was just acting 
 The pride and the confines of my mind 
 I was trapped in 
 Funny how the shit work 
 The way we all grew up 
 To see other young brothers face straight screw up 
 Now I see my brothers and I see my reflection 
 Don't mean I ain't prepared for the worst 
 It mean I just ain't expecting 
 And the fear, and the crave and protection 
 And needing direction 
 I no longer feel the need to mask as aggression 
 My mind's changed 
 It's part of living this life 
 So wrong or right 
 We expand our mind 
 'Cause my mind's changed 
 I don't know what to say 
 Along the way many wrongs in this place 
 'Cause my mind's changed 
 The things were better before 
 I ain't sure that they matter anymore 
 'Cause my mind's changed 
 My mind's changed 
 In my mind I would die for the things I believe 
 But one of the mind's greatest powers is how it deceives 
 And your belief is just dialogue 
 Till your people die a lot 
 Still you got to maintain conviction and never try and stop 
 And I do not, know 
 Nor can I tell you surely 
 Surely, that's pure speculation 
 On what's not been put before me 
 But what the mind conceives 
 I strive to achieve 
 As cliche as that phrase is I believe it's true indeed 
 Belief's powerful 
 The image of Christ 
 Got half the entire planet believing that the saviour is white 
 And skin bleaching and such other sickness 
 Must be understood within us 
 Mind's motivated by 
 Multiple much layered image 
 Yet a million different mind's results the same 
 Like we share a power source 
 Can't disconnect from the mains 
 Yet I call this mind mine 
 Though I know not its aim 
 Can't define it, much less find it 
 Does it reside in my brain? 
 My mind's changed

 'Cause my mind's changed 
 The things were better before 
 I ain't sure that they matter anymore 
 'Cause my mind's changed 
 My mind's changed 
 N my mind there's a nation of its own 
 That I don't condone 
 Much less control 
 Or occupy the phone 
 But nor am I the servant 
 More like an observer 
 Powerless to stop myself 
 Witnessing the murder 
 It's occurring and recurring 
 And nothing's ever certain 
 'Cause the story teller's freestyling 
 Making up the wording 
 As he goes along 
 Just to throw me off 
 So I don't know the plot 
 Even though I am on screen 
 To the credits to from the opening shot 
 And that may sound cryptic 
 But I ain't got a clue 
 How to explain to you 
 The things that we go through 
 I know that you feel it too 
 You're in no more control than I 
 As I child I swore they'd fine the cure so that I wouldn't die 
 Same little child that you could call alone 
 Alone, thinking with discipline that's 20 years old 
 Yet I gone back I can't sit in quiet for two minutes 
 The chatter on my mind is why I produce lyrics 
 It's an overload 
 From the coldest globe 
 That we know is home 
 The only show on the road 
 Been told, ever since ancient Rome 
 Never showing them the course of the flowing 
 Like the force that change the course 
 So we reaping and sewing 
 See the mind is the reason why we feel that we're loved 
 And if you troubling someone's loved ones 
 Then we fiending for blood 
 I we grow up 
 And grow down 
 And go back into the ground 
 And some of the things produced by the mind 
 Might just stick around 
 My mind's changed 
 It's part of living this life
