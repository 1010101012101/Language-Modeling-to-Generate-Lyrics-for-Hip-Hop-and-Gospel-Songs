Yeah, it goes down 
 Yeah, it goes down 
 Uh-huh, it goes down 
 It goes down 
 I thought you knew it went down 
 Believe that 
 Verse One: 
 I rock Versacci, sippin VSOP and Hennessey in foam cups 
 Motorola flips with illegal chips 
 Dip-pin' like Teela where everybody momma collectin money from fiend 
 Five series Beemer, one-hundred and eighty-nine horsepower 
 I like bitched with dimples and nipples the size of silver dollars 
 Rollin' three deep in Eddie Bauers chokin out LAPD Rottweilers 
 Like chihuahuas, all day eryday 
 In Southern California where the dogs and the ribs stay 
 And nowadays fools don't know how to act 
 'Cause we all wanna be Tony Montana 
 Matter of fact, gimme five we got dap, gimme twenty-five 
 We got a bird and profit is made 
 So while the homey cut cavvy with a razor blade 
 I rock beats without baking soda 
 And money gets watched it's only illegal if you get caught 
 Thought you knew cause the DEA do it too 
 Keep separate books for the internal revenue 
 Capitalism is pimps and hoes 
 In ninety-six I 'spose anything goes 
 Big bank take little bank anything goes 
 Legal or illegal however you make your cash flow 
 Big bank take little bank ah anything goes 
 Legal or illegal however you make your cash flow 
 Verse Two: 
 All you PH Ballers, Dirty Mack's need to KG 
 I'd rather be a dope MC than a broke OG 
 I get, manicures to keep my cuticle suitable 
 Player, don't hate me because I'm beautiful 
 I got a pocket full of C-notes and food stamps 
 Just big bills and free meals baby so lamp 
 Cause jealousy gets you burned like bad perms 
 If you live you learn, I spit game like Chick Hearns 
 To women with, measurements of 38-24-36 with DSL's 
 But money talks ESL 
 In the game of Monopoly, if you don't pass go then go di-rectly to jail 
 'Cause I've seen fools that struggle and turn they ownself into the po-po 
 It keeps the humble of they cool low 
 Selling ten dollar J's right up under the man's nose 
 Hah, nigga anything goes 
 One for the money (money), two for the show (show) 
 Three for the ladies but all they wanted was one 
 It's one for the money (money), two for the show (show) 
 Three for the ladies but all they wanted was one 
 Verse Three: 
 Niggaz got stripes like, Tony the Tiger 
 But niggaz got strikes like Oral Hershiser 
 So look alive, inflation rise like yeast 
 S&L scandal stole millions 
 But we need more police to take back our streets, it's drama 
 We all know that one-time be extortin them big-ballers 
 Gettin' extradited with warrants in three states 
 Overcrowded prisons hopin the DA drop the case 
 So uh, I ain't forgot about the homey Kevin 
 He pled no contest and got stretched till ninety-seven 
 Dizmost and Little Dags hold tight 
 I know I seldom shoot kites but I be tryin' to get my pockets right 
 My ideal real is Big Willie pourin out Dom P 
 For the dead homies with bitches splittin Phillies (call it ends) 
 Call it loot scrilla cream green flow or dough 
 But to get mo' nigga, anything goes 
 "It's no disguise, it makes no sense 
 It doesn't fit, if it doesn't fit, you must acquit"
