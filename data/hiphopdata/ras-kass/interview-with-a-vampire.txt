(Ras Kass) 
 You want to talk to God? God never sleeps 
 Ras Kass: Now what came first, the chicken or the egg? 
 God: Armageddon 
 Ras Kass: The arm or leg or leg or arm or head? (God: Ha!) 
 Headin' in your direction 
 The riddle was the answer to the question (God: What) 
 Born of the flesh, what is perfection? 
 (Ras Kass) 
 Inside my mother's womb, doomed to return to the tomb 
 Or was it from the dead I was raised? 
 All too soon to pay, on judgment day 
 Is this beginning or the ending 
 Died sinning, still winning, still grinning, 
 Descending, verdict still pending, born pretending 
 Three-hundred billion men, women and children 
 (God: Cringing) 
 Deja vu, could be I'm dreaming, but we all ask for divine reason 
 While still breathing, and until leaving 
 Who?, What?, When? Where?, How? 
 But most of all why? 
 (God) 
 Why what? 
 (Ras Kass) 
 Do we live just to die? 
 (God) 
 The Book was written way before the after God pitting 
 There is no God but me, mathematically, in division 
 My decision was all inventions 
 I need not mention infinite dimensions 
 But the human mind's flaw was limited comprehension 
 So while you try to travel to Mars and the stars 
 The God manifests through the entire Universe 
 From the Sun, Moon, the Earth 
 I created man in my image and the black man was first 
 The scientific explanation, yeah I made man out of dirt 
 (Ras Kass) 
 But how can a man be first, when it's the woman that's giving birth? 
 (God) 
 Listen, single-celled organisms 
 The homosapien, the Albanian 
 (Ras Kass) 
 What's that? 
 (God) 
 White people 
 (Ras Kass) 
 They keep the world separate and unequal 
 (God) 
 The teach you, right is wrong, wrong is right 
 Up is down 
 Kick the king off his throne, is the planet flat or round? 
 (Ras Kass) 
 Can we really time travel, and is there life in outer space? 
 (God) 
 Wait, you knew all this in the first place 
 You trying to get to God 
 (Ras Kass) 
 But, I've fallen from your grace 
 A billion paths to take, but which one is truly straight? 
 Ras Kass: And what came first, the chicken or the egg? 
 God: Creat amon 
 Ras Kass: The arm or leg or leg or arm or head? 
 Heading in your direction 
 The riddle was the answer to the question 
 Born of the flesh, what is perfection? 
 Ras Kass: What came first, the chicken or the egg? 
 God: Armageddon 
 Ras Kass: The arm or leg or leg or arm or head? 
 Can you walk across water or rise from the dead? 
 I heard they said he lived and the son of man bled 
 (God) 
 It's a process, shit don't just happen, I create it 
 Everything you see and shit you don't, son I made it, and waited 
 I'm the "Big Bang Theory" and "Evolution" 
 Been there, done that, from revolution to prostitution 
 The first and final solution 
 The Qur'an, Bible, and Vedas, is only tools 
 Don't be confused when the medulla oblongata __ 
 (Ras Kass) 
 Oh, so revelations is Genesis 
 (God) 
 Three-sixty degrees are limitless 
 (Satan) 
 Shit, I'm on fucking nemesis 
 (Ras Kass) 
 Who is you? 
 (Satan) 
 Chump, I thought you knew 
 Who else? Lucifer, the lie bearer stupid, the Devil himself 
 He the creator, we all the creations, guess I'm eternal damnation 
 Got you bitches seeking your own salvation 
 Who taught you how to pray? 
 Cause you read it in the book, look, your bear witness to Amen Ray 
 Every day when you say "Amen," and then turn around 
 And preach worshiping false Gods, is an unforgivable sin 
 Yeah the good books is like comic books, you take 'em too literal 
 I tricked you in to believing the power to reason 
 Makes you able to live infinitely, in the physical 
 Guess I'm the pawn com lyrical 
 Basically I tell true lies in general, the yin and the yang 
 The player with a trillion years of game 
 (God) 
 He got you selling your spiritual, for power, money and fame 
 I came out of triple stage darkness, give mortals my attributes 
 But even you made me a mystery God like a lochness 
 A used sign to prove or disprove my existence 
 Trying to align this, artificial intelligence, cloned in a space station 
 Trying to build the Tower of Babylon 
 But you sadly mistaken, when I start erasing homosapiens 
 You looking for an angel with wings 
 I'm 'a bring young niggas with a A-K, fuck the alien 
 (Ras Kass) 
 So what you saying then, you the one that created sin 
 (God) 
 What you call mother nature, is the nature of me (Ras: Oh...) 
 What you call evil, ultimately, was of what's inside of me 
 Matter can't be created or destroyed it just changes shape 
 One God, many people, and many faiths 
 And this is how I wanted to do 'em 
 (Ras Kass) 
 Wait, wait, hold up 
 Father tell me, who is God's son? 
 Ras Kass: And what came first, the chicken or the egg? 
 God: Creat amon 
 Ras Kass: The arm or leg or leg or arm or head? (God: Ha!) 
 Headin' in your direction 
 The riddle was the answer to the question 
 Born of the flesh, what is perfection? 
 Ras Kass: What came first, the chicken or the egg? 
 God: Armageddon 
 Ras Kass: The arm or leg or leg or arm or head? 
 (God) 
 I be the Jesus to your Buddha, the Chrishna at your Junah 
 The Big Kahuna, Jehova Witnesses, suede pumas 
 Zeus, Pharaoh, Elohim, Saturn, Yaweh Jah 
 Arastifa Rah, Allah, the most high 
 But then, only Adam and I 
 I'm the oceans, the trees, a bumble bee, and a glock 
 Earthquakes, how much money you'll ever take 
 The reason behind every mistake mankind continually makes 
 (Ras Kass) 
 Did God create man, or did man need to create God? 
 (Satan) 
 The answer is both, cause how mortals look at God is odd 
 (God) 
 You try to customize me to be comfortable 
 For what you want to do, and how you choose to act 
 The Roman Christians will tell you God ain't black 
 But to get something from nothing is physically impossible, that's a fact 
 (Satan) 
 Black is the combination of all colors 
 (Ras Kass) 
 White is the lack thereof 
 (God) 
 Darkness is beneath the ground, and in the skies up above 
 The clue, is that the true illumination is me, not illuminati 
 'Cause I alone discriminate and eliminate 
 Any who be believing they can rationalize our out reason me 
 Who created the creature, student can never be greater than the teacher 
 Whether its Adam and Eve, or atomic chemistry 
 I'm the one true source of all energy 
 Who will eventually destroy every enemy when I see fit 
 I can't blaspheme my own name so when God damn it, so be it 
 (Satan) 
 That's called the wrath of God, but we gotta deal, I can chill 
 Fuck up the whole world, and in the end, 
 He'll still fulfill his plan, to return man to his original position 
 Nigga gave me some hooks, and said I gets to go fishin' 
 (God) 
 I gave man dominion over the Earth, to master of the wealth 
 But most of my children don't have dominion over theyself 
 (Satan) 
 That's where I come in 
 Call it original sin 
 Who really gives a flying fuck? 
 I taught you how to blood suck, and ultimately self destruct 
 (God) 
 Know the ledge, wise the dome, do the data 
 I'm the alpha 
 (Satan) 
 I'm the beta 
 (Ras Kass) 
 And I'm omega 
 To be or not to be was man's question since conception 
 I think therefore I am, was man's perception 
 But the birth is the resurrection 
 The son of God (God: Christ), or God's son, that lights our entire spectrum 
 You got everlasting life, long as you got day and night 
 Illumination, not education, to bring the blind sight 
 And what you need to know is that you'll never know it all 
 I'm a lowercase g, son of the ever-living God
