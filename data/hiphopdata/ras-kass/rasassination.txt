 What, yeah yeah 
 1-9-9-9, the "Waterproof" nigga 
 Y'all little faggot ass niggas, you always gotta fuckin' comment 
 Y'all like little bitches 
 I'ma pull your skirt up, fo' sho 
 You ain't got enough calcium to have a bone to pick wit' me 
 Like a gracie I choke a nigga out wit' his own gi 
 On me, fuck they whole batallion 
 I'll chop ya head off and wear ya skull like sophomore medallions, papi 
 I'm the one wit da million dolla' smile and three dollars to my name 
 Puttin' black eyes in the game like mascara 
 Diabetic MC's must think shit is sweet 
 These venomous techniques, I leave heat 
 A nigga gots to have it in these streets 
 Bubble eyed G-S on they teams wit beats 
 Screamin, "I'll make ya famous," 
 Write my rhymes in alien and battle niggas in sign language 
 Cowards make a little cheese then enlarge 
 Artificially, like Pamela Anderson Lee's double D's, please 
 I'm bangin' from Belize to Tel Aviv on the Red Sea 
 Racin' Saddam Hussein on Kawasaki jet ski's 
 Walk holdin' my nuts, I don't give a fuck 
 Spit some shit so nasty it'll make Lil' Kim blush 
 Nigga, rasasanation's the name 
 I'ma put it on a bullet, and put it in ya brain 
 See that's wussup, only I don't give a fuck 
 Spit some shit so nasty it'll make lil' Kim blush 
 Nigga, rasasanation is the name 
 I'ma put it on a bullet, and put it in ya brain 
 (Ras Kass) 
 Stay pussy as a pantha, puffin' a hav-a-tampa 
 Askin rappers, "What do you call a million rabbits 
 Walkin' backwards?" (backround) A recedin' hairline 
 You shouldn't be nervous though, 'cause if I blow 
 I'ma buy ya record contrac, neva shoot a video 
 But really though, is ya nice without rent-a-cars and hype? (nope) 
 While me and my 12 homies, sip wine like Jesus Christ 
 Wit' super models bitin' on my ears like Mike Tyson on 
 Fight night (Sho' ya right) 
 The dumb and dumber, my cats pack thunder, 
 And I got mo' wraps than Mumra, mean green 
 Like that super hero with the lantern and ring, 
 Then watch bootleg cable on a 60 inch screen 
 Champagne, greens, in 3d, while bastards out catchin' V.D.'s 
 See me easily givin' fools the finger like E.T. 
 We be rougher than callous (y'all faggots) 
 Sing a love ballad, then toss each other's salad 
 (Ras Kass) 
 Now welcome to the terrordome (fuckin' maricones) 
 Hoes in the ozone, cell phones and clones it's on 
 Busta Rhymes said, "There's only 2 years left" 
 So nowadays I'm playin' Russian roulette wit' a tech (ha) 
 Ghetto holocaust survivor, everyday, 
 From the S.S stormtroopin P.D. in L.A. 
 Tellin' me bein' black on Saturday night is a felony 
 If ya name ain't Michael Jordan or 
 Bill Bellamy, you ass out (mash out) 
 Cause a lot of white people is racist that's why I'm 
 Bustin' nuts in their teenage daughters faces, Homie 
 'Cause when it rains it pours, Got me wearin a six foot 
 Condom, screamin' "FUCK DA WORLD" 
 Makin' butterfly-ass niggas commit insecticide 
 Half god - 50% zilla - illa - my alphabet slitha across 
 Ouiji boards from the philla-gilla, 
 Have dead niggas dancin around they graves like Thriller 
 (Ras Kass) 
 Yeah, what, the "Waterproof", Stu'B'Doo on the track 
 Rhettmatic Beat Junkies on the scratch 
 Listen, all y'all niggas be having too much to say man, 
 Y'all niggas can eat a fat big dick 
 If you're pissed off you dying with your dick in your hand, guaranteed 
 All y'all bitch ass niggas 
 Trying to play me on the Liberaci Versace tip 
 I'ma catch you outside your mansion with a big four fifth 
 Rasassination
