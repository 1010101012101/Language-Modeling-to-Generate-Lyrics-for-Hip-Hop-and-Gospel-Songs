(Intro: Ras Kass) 
 Ah what's crack-a-lackin zr's and shit 
 Ya know DJ the boy brooklyn's own masses

 Ahha if you like the way it goes 
 Keep it ra-ra big bank money and hoes 
 Look at ma-ma oh wee losing her clothes 
 You get na-da bitch please go work them hoes 
 Ahha if you like the way it goes 
 Keep it ra-ra big bank money and hoes 
 Look at ma-ma oh wee losing her clothes 
 You get na-da go work them classic saving hoes 
 (Verse One: Ras Kass) 
 These niggaz rowdy-rowdy never rains in Southern Cali 
 Only clowdy, howey hit the valley in black Denali's 
 Like I am Johnny Gotti street on me they rock Armani's 
 Sorry somebodies baby mama got fucked liked Oochie Wally Wally 
 Probably I will be ariving early at my platinum party 
 Poppin' wheelies on a Decardi 
 Bacardi got me arrogant, grouchy and cocky like jocky 
 I be to complicated to copy can't stop me 
 Cock lockly my block is craving for brocolli 
 My nuts to big homey they got me walking notly 
 I pop three collars at a time that's mine my dimes in every rhyme oh oh 
 (Fuck 'em) 
 (Verse Two: Ras Kass) 
 So quick so fast young niggaz in the street is quick to blast 
 So get your cash up mad and sag your pance see that's the show 
 They them bitch niggaz like eskimo 
 Cops better be ro-bo we refuse to move slow 
 Yet know Ras-y Kass-y at Hard Rock Cafe with Floyd Mayweather 
 Cussin out the ballet, shoes by ballets 
 Keep a nigga on his toes like ballet, keeps a bitch like Cali 
 Next to me how I scooped a movie or I slang 
 With big drinks, big smokes, basically big thangs 
 So kick box before with get in your ass like shit stains 
 Bitch jock aka we switch names

 Son of-ma-bitch that's how I lossed my fiance 
 She said say my name I came and said Beyonce
