Ah, celebrate 
 Hahaha, yeah, ah 
 Vita Brevis, Ars Longa 
 Life is short, art is long 
 It's been a long time, I shouldn't have left you 
 But Priority Records be fucking up, nephew 
 Extraterrestrial poet, my pen stroke is grotesque 
 Rugged nigga, abrasive to any fo'flesh 
 So let's paint a thousand words worth a picture 
 Panoramic though, more esoteric than hieroglyphs and scriptures 
 And chemical mixtures, spit yours, not just kick words 
 Spit swords when we joust from the mouth dawg 
 Heard he got the hottest shit out 
 But Titanic emcees somehow manage to freeze 
 Fracture your flows so bandage your steez, no royalties 
 Subtract his mathematics like I was dropping satanic degrees 
 Long time no see chico, still eating pussy at the Nico? (ha ha) 
 I'm screaming "Power to the people" 
 Most times, genius is misunderstood, but understand 
 You stand under unstable tables of foundation 
 My true occupation, dissemination of information 
 Using both sides of the brain, and I ain't complacent 
 Complain when I speak, fuck Priority Records 
 Like Prince I'm writing "slave" on my cheek, cause my kids gotta eat 
 Meanwhile A&R's sniffing coke, getting kickbacks, fuck that 
 My written's like Christ wit a cross on his back 
 I breathe a total Black experience on a track 
 What use to be hot was what a emcee said 
 Now Hip-Hop don't respect you unless you platinum or dead 
 I'm Van Gogh, Van Gogh 
 But you don't hear me though 
 You're too near me not to hear me 
 Clearly, cut off my ear severely 
 Van Gogh, Van Gogh, Van Gogh (yeah) 
 But you don't hear me though 
 You're too near me not to hear me 
 Clearly, cut off my ear severely 
 I'm down wit Violet Brown and ebony cats 
 Down wit 65 niggas packing 70 gats 
 I'm down wit Shinehead, Big Gipp, Goodie M-O-B 
 My nigga Twista, Killah Priest, and Pimp C 
 From UGK, Do Or Die, AK 
 Qwest the Mad LaD, Wendy Day 
 I self lord am master art form, metaphors and furthermore 
 Verbal masterpiece to master war, then master more 
 Cause a real nigga known to flow rigor mortis to stiffen your riffing 
 Thugged out without Blooding or Cripping, till the needle start skipping 
 The cut fuck your hairline up like Scott Pippen 
 Huh, hoping the dummies stop fronting 
 I'm like Illmatic, meets the Good Will Hunting 
 Vocal innovator, be equal to or greater 
 Giving people levels to digest the data 
 Cause you can't teach algebra to first graders 
 I'll school a hustler, about the Sixteen Crucified Saviors 
 Chrishna of India was Black, Quexalcote of Mexico, Black 
 Buddha was Black, actual facts 
 But niggas only wanna know about money, pussy, and crack 
 I practiced building this strong rap track, and that's that 
 Phat rap, y'all keeping it real, well that's wack 
 My rap snap torso, and crack back 
 Doing this, that and the third 
 Giving you my ear like Van Gogh, nigga, ya heard 
 Went to New York state, pushing rhymes like weight 
 And watch some of these rap niggas hate (what in the homo) 
 But it's all love, Ice Cube did it, 2pac did it 
 And no matter what, I'ma die shitting, motherfucker 
 Josh Petell wrote *"The Disenchanted Hero&quot"* 
 Hell no 
 I'm Van Gogh, Van Gogh 
 But you don't hear me though 
 You're too near me not to hear me 
 Clearly, cut off my ear severely 
 Van Gogh, Van Gogh, Van Gogh 
 But you don't hear me though 
 You're too near me not to hear me 
 Clearly, cut off my ear severely 
 Van Gogh, Van Gogh (yeah) 
 Cause really though, how I'm supposed to really blow 
 When you drop a album every 2 years and only shoot one video? 
 (DJ Khalil) 
 Damn, Ras 
 (Ras Kass) 
 Man, Khalil, they ain't going never understand, but don't trip 
 These labels, these magazines, radio, video shows... 
 They just as groupie as the groupies 
 They just as guilty as the artists for not keeping this shit true 
 But hey, you gotta love it or leave it alone 
 An' I still love this ol' Hip-Hop shit 
 So just respect it when I get my championship ring, you know
