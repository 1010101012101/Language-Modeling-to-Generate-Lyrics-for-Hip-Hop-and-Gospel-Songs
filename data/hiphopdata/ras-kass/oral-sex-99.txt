 "Death on the phono, my skills are dolo 
 You say 'oh no', you bitch ass homo" 
 ---> ATCQ (Scenario remix) 
 Verse One: Ras Kass 
 I'ma kick it to y'all frankly 
 So all y'all weak niggaz can hate me 
 Jealous 'cause they know I'm the shit, like Mr. Hankey 
 Reintroducing Ras Kass, the waterproof 
 I'm too deep, you Too $hort 
 Standin' on two feet, drownin' in two feet, kapeesh? 
 I defy the feat by defecating on beat, fuck how you feel 
 I've got an oral fixation with spitting liquid razors 
 So ill that they cut through steel 
 So if my album ever sell 3 mil 
 I'm slashing every rapper with a deal 
 Every nigga with a video look like Seal 
 'Kiss From a Rose' - Not, more like a peck from Jada' 
 Even with a spectator 
 Ranked this nigga 45 in Blaze 50 greatest MCs 
 Good lookin' but I beg to differ, though 
 Body of evidence 
 My molecular structure based on the table of elements 
 I'm Cmx4, Nl3, Iv3, plus Tg2, Rd4, Ms4, Gr1, At5 (????!) 
 I'm complex with curriculums combinded 
 A next level innovator with invigorating rhymes 
 Plus slightly thuged out, but revolutionary with minds 
 Spit my message with grime 
 Five years ahead of my time 
 Two thousand and five, 
 I'ma be that nigga beatin' down traffic cops at stop signs 
 Put that in you're glass dick and smoke it 
 Who the dopest? if Ras spoke it, loc'est 
 The most focused wrote the opus, Nature of the Threat 
 Fost focus richest the bok'est could get it like 
 I'm sexually transmitted, bidditch 
 Yeah, yeah, Evil D make it ill for me, spit it

 "Death on the phono, my skills are dolo 
 You say 'oh no', you bitch ass homo" 
 Verse Two: Ras Kass 
 It's that underground b-boy shit 
 Just a beat and a rhyme 
 As simplified as a heat and a crime 
 True lyricists always get felt 
 'Cause I rarely masturbate dog, but I always be feelin' myself 
 I rep' Golden State Warriors, I rep' The Horsemen 
 Get pissy drunk and forced to break the porcelin 
 God, I'm worse than Cupid, stupid 
 Love is Lust, so my glands release hollow point endorphins 
 Bitch nigga, I'm mighty morphin' into a larson 
 Forcin' grown men into a forced a-dult abortion 
 Make it scorchin' 
 Hot to death then drop it artic 
 So MCs shatter like glass next time a nigga sparks shit 
 Make sense/cents, even if I don't make dollars 
 Asiatic ghetto scholar 
 Y'all grafted like seedless grapes and rottweilers 
 My hoochie bitches pop that pussy while my pimp niggaz pop they collars 
 And pop stars- these the last days of disco 
 It's all about me-me-me-me-me 
 'Cause I'm out here with a big dick, though 
 You faggot like Sisqo 
 You thumbs down six feet like Ebert and Gene Siskel 
 I'm blessed with my Father's complexion and my Mother's features 
 I'm unique, different from all other creatures 
 I be rocking a black doo rag tellin' pigeons youse a motherfuckin fool 
 And they be like 'you look like Ja Rule, but that's cool' 
 I guess all short, chocolate, chinky eyed niggaz look alike, boo 
 Let the pen stroke, so the track have a heart attack 
 You blind, baby, give your cataracts cataracts 
 Matter of fact, face it, I'm just not the norm 
 More graphic than porn 
 I'm like eye witnessin' a matador get his rib cage crushed 
 Lung pulled by a raging bull's horn 
 I put it on like a uniform 
 What?
