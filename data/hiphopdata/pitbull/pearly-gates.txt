Nayer 
 Baby Your All That I Want 
 Pitbull 
 I don't believe in religion, I believe in God, and baby you my heaven 
 Nayer 
 Baby Your All That I want, 
 When you lying here in my arms 
 I'm Finding it hard to believe, we're in heaven 
 Pitbull 
 She's my lady, my baby, my women and 
 She's hot as hell, yeah, 
 But she's my heaven 
 She is my Eve, 
 I'm her apple for example 
 We got that sinful passion, 
 We got that hot lust 
 We got that one in a million love 
 All of the above 
 Let them talk they envy, 
 I love them text's you send me 
 With a pic attached 
 Your girlfriend she friendly 
 You like a quarterback you'll go down in the sack 
 Our love is never ending, that's why they hate like that 
 Nayer 
 Baby Your All That I Want 
 When Your lying here in my arms 
 I'm finding it hard to believe, were in heaven 
 And Loving is all that I need 
 And it found it there in your heart 
 It isn't too hard to see 
 Were in heaven 
 Pitbull 
 She's my lady, my baby, my women and 
 She's there thick 'n' thin 
 She's there rain or fog 
 She's there whether I lose or win whether I rise or fall 
 She's with me wherever we live lavishly or in poverty 
 She loves me for me 
 Armando Perez not Mr. 3-oh-5 that's right 
 This life can be deceitful 
 And my career attracts, 
 All the wrong people 
 If you find a keeper 
 Then you better keep her 
 I always put her first, 
 Her love is heaven on Earth 
 Nayer 
 Baby your all that I want 
 When your lying here in my arms 
 I'm finding it hard to believe 
 Were in heaven 
 And Loving is all I need 
 And it found it there in your heart 
 It isn't too hard to see 
 Were in heaven 
 Baby your all that I want 
 When your lying here in my arms 
 I'm finding it hard to believe 
 We're in heaven 
 Love is all I need 
 And it found it there in your heart 
 It isn't too hard to see we're in heaven 
 Were in heaven
