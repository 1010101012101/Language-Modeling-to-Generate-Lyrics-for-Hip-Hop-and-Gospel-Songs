Toomp! 
 Que hola! 
 Esto para la gente que rapiando (?) y no sabe lo que estan hablando 
 They don't call me Mr. 3-0-5 for nothing. 
 I earned that shit! 
 Dale! 
 Whoooo ow! 
 I don't mess with the smack 
 I don't mess with the blow 
 I don't mess with the crack 
 Not me, no mo' 
 Wanna holla at a latin broad (Come see me!) 
 And if you try'na get that money, buddy (Come see me!) 
 Y'all can play, thugs and gangstas while I 
 Get this money with these lords and bankers 
 I was, watching Scarface dreaming of becoming Tony, 
 Schemin, Triple beamin, double teamin bitches with my homies 
 I got no blame its just some bitches understand my story 
 And anger problems, my brother, Uly wont hear before me 
 Rap had me, wanting to be a dope boy 
 Now I rap, I stay away from that dope, boy 
 It's destiny, I was breast fed that coke boy 
 And when you seem them chicos better call them folks boy 
 I'm putting y'all on the game 
 I'm hearing raps about coke and crack (crack?) 
 To be honest they all sound the same 
 Pit is off the chain (chain?) 
 Yeah, That's etched in stone (stone?) 
 So leave him alone (lone?) 
 Boy, leave him alone 
 Pit's reporting live (live!) 
 From D-A-D-E 
 Gotta problem buddy? 
 Come see me! 
 Fuck whos the baddest a person's status depends on salary 
 This for them Cuban's losing life over Fidel's mentality 
 Treat a hater like golf and put a hole in one 
 I don't carry guns but my dawg's holdin' one 
 Y'all boys flip bricks, These boys flip tons 
 One time Fat Joe, Rest In Peace Big Pun 
 This how I do it do it 
 Spit English and Spanish fluent 
 Then if you don't know I suggest 
 You pay close attention to it 
 Pit's here now 
 This how it's going down 
 Kilos and pounds 
 Goin' town to town 
 Fortunately that's not my life no mo' 
 If its gotta do with dope 
 For me it's a no go 
 Pit's one of a kind 
 Pit's ahead of his time 
 I'm nowhere near my prime 
 I'm always on the grind 
 I'm reporting live 
 From D-A-D-E 
 Gotta problem buddy? 
 Come see me! 
 Come see me! x4
