Mamita why we gotta keep going through this 
 Talk to her Frankie 
 Just Yesterday you said you loved me 
 That there was nobody else above me 
 That I was yours and you were mine 
 That there was no limits to our skies 
 But then you had to put our love on hold 
 When it came to making love it wasn't you anymore 
 And now your telling me to leave 
 I gotta walk out the door 
 Can't you see that this is killing me 
 Its hurting my soul 
 Oh baby 
 Frankie J & Ken Y 
 How am I supposed to leave you 
 When my heart tells me to keep you 
 How can you ask me to let you goooo 
 No I just can't let you go 
 No I just can't let you go 
 (No) 
 Can't you see I'm slowly dying 
 But I'm gonna keep on trying 
 Please don't ask of me to let you goooo 
 Pitbull 
 Let me start 
 By telling you I love you with all my heart 
 But I can't understand the reason 
 When you tell me your leaving 
 Girl me and you were suppose to be forever and ever 
 Now instead of being in love 
 It's like we are use to each other 
 How could we do this to each other 
 We use to ride for each other 
 Die for each other 
 Cry for each other 
 Now it's like all we wanna do is say is bye to each other 
 I can't let this happen 
 I refuse to lose you 
 I love you baby 
 It's the truth as usual 
 I wanna make you happy 
 Girl it ain't hard to see 
 You mean the world to me 
 We had been though it all 
 Thick or thin right or wrong 
 I can't let you go 'cause this love is too strong

 Look baby just tell me what you want 
 Look baby just tell me what you need 
 Look baby I know I'm far from perfect 
 But the game and the money they can take cause its worthless 
 I know its hard to deal with my life 
 I know its hard to deal with all the gossip 
 I done seen 'em wit this one 
 I done seen 'em wit that one 
 But everything they say is monotonous 
 Can't you hear it in my voice 
 Mami you know you're my heart my soul my love 
 And I swear to you baby 
 I just want to give you my heart my soul my love 
 I know we can work this out 
 I know we can 
 Baby lets try 
 But one thing I won't do is let this love die 
 (Is let this love die)
