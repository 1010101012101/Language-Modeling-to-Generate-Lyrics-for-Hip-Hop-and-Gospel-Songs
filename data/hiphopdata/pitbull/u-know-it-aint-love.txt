(Pitbull) 
 Love to hate me 
 I love that you hate me greatly 
 I appreciate your love 
 (Rj) 
 If you want me now 
 Celebrate the love that we have inside 
 Like a full moon rise 
 Right here into my arms 
 Every day I feel I can live or die 
 If you realize 
 When you walk right out my life 
 I don't wanna lose the fight 
 But I can't seem to forget you 
 Even though we're through 
 You know it ain't love, whoa oh oh 
 Why am I lost without your touch 
 You know it ain't love, whoa oh oh 
 Cause this feeling is too much 
 You know it ain't love 
 (Pitbull) 
 Uh, yeah 
 Mammi raps right 
 So I pulled out my dick and told her to 
 Speak into the mic 
 You love me, you hate me 
 Those that love to hate me 
 I love that you hate me greatly 
 I appreciate your love 
 Y'all can throw me in blender for talking shit 
 (Rj) 
 You know it ain't love 
 You know it ain't love 
 'Cause when you open up inside 
 I can't keep you from my eyes 
 You know it ain't love 
 (Pitbull) 
 I've been politically incorrect since the day I was born 
 That's why till the day that I die it's on... 
 I'ma fight for the cause 
 When the pitt bites, you know what happens to the jaw 
 Fuck around and it might be your 
 Big l, big pun, big 
 (Rj) 
 Why are you so bad 
 This means a heart that burns the fire 
 Can make us higher 
 You just make me feel sad 
 This was the best thing I could ever have 
 That's the word you said 
 I was wrong I did not tell you 
 When I needed you 
 Set me free, why me 
 But I can't seem to stop dreaming with all these demons 
 You know it ain't love, whoa oh oh 
 Why am I lost without your touch 
 You know it ain't love, whoa oh oh 
 Cause this feeling is too much 
 You know it ain't... know it ain't... 
 You know it ain't love 
 (Pitbull) 
 Chances are one in a million 
 I hear you died in a plane crash 
 So I guess that makes her one in a million 
 May you rest in peace 
 But that's your job 
 Destiny is somethin' that you just can't cheat 
 If you're destined to die, it's just your time, live with it 
 I don't think y'all got that line 
 (Rj) 
 You know it ain't love 
 No baby 
 You know it ain't love 
 'Cause when you open up inside 
 I can't keep you from my eyes 
 You know it ain't love, yeah 
 You know it ain't love 
 Said, you know it ain't love, baby 
 Don't tell me, when you know, when you know 
 You know it ain't love
