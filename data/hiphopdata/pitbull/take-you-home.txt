(Feat. Oobie) 
 Everytime I see you, you're trying to take me home 
 And it makes me wonder, if we were to get it on 
 Would you take the time to touch me... (touch me) 
 And take me in to extacy yeah 
 And I wonder if I take you home 
 Would you give me your love baby 
 Would you fulfill my fantasys 
 Or would you just do me wrong (would you just do me wrong) 
 Mami what's up with you 
 I just wanna get to know you better 
 Mami you tight word 
 And I know I can get you wetter 
 I know you hear this a lot 
 And I know you fed up 
 I know life is hard, but you gotta keep your head up 
 You got the real game... ccheck 
 Nail game... ccheck 
 Hair game... ccheck 
 Everything... ccheck 
 That's why I can't wait to slip off your clothes and lick you from head to toe 
 And give you some of this fine head till you explodeee 
 I wanna make you cum till you can cum no mo' 
 I wanna see you girl, roll your toess 
 I wanna be the one to turn you out 
 Ima show you what I be about 
 I'm not a hot boy, ima hot man 
 That'll eat yo ass, till you say god damn 
 Girl I love this 
 And if you think you got some undefeated tyson pussy, bitch I'm buster douglas 
 And I wonder if I take you home 
 Would you give me your love baby 
 Would you fulfill my fantasys 
 Or would you just do me wrong (would you just do me wrong) 
 I wanna be that man, that you've... never had before 
 I wanna be that man, that'll put it on you fast and slow 
 I wanna be, everything that you need baby and more 
 It would be no fun, if I told you everything that's in store 
 You've got those body parts, I just wanna explore 
 Coma with me loco, ven paca mi amor... 
 You got my two boys, below my waistline, singing the blues 
 Tell me baby, honestly, what is it exactly you got to losee 
 Nothing there's always some time in the wall* 
 And now you know you want some moree 
 Ima have you going crazy, praising the lordd 
 I fuck like I rap, hardcore 
 I'm not a hot boy, ima hot man 
 That'll eat yo ass, till you say god damn 
 Girl I love this 
 And if you think you got some undefeated tyson pussy, bitch I'm buster douglas 
 And I wonder if I take you home 
 Would you give me your love baby 
 Would you fulfill my fantasys 
 Or would you just do me wrong (would you just do me wrong)
