Talking Intro: Pitbull 
 Me not working hard? 
 Yeah right, picture that with a Kodak 
 Or better yet, go to Times Square 
 Take a picture of me with a Kodak 
 Took my life from negative to positive 
 I just want y'all to know that 
 And tonight lets enjoy life 
 Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo, that's right! 
 Ne-Yo 
 Tonight, I want all of you tonight 
 Give me everything tonight 
 For all we know, we might not get tomorrow 
 Let's do it tonight 
 Nayer 
 Don't care what they say 
 Or what games they play 
 Nothing is enough 
 Till they handle love (let's do it tonight) 
 I want you tonight 
 I want you to stay 
 I want you tonight 
 Ne-Yo 
 Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em HEY 
 Give me everything tonight 
 Give me everything tonight 
 Give me everything tonight 
 Give me everything tonight 
 Pitbull rap 
 Take advantage of tonight 
 'Cause tomorrow I'm off to Dubai to perform for a princess 
 But tonight, I can make you my queen and make love to you endless 
 Its insane the way the name growin', money keep flowin 
 Hustla's move in silence so I'm tip-toein' 
 To keep blowin' 
 I got it locked up like Lindsey Lohan 
 Put it on my life baby 
 I'll make you feel right baby 
 Can't promise tomorrow, but I'll promise tonight 
 Dale! 
 Pitbull sing 
 Excuse me, and I might drink a little more than I should 
 Tonight 
 And I might take you home with me if I could 
 Tonight 
 And baby Imma make you feel so good 
 Tonight 
 'Cause we might not get tomorrow

 Reach for the stars 
 And if you don't grab 'em 
 At least you'll fall on top of the world 
 Think about it 
 'Cause if you slip I'm gon' fall on top of your girl (HAHA) 
 What I'm involved in, is deeper than the Mason's 
 Baby baby, and it ain't no secret 
 My family's from Cuba 
 But I'm an American and I don't get money like Seacrest 
 Put it on my life baby 
 I'll make you feel right baby 
 Can't promise tomorrow 
 But I'll promise tonight
