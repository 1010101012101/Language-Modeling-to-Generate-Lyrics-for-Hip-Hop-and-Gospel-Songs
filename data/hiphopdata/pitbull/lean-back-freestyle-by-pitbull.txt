I'm that maimi boy, maimi raised 
 Young cuban 
 They got them old-school maimi ways run up on them with them K's 
 Llama lo dominicanos, tell'em that we got that haze 
 And we got them chevys, with them westie stops we call'em blaze 
 All my niggas holiday, everydays a holiday 
 We give you shells a presents buddy that's how you get sprayed 
 FUCK 
 What you niggas say duh 
 When you hear the K run 
 Nigga get away, hide when you see my face 
 Pity say just in the league of his own all you fools trying to catch up and do what he does might as well leave him alone 
 I can't wait till my nigga damey come home 
 Till then I'ma keep fighting to be the youngest one holding the throne

 But do me a favor MOTHERFUCKER LEAN BACK!
