[Pitbull]: 
 She walks so cold 
 But her ass on fire x4 
 [Lmfao]: 
 And I said uh 
 You are like the type of girl I like 
 And I said uh

 [Pitbull]: 
 I said hold on 
 And it won't take long 
 Baby put this put this put this 
 Rubber on! x2 
 They said that chico there on fire boy 
 And that's the truth 
 That chico get nasty that chico get wild 
 Boy that chico get's loose 
 He spits off flames, fuego 
 Reps this town up 
 Baby come and get this huevo 
 Y'all can stay on goose 
 I stay on ghetto 
 Llama a los bomberos, hello 
 When I flip it, I rip it 
 I'm on fire 
 What's up this ???? I swear it just flies 
 But baby forget about that 
 I just wanna hit it 
 From the front and the back 
 I won't go for McCain 
 'Cause of his wife president 
 She's a little off the chain 
 Her 
 Five kids 
 She must love to fuck 
 And like a square 
 I'mma save her nuts (HA!)

 You are like the type of girl I like 
 And I said uh 
 I might doble up tonight (oh yeah) 
 [Pitbull]: 
 I said hold on 
 And it won't take long 
 Baby put this put this put this 
 Rubber on! x2
