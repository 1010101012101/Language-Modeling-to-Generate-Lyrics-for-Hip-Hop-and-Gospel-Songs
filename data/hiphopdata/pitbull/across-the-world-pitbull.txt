Uh uh uh uh uh uh 
 Uh uh uh uh uh uh 
 Oh Oh 
 I got up today 
 And my flight was late 
 On my way to L.A 
 I jumped up on a plane 
 And put on my shades 
 And threw on my head phones 
 I was vibing to this beat 
 That made me move my feet 
 Boy that thang? was sticky 
 And then I heard this (melody) 
 The dopest one I've ever seen 
 Something out the usual 
 So Mr. Pilot please 
 I think I got a hit on you 
 Hurry to the studio. 
 I'll play across the world 
 (Across the world) 
 Across the world 
 I'll play across the world 
 (Across the world) 
 Across the world 
 I'll play across the world 
 Uh uh uh uh uh uh 
 Uh uh uh uh uh uh 
 Ooh Oh 
 Well I got up today 
 Put some gas in my tank 
 To make it to the studio 
 And then I heard this beat 
 It made me move my feet 
 Hell yeah that thing was super dope 
 And then I sang this (melody) 
 The dopest one I've ever seen 
 Something out the usual 
 So Mr. Engineer 
 Turn up the idol tone 
 So I'll be on the radio 
 I'll play across the world 
 (Across the world) 
 Across the world 
 I'll play across the world 
 (Across the world) 
 Across the world 
 I'll play across the world 
 Uh uh uh uh uh uh 
 Uh uh uh uh uh uh 
 Ooh Oh 
 Been around the world 
 Same old songs 
 Now on stage 
 You have raws and thongs 
 Long way from what I came from 
 Fighting in the club 
 For just singing a song 
 Now my passports full 
 I'm outta pages 
 New places, new faces 
 New fans, all ages 
 Black, pink, purple, orange, 
 Caucasians 
 Now then those European and 
 Asian, Anabaenas? 
 Knew all my lyrics, it was Amazing! 
 They spoke Spanish 
 I guess its true what they say 
 Music is the universal language 
 It's a true blessing you know 
 I'll play across the world 
 (Across the world) 
 Across the world 
 I'll play across the world 
 (Across the world) 
 Across the world 
 I'll play across the world
