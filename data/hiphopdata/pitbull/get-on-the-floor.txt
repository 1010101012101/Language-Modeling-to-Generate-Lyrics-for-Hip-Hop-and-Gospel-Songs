(Chorus repeat 2x) 
 Oh 
 Girl you better (oh) 
 St-Stop playin' (oh) 
 Bitch what'cha waitin for 
 Get your ass on the floor 
 You know the night was good 
 When you wake up in the morning 
 With a cloudy piss 
 You know how I do 
 Gimme the vodka skip the cris 
 I'm at the bar feelin' like 50 takin' like 9 shots 
 I got like 9 broads takin' 'em with me why stop 
 Now I'm bouncin' from broad to broad 
 This thing is thick from wall to wall 
 I've never read the book 
 But it's like I mastered the art of war 
 So if anybody thinks they can take advantage 
 'Cause I've had a couple of drinks think again 
 Ill have you like kanye west 
 With a brand new jaw and a metal chin 
 (Chorus rp 2x) 
 Excuse me I'm takin' over 
 I'm sick like ebola 
 I don't know what they told ya 
 But bitch this chico's a soldier 
 Get the crip and roll up 
 Or drop the E and roll out 
 Most of these busta's fold up 
 When its time to thug out 
 Imma take it to the club 
 Where them freaks be takin' it off and backin it up 
 Imma make ya so hot as soon as these mami's walk in they ready to fuck 
 Every (every) body (body) listen (listen) closely 
 'Cause imma do what's never been done 
 The games been fucked but it's never been sprung 
 (Chorus rp 2x) 
 Oh Oh Oh 
 Get your ass on the floor 
 Oh Oh 
 Get your ass on the floor 
 Oh Oh 
 Get your ass on the floor 
 Oh Oh Oh 
 Get your ass on the floor 
 Oh 
 Girl 
 Oh 
 St-Stop playin' (oh) 
 Bitch what'cha waitin for 
 Get your ass on the floor (rp 2x)
