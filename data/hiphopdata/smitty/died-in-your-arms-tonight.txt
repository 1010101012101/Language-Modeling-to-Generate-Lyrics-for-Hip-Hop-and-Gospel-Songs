(Feat. Robin Thicke) 
 Oh, I just died in your arms tonight 
 It mustve been somethin' you said 
 I just died in your arms tonight 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 New money, white forces 
 New money, white porches 
 Blue money, like bosses 
 White frames aiming Scott Storches 
 Gold bottles hit the boards (?) wit, 
 Top models and their gorgeous. 
 Look, heres a pen 
 Call me round 10 
 Ask him, I'm the man girlfriend 
 She's hot, and I got her 
 No trot, dun dot 'er 
 Don't stop, mo' dollars 
 20 on the watch 
 Who you know do it holler 
 I talk it 
 I live it 
 I do it the best 
 She on the right, and you on the left 
 Movin yo body till you outta breath 
 Keep doin' what you doin' to def 
 2 step like 
 Oh, I just died in your arms tonight 
 It mustve been somethin' you said 
 I just died in your arms tonight 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 I was on cris 
 She was on E 
 I was her, she was on me 
 In the club drunk singin' off key like 
 "Oh oh oh oh" 
 Damn it feel good to see niggas up on it 
 Got 2 coupes new, 
 Didn't flaunt it 
 Old work, new stashes 
 Old work, in the plastic 
 Money first, that's classic 
 Ain't a thang, got the whip game masta'd 
 She stops 
 I spot her 
 Blue top 
 Boots prada 
 I get it 
 I got it 
 I had her before 
 Makin' this money is all that I know 
 Movin yo body get back on the floo 
 Keep doin' what you doin' somemo 
 Lets go like oh 
 Oh, I just died in your arms tonight 
 It must've been somethin' you said 
 I just died in your arms tonight 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 The way you walk, the way you move 
 The way you talk, the way you move 
 On my grind I can't lose 
 'Cause I am so cool 
 The way you look, the way you stand 
 The way you said what you said 
 Can't help it it's the way I am 
 'Cause I am so cool 
 Oh, I just died in your arms tonight 
 It must've been somethin' you said 
 I just died in your arms tonight 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh
