To my niggas in the 2-1-2 and 3-1-0 
 Bitches in the 3-0-5 and 4-0-4 
 Niggas in the 7-1-3 and 2-0-1, 3-1-2, call 9-1-1 
 It's Sticky Fingaz licken off in hip-hop {*repeat 3X*} 
 Every rhyme I kick is a gunshot 
 (Verse One) 
 My heart bleed for you, so don't waste your tears 
 I'm about 175 in dog years 
 My blocks so hot step outside and get sunburned 
 Unless you talking business or money I'm un-con-cerned 
 I live for now 'cause my days is numbered 
 Got a six shot revolver watch the barrel on my gun turn 
 I'm like a accident just waitin' to happen 
 It's pitiful this game is too political critical 
 A nigga front, my killa's in the cut waitin' to clap 'em 
 But let's not talk about the big I's and the little U's 
 Niggas wouldn't be confused if they mind their p's and q's 
 Keep your nose out of mine and I won't have to squeeze the two's 
 Everybody know Sticky be puttin' down 
 And cock the glock, what's that sound? 
 So watch out watch out, niggas better clear a path 
 Think I'm scared to blast 'cause I'm doing flicks on Miramax 
 And New Line fuck security, my bodyguard is my two nines 
 Knew I'd make it big in due time 
 My only lie when my lips move 
 Until I smell 'em for myself I don't believe shit stink 
 Gun in my crotch my forth leg is a pistol; who wanna get shot? 
 And all these whack rappers want deals but no can do 
 Robbing niggas for everything but the kitchen sink 
 Labels be like "Don't call us, we'll call you!" 
 [Chorus] - repeat 2X 
 (Verse Two) 
 And strippin niggas and still gettin' figures 
 Back in the day Sticky was stickin' niggas 
 And pistol whippin niggas and flippin niggas 
 Now wonder if this life fit us in Vegas with strippin white bitches 
 I ran with life bidders and ice pickers 
 I'm Black Trash true to the streets gritty and grime 
 But that's just a deep thought in the back of my mind 
 I got a bone to pick a holster with a shoulder grip 
 Concealed inside my leather camouflage so watch ya eye don't notice it 
 Don't tell nobody, but 'tween me and you I'll put three in you 
 You want the job done right you gotta do it yourself 
 I got blueprints of ya death and I drew it myself 
 Add you and ya crew to the M-E-N-U 
 My code defending my conscience, my mind inflictedwith monsters 
 Yo breath stank that's 'cause you be talkin' A TON OF SHIT! 
 Kill a nigga over nonsense for five cents 
 You a glutton for punishment, I'm the nigga runnin' shit 
 Killers in front of ya house forget aboooout it 
 You can't take me out forget aboooout it 
 I'll bring it to your front door and you won't do shit aboooout it 
 Y'all niggas don't want no war forget aboooout it 
 You dead if you harm a single hair on my head 
 You need work come see me son I'm taking applications 
 Can't beat me join me save yourself the aggravation 
 My payback is going to cost you a arm and a leg 
 [Chorus] - repeat 2X 
 Ooh... 
 You can run but you can hide 
 When I come it's do or die 
 Point your guns to the sky 
 Put 'em up real high
