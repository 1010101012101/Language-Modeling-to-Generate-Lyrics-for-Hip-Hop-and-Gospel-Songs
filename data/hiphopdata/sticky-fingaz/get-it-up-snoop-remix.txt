 I think it's bout' time for me hit these, 
 Niggas upsite in here, 
 The head wit some west coast gansta shit 
 Oh... Wee... 
 (OhhWee) 
 (Sticky Fingaz) 
 Hennesied up, play the cut lighting it up 
 Rag on my head, eyes lookin' half way dead 
 Brought my thugs to the club, straight off the street 
 I'm iceburg to my feet about a third of the week 
 Relax baby don't spazz 'cause he touched your ass 
 I ain't say shit when your friend touched my dick 
 I see Brooklyn schemin, we all in the spot 
 But that's hip hop, we rap niggaz from off the block 
 Is it me or is it gettin' hot in here 
 I think somebody bout to get shot in here 
 The nine mill guaranteed to clear the spot in here 
 And we ain't get searched kid, we got glocks in here 
 Someone bring me to the hoe suckin cocks in here 
 I think they trying to shut it down, I seen cops in here 
 I'm the hottest shit Universal got this year 
 And all my niggaz rockin' rocks in here, come on 
 Get it up, huh 
 The ice on ya wrist player pick it up, huh 
 My killers in the cut coast stick 'em up, huh 
 Ladies grab your shirts and lift 'em up, huh 
 Say Snoop upsite yo' head, say Snoop upsite yo' head 
 (Say what) 
 Say Snoop upsite yo' head, say Snoop upsite yo' head 
 (Ride On) 
 Say Snoop upsite yo' head, say Snoop upsite yo' head

 (Jay-Z) 
 I flex the rol', sign a check for yo' hoe 
 Jigga's style is love, X and O 
 Save all your accolades, just the dough 
 My game is wide, all lames aside 
 Tryin' to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet 
 Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain ya eye 
 Twin platinum gun son, aim for the sky 
 Ice on my bullet, you die soon as I pull it 
 Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young 
 See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up 
 Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub' 
 Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up 
 Multi till I close up, it's all basic 
 I been spending hundreds since they had small faces 
 Rob your stash house, doubled out down in Vegas 
 Me and Jermaine Dupri got it locked crazy 
 Where you at haters? 
 (Snoop Dogg) 
 Snoop D O double G, L B C, baby boy we rock the party 
 Snoop D O double G, L B C, baby girl we rock the party 
 Snoop D O double G, L B C, baby boy we rock the party 
 Snoop D O double G, L B C, baby girl we rock the party 
 (Sticky Fingaz) 
 I'm so hot to death 
 I'll probably get shot to death 
 Fuck who the cops arrest 
 My killers is rough, shoot up the club like Puff 
 Niggaz'll duck, chains tucked, Timbs get scuffed 
 I pull a four-four from out of the seat 
 Up out it and beat 
 Picture me not riding with heat 
 Jump out of the Jeep 
 Clear a nigga out of the street 
 Nobody can creep 
 Thirty deep nigga, I'm out of your reach 
 Ain't nothing but killers boasting next to me 
 I'm prejuduce, I hate every color except for green 
 In the club, that's were my niggaz jwewlry shop 
 When the hammer cock, we don't care who we box 
 So why you come to the club, what you livin' it up 
 Why you fuckin' with that chicken, was she givin' it up 
 Why you even cop jewels, what you can't get stuck 
 Why you never say when, you ain't had enough 
 Get it up, huh 
 The ice on ya wrist player pick it up, huh 
 My killers in the cut coast stick 'em up, huh 
 Ladies grab your shirts and lift 'em up, huh
