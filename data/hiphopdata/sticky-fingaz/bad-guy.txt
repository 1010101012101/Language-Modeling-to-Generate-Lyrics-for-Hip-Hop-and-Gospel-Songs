I learned at a early age what's important in life 
 It's a game, bet your money, don't get caught in that dice 
 I had tony montana dreams of takin' over 
 Getting rich mixing yae, wit dat baking soda 
 There's 3 options get money, death or jail 
 Fuck college, my career wuz right there in those scales 
 Never personal, nah I'm a businessman 
 Cut off a nigga hand he come up short on a gram 
 Put your money where your mouth iz, ill take yo chips 
 'Cause if don't make dollars, den it don't make sense 
 Ask any nigga dat did dirt wit da god 
 I used to work hard, robbing niggaz dat work hard 
 So if you're slanging keys 
 Or slanging cds 
 The more you sell, the more jealousy you're gonna see 
 I'm olny good at doing drugs, sports and entertainment 
 That's what I told the judge in court at my arainment 
 I sold everything from crack, to guns, to weed 
 Keep the heat between my boxers and my dongeries 
 The whole business ran off supply and demand 
 Wit dis I had a whole hood inside my hand 
 Just taste it, swear your tongue be numb for a week 
 But try to jerk it, swear yo azz be unda the sheet 
 Keep flipping it raw, keep sellin that weight 
 Till they, kick in the door, it's the American way 
 Organized crime, infratated the force 
 We above the law, that's 'cause we paying 'em off 
 Gave my debt to society, but where's my change 
 For when I went in, I came out worse or even the same 
 It's the game of life 
 Been like dis since the beginning 
 Who could get the most cars, collect the best women 
 You can't judge nobody 'cause it's all essence 
 Whoever die wit the most money in the end when 
 If nothin' good is wrong then I don't want to be right 
 And if we got to knock a block or two then that's just fine 
 Call me the bad guy (the bad guy) 
 I got to have mine (got to have mine) 
 If nothin' good is wrong I don't wanna be right
