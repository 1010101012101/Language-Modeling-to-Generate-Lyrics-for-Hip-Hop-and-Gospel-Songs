Come here girl {*laughter*} 
 No more stunts no more lies 
 No more bitches in my ride 
 No more allnight parties I leave it behind 
 No more freaks live and try 
 No more drama in the life 
 From now on it's me and my lady just me and my baby 
 (Sticky Fingaz) 
 It starts going on tour the first time 
 Imagine the thoughts going threw a young rappers mind 
 Knowing you're mine and couldn't give a fuck if you leaved 
 Things I did its hard for my self to believe 
 Now that I'm sitting back thinking about smoking these trees 
 Girl you right I damn near ruined your life 
 The only one that was there at the end of the night 
 My vision was wrong, guess what my bitches is gone 
 And you don't want me now, that's why I'm flipping this song 
 Ignoring my calls dayly, fuck is you trying to scare me? 
 Talking to your machine you acting like you don't hear me 
 Thuggin' it out to much I think it's a wrap 
 Sending you gifts but god damn you sending them back 
 Killing myself like I ain't got know prize 
 Seeing your your face every time I close my eyes 
 Damn girl don't let this be the end of the ride 
 (Sticky Fingaz) 
 I've been around the world and seen the best of woman 
 Bitches loving my style I guess it's the thug in them 
 I'm just living my life with no time to talk to them 
 Tired of dissing my wife 'cause niggaz we all do it 
 Hoes calling my cell you cursing about crazy 
 Got to know that you hate me probably ready to snake me 
 Like pulling up to the club one night 
 In my benz with your friends and about to get right 
 Them birds they got nerve filling my mouth with words 
 Telling you that I don't car all night they in ya ear 
 Fuck wat am I suppose to do I'm miles away from home 
 Heard in your voice your feelings over the phone 
 Them nights we had fights I tried to keep it calm 
 Throwing my shit outside on the front lawn 
 I ain't want when I had you now I need you that you're gone (damn girl) 
 Just me and my lady 
 Just me and my baby
