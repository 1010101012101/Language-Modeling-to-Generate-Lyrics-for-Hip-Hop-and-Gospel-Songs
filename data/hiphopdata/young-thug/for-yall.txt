Young Thug 
 Ahem, I said, you don't wanna walk a mile in my jeans 
 Oh no, no 
 I get that green asparagus, bust it down with the team 
 And we go shopping all day 
 Whatever, won't you cop it all day 
 Need like 40 more credentials for the ladies 
 All that hatred got 'em sittin' outside for ages 
 '90s baby, feel like I been gettin' it since the '80s 
 Make sure everybody flossing, babe I'm saucy 
 My Hublot blue and I make air plays on Slauson 
 Aye, I'm makin' big ol' plays 
 Stackin' that Frito-Lay, just for my baby 
 Having racks on racks on racks, I'm goin' crazy 
 Flippin' these packs, these packs, bust it down buy a whip, Miss Daisy 
 Bust it down good, then get a [?] 
 Now take off, we don't play it 
 I didn't write this all, I just went right in 
 I dropped the Vet off and came back racin' 
 She down with me, got gone face it 
 She sucked me to sleep, I can't replace it 
 Creepin', man stop, never get over me 
 Used me for steppin' stones, just know you owe me 
 Everything Gwaluh, he ain't get no leak 
 I fuck around smoke your partner, on your lil ho street 
 Pussy never not wet, never got you upset 
 Patty cake when that check hit 
 For the fam it's Russian roulettes 
 On the private jet countin' bitches 
 Red light, I'm drinkin' red 
 Take care of everybody 'round me 
 And I live my life at risk 
 And I never forget to 
 Make sure everybody flossing, babe I'm saucy 
 My Hublot blue and I make air plays on Slauson 
 Aye, I'm makin' big ol' plays 
 Stackin' that Frito-Lay, just for my baby 
 I did everything for y'all to ball 
 Tell y'all risked it all to see a smile on y'all 
 I risked my future goals for all y'all 
 I risked my life she told me take that condom off and go raw 
 She perfect in my eyes, she know when I act modest 
 Girl version of me, man this just works for me 
 She, she genius, she my idol believe 
 Yah, and y'all need any sneakin' she gon' peep it 
 I want pics from that bitch she smokin' cigarettes 
 I got roaches for my daughter no puttin' back 
 Screamin' rest in peace to my partner off of Old Nat 
 Pussy never not wet, never got you upset 
 Patty cake when that check hit 
 For the fam it's Russian roulettes 
 On the private jet countin' Benji's 
 Red light, I'm drinkin' red 
 Take care of everybody 'round me 
 And I live my life at risk 
 And I never forget to 
 Make sure everybody flossing, babe I'm saucy 
 My Hublot blue and I make air plays on Slauson 
 Aye, I'm makin' big ol' plays 
 Stackin' that Frito-Lay, just for my baby 
 Jacquees 
 My baby 
 That's my baby 
 Do anything for my baby 
 Go crazy for my baby
