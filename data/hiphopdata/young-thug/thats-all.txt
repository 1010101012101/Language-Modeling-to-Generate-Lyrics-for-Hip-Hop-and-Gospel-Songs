I got me a K in this place 
 Baby, don't play in this place 
 You can call me ace in this place 
 Ten thousand dollar vase in his face 
 Bring them racks out the safe 
 Go to church like Mase 
 Put a mask on my face 
 Beat the case and buy a case and he dead 
 Fuck a nigga bitch, that's all 
 Grabbin' on my dick, that's all 
 Stuntin' with my bitch, that's all 
 Grindin' with my clique, that's all 
 My cup gotta be muddy, that's all 
 She tell me that she love me, that's all 
 I wanna clean it with Lysol (fresh) 
 She fuckin' all my buddies, that's all 
 She fuckin' all my buddies 
 I might love fuckin' it, But I just cannot love it 
 I might catch a nigga, bitch and fuck her right I crush her 
 Bitch, I am a monster, I know I am a lil' ugly 
 I might pull up with all of my jewelry on my bus 
 Got a unique body, my clothes, get 'em from Russia 
 I might pull up and pimp that bitch just like a sucka 
 I don't give a fuck about these lil shrimps, I got my mustard, ketchup, nigga 
 Nigga loaded pimpin' pill tight, game right 
 I might eat it, I might beat it like Mike Ikes 
 Treat that pussy Tempurpedic, and call it a night 
 She compliment on my fly, and I ain't talking no flight 
 And therefore I love her 
 She make a nigga shine without using butter 
 My partner in crime, she won't tell like her mother 
 We don't want no one other, we got one another 
 She know I got her we got each other 
 She know I'ma grip her V when I fuck her 
 She know I'ma go over c's like a Blood 
 Hey baby my name Jeff and Mud 
 I got me a K in this place 
 Baby, don't play in this place 
 You can call me ace in this place 
 Ten thousand dollar vase in his face 
 Bring them racks out the safe 
 Go to church like Mase 
 Put a mask on my face 
 Beat the case and buy a case and he dead 
 Fuck a nigga bitch, that's all 
 Grabbin' on my dick, that's all 
 Stuntin' with my bitch, that's all 
 Grindin' with my clique, that's all 
 My cup gotta be muddy, that's all 
 She tell me that she love me, that's all 
 I wanna clean it with Lysol (fresh) 
 She fuckin' all my buddies, that's all 
 I won't hit that girl, no guacamole 
 I can see straight through you like a bullet 
 Shawty want my closet like a hood 
 Fuck all of my feelings, no good 
 Bitch I am a tiger, no wood 
 I done see more hoes than Tiger Woods 
 When she with me she just do it 
 She can't fit into these jeans don't do it 
 She remember me 
 She remember everything about me 
 She remember me 
 She remember, she remember everything 
 She remember me 
 She remember me 
 She do it, she do, she do 
 She remember I'm a young nigga 
 Every time she see those racks she wants her some nigga 
 She know I'm in her mouth just like some gum, nigga 
 I might give her my all, then some, nigga 
 I'm strapped my fingers itchin' check my palms, nigga 
 My girl gon' relax, and dressed in Toms, nigga 
 I got Lil' Bobby I am a tall nigga 
 You know my cup is pink, like bubblegum, nigga 
 Pink, pussy wetter than a sink 
 Out here on my knees 
 If I can't have you you're deceased 
 That means I couldn't be 
 Baby, I can't see, curiosity 
 In love with the opposite of me 
 Do you dig it? 
 Fuck a nigga bitch, that's all 
 Grabbin' on my dick, that's all 
 Stuntin' with my bitch, that's all 
 Grindin' with my clique, that's all 
 My cup gotta be muddy, that's all 
 She tell me that she love me, that's all 
 I wanna clean it with Lysol (fresh) 
 She fuckin' all my buddies, that's all
