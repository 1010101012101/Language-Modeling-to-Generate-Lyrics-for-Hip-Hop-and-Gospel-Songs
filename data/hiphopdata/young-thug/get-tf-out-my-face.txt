 Way before the clubbing 
 Now I got my sack right, nigga 
 Still in the trap house kitchen 
 Let some of money come up missing 
 Fuck around, slap the shit out of all these niggas

 If it's off my hip I'mma pull that motherfucker back just like a sling shot 
 And you ain't hold your homie down like you suppose to
