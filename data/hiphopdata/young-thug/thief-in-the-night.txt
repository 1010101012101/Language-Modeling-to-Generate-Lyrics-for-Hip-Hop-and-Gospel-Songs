I wake up and go get me some new money 
 You know I'm living like a G 
 These lil niggas ain't gonna take nothin' from me 
 You know we do it like a G 
 I swear to God I fuck on anyone 
 Just like a gangsta, just like a G 
 This Duct Tape and YSL 
 You know I do it like a G 
 G's up hoes down 
 G's up hoes down 
 G's up hoes down 
 G's up hoes down 
 G's up hoes down 
 G's up hoes down 
 G's up hoes down 
 G's up hoes down 
 Like a thief in the night 
 I take anything but some pussy 
 Suck that head like a dyke 
 She got that head that I like 
 Deep in your partner ain't right 
 Put that lil babe on ice 
 I make the paper like rice 
 Head on that bucket, your mothafuckin' life, Skoob 
 I promise you don't know me 
 I pull up bout my cake 
 Where I'm from is not safe 
 I got fish, I'm a lake 
 Scoop them grits on a plate 
 Yet she thought it was steak 
 I'm a thief in the night 
 Make her ride like a bike 
 I go down on a dyke, I go up on my price 
 I might chop Kimbo Slice, kidnap like Uncle Ice 
 I got grits at the beach and they white like a rice 
 Let Trouble take your life 
 After I give you five 
 Scraping that five to the side 
 It ain't no question how nigga gon' ride 
 When they come with them questions 
 My nigga get quiet, sh sh, nigga sit quiet, sh sh 
 I am not taking no disrespect 
 You Patrick Ewing, you pump fakin' 
 No that won't happen on me 
 I drop a key like the mafuckin' beat 
 I look good as your dad on a Friday 
 So many cars I gotta buy a driveway 
 Never gon' let 'em live a nigga crime day 
 Serving these S and P's, I'm steady poppin' 
 Pockets fat up like they jumped 'em 
 YSL, that slimy anaconda 
 Bicking back, being bool like a uncle 
 I'm so geeked up I might fuck a condom 
 Like a thief in the night 
 I take anything but some pussy 
 Suck that head like a dyke 
 She got that head that I like 
 Deep in your partner ain't right 
 Put that lil babe on ice 
 I make the paper like rice 
 Head on that bucket, your mothafuckin' life, Skoob 
 I promise you don't know me 
 I pull up bout my cake 
 Where I'm from is not safe 
 I got fish, I'm a lake 
 Scoop them grits on a plate 
 Yet she thought it was steak 
 I'm a thief in the night 
 Make her ride like a bike 
 I get 'em all on a race 
 She didn't even know what it was but she taste it 
 I dig in, her shit sound like Jason 
 I be on Percocets more than occasion 
 They betting on me like in Vegas 
 Betting on me like I'm Vegas 
 Stick to the code man, there won't be no traitor 
 Thugga Thugga, tell me what you would say 
 What would you say? 
 No J Money, but my gun say, "Bow" 
 Pop a molly, look at her then fiend 
 I'm the target mofucka, no beam 
 No this shit is not good as it seems 
 I might give her the boots with no jeans 
 I kick shit like a chong and a ching 
 I'm a boss, I'm bout that unity 
 Sandwiches, you know you in between 
 And you gotta know we at the green 
 You gotta be young nigga, wilder than Billie Jean 
 Gotta have paper for life 
 You ain't with it, you a L 
 Still getting it, yeah, bails 
 Break it down on the scale 
 If it add up, hell yeah, I do it 
 Lap back and seen ran to it 
 Like a thief in the night 
 I take anything but some pussy 
 Suck that head like a dyke 
 She got that head that I like 
 Deep in your partner ain't right 
 Put that lil babe on ice 
 I make the paper like rice 
 Head on that bucket, your mothafuckin' life, Skoob 
 I promise you don't know me 
 I pull up bout my cake 
 Where I'm from is not safe 
 I got fish, I'm a lake 
 Scoop them grits on a plate 
 Yet she thought it was steak 
 I'm a thief in the night 
 Make her ride like a bike
