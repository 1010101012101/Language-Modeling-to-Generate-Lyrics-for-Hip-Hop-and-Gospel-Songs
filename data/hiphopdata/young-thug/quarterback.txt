Ninth grade 
 Listen nigga 
 Yeah 
 Gah 
 Ninth grade, quarterback, Washington High 
 When you in the trap, all these rules apply 
 Keep it in your lap, not to the side 
 End up successful all your cars glide 
 Breathe easy, bitch I might just teach ya 
 Not a pleaser, I might Mickey Ds her 
 Top rope, I might John Cena (scene her) 
 Got in a nigga, aye, no meal 
 Momma duck eating good, like she 'posed to 
 Spent a dub on my teeth and my Ghost too 
 Spent a sixty on the bracelet call it old news 
 Spent a dime on the red carpet oh, oh 
 So many black chains on, look like a goatee 
 Pop pills every week 
 Your bitch gon' suck me, look like she don't got no teeth 
 She even suck it better than the time she ordered me 
 Bring a Molly, yeah I'll see 
 I'm smoking pack while you smoke weed 
 Just 'cause I'm signed, don't mean treat me 
 Ninth grade, quarterback, Washington High 
 When you in the trap, all these rules apply 
 Keep it in your lap, not to the side 
 Been so successful, all your cars glide 
 Breathe easy, bitch I might just teach ya 
 Not a pleaser, I might Mickey Ds her 
 Top rope, I might just seen her 
 Got in a nigga, aye, no meal 
 Fifty bands on your head, my niggas take the charge 
 All of my niggas one thousand, they get it 
 Your niggas, you flexing, and fraudulent 
 Two bitches with me they m√©naging 
 I fuck them, then smash them, put them on the market 
 I make them go cook and they bring me the money back 
 Move in silent like camouflagin' 
 Shoutout Skippa tha Flippa, came up from nickles 
 Green diamonds like a dill pickle 
 Everybody know that I'm in the field 
 Drinking and pouring a double seal 
 Remember the days when I would roll one 
 And taking trips across the country just for money 
 You fuck with my squad then they start thumping 
 Take the pot and slam dunk it, Tim Duncan 
 Ninth grade, quarterback, Washington High 
 When you in the trap, all these rules apply 
 Keep it in your lap, not to the side 
 Been so successful, all your cars glide 
 Breathe easy, bitch I might just teach ya 
 Not a pleaser, I might Mickey Ds her 
 Top rope, I might John Cena 
 Got in a nigga, aye, no meal 
 These niggas be watching, they speculate 
 Feeling myself but no masturbation 
 I'm 22, rich with no education 
 The world's gonna end one day, read it in Revelations 
 Good girl she deserve a scholarship 
 The pistol like lighters, you know that I pocket it 
 These bitches be callin' my phone 
 And I'm making, I'm dabbing 
 And know my diamonds came in from Africa 
 Smoking on Salvia that came from El Salvador 
 Got on my Cartier eating on caviar 
 She be super licking on a nigga 
 Double down FN shooting out missiles 
 Cowards get attention like a nigga when he whistle 
 Them niggas caught you slripping cause you didn't have a pistol 
 OG gas bag and I flip it like a nickel 
 Two bitches with me nigga, call me Malcolm in the middle 
 Ninth grade, quarterback, Washington High 
 When you in the trap, all these rules apply 
 Keep it in your lap, not to the side 
 Been so successful, all your cars glide 
 Breathe easy, bitch I might just teach ya 
 Not a pleaser, I might Mickey Ds her 
 Top rope, I might just seen her 
 Got in a nigga, aye, no meal 
 Ninth grade I was serving quarterpound 
 Trap rules, nigga scrap, jugging pounds 
 Make them move it like John Cena 
 Catch a nigga bitch while I'm eating 
 Diamonds on my neck, blinging 
 In the phantom opera leaning 
 Two double cup got me feigning 
 I dream of genie bitches in bikinis 
 They dreaming for the fettuccine 
 Pull up and drop my top off like Houdini 
 Giuseppe's on my feet, some foreign zebras 
 Motor fitted, dabbing in the Lee 
 Sit ya ass down like I'm Beanie Sigel 
 What's crackin', crippin' nigga, twisting fingers 
 Longway and Thugger jump in the nina 
 I slip in your club with the forty and nina 
 Look at his head call it buzzle bee 
 Smoking OG Moon Rocks that I mix with the Diesel 
 Gavanchi walking on the stars 
 Look at these bitches, just eat it up 
 Choke on the dick, she just clean it up 
 Pull up in a fuckin' Bentley truck 
 Longway bitch
