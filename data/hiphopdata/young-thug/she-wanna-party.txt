Drinks in the air 
 Rich nigga put that ace of spade in the air 
 Mack a couple bitches, yeah we played everywhere 
 Shake it up and pop it, damn she sprayed everywhere 
 And we be saucin' 
 I love her so you know I got to floss and 
 I'm not a dentist but a nigga flossin' 
 I'm fresh to death, they say I should be coughin' 
 I'm 'bout to turn it up 
 She wanna party with a real nigga 
 She wanna party with a real nigga 
 Shawty wanna party with a real nigga 
 She wanna party with a real nigga 
 She wanna party, she wanna party 
 She wanna party, she wanna party 
 Twist it like a Tootsie Roll, Roll, Roll 
 Like a movie play your fuckin' role, role, role 
 Can't believe my circle small like Cheerios 
 Hate to say it but this ain't another Bankroll 
 She tried to pop it all for me 
 Lil shawty tried to drop it all for me 
 But I see right through her body 
 That she just want her money, she just vibin' 
 And if you lick her she just wanna pop it 
 And if you with her bring battery rocket 
 Fucked her good and now her heart is in my pocket 
 Her heart beatin' by the racin' but we gotta pace it 
 Sit on my face, that pussy wet like she fresh out the lake and 
 I milked this place, I beat the case, crank up my generator 
 I got some X, I got some syrup, I'm smokin' turtle tank and 
 And we be saucin' 
 I love her so you know I got to floss and 
 I'm not a dentist but a nigga flossin' 
 I'm fresh to death, they say I should be coughin' 
 I'm 'bout to turn it up 
 She wanna party with a real nigga 
 She wanna party with a real nigga 
 Shawty wanna party with a real nigga 
 She wanna party with a real nigga 
 She wanna party, she wanna party 
 She wanna party, she wanna party 
 I don't know if you gon' roll with me 
 I'm tryna see if you gon' stroll with me 
 Jeffery tryna roll 
 You should try livin' with a gangster 
 Stay down with me if I'm banged up 
 I'ma do or die with you no matter what 
 No matter what 
 Everything about you please me 
 Darlin' now hurry up, I'll eat that pussy 
 From you, away could never push me darlin' 
 I want you for real 
 And if you feel like I wasted your time, I reimburse 
 Now I might put a little interest on it 
 Okay about you, I'm ready to kill 
 I'ma come back on it, appeal 
 Look at my kit, I reimburse 
 And I just might pull a HNDRXX on her 
 Trendsetter era 
 Rich nigga put that ace of spade in the air 
 Mack a couple bitches, yeah we played everywhere 
 Shake it up and pop it, damn she sprayed everywhere 
 And we be saucin' 
 I love her so you know I got to floss and 
 I'm not a dentist but a nigga flossin' 
 I'm fresh to death, they say I should be coughin' 
 I'm 'bout to turn it up 
 She wanna party with a real nigga 
 She wanna party with a real nigga 
 Shawty wanna party with a real nigga 
 She wanna party with a real nigga 
 She wanna party, she wanna party 
 She wanna party, she wanna party
