I rock water like a fuckin' whale 
 Drug got expenses like a fuckin' bill 
 I like girls, I'm a fuckin' male 
 Nigga movin slower then a snail, watch me 
 Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin' 
 Overdosin', overdosin' 
 Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin' 
 Overdosin', overdosin' 
 The walls are closin', I'm overdosin' 
 I'm cookin' some fish, she put on some lotion 
 I'm stackin' that money, I want it the oldest 
 Bitch I am a warrior, you know that it's in me 
 I'm hangin' with players, you know that I'm pimpin' 
 My son is suspended, can't ride in the Bentley 
 What's wrong these birds? these birds are trippin' 
 Four thousand on shoe strings, you know I ain't trippin' 
 One minute I swerve, baby call them birds 
 Tell it right to her face, put that dick in her life today 
 Thugger bring 'em Benjis to the T 
 I don't need a door to hand over them keys 
 Have a white T look like Miskeen 
 Batter up, polo, saddle up, football tackle, hoe 
 Pussy nigga, caterpillar, Steward Little, hike 
 Get fresh, diamonds everywhere, styled by, my Ike 
 Paris Hilton, Master P Miller, big C member 
 Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin' 
 Overdosin', overdosin' 
 Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin' 
 Overdosin', overdosin' 
 I OD, ODB, dirty nose, coca√≠n' 
 Neck, ears, wrist, fingers, Aquafina, wreck the Bentley 
 Bought the Vette had wreck in that, growin' green like a chia pet 
 Bought a condominium just to smoke in it till I vomit, and I'm so honest 
 London just walked in, I'm like "God damn" and "I miss my bro" (London on the Track) 
 Your bitch just walked out with Young Thug, now you like, "Damn I miss my hoe" (Give her back) 
 I'm the type of nigga that nut on her back 
 You the type of nigga that can't miss that hoe 
 You the type of nigga that kiss her in the mouth after she drank my olay, oh 
 Drink it drink it, copped the new coupe yeah sank it, sank it 
 Hundred bands ain't a damn thang, I'm a spread it out need to pay pay 
 Catch me riding with your main thing, I'm a feed her bands no cuff links 
 I can even say the same thing, my fans geeked up, they on the same page 
 Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin' 
 Overdosin', overdosin' 
 Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin' 
 Overdosin', overdosin'
