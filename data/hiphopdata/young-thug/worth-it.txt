Got my bae with me, you know what I'm sayin'? 
 If she don't get what she want she whine 
 I reminisce when I get high 
 Looked up baby and say goodbye 
 I tied my ties, she no longer cry, look you in your eyes, tell you that 
 I know she livin' for a nigga, dyin' for a nigga 
 I whip that pussy with no bowl jumpin' out, lil nigga 
 That pussy look just like a cut, a soakin' cut, lil nigga 
 Yeah, I'm a freak, you know I'm pullin' out the lunch, lil nigga 
 And bruh, I'd never snooze to lose, I would never snooze to lose on you 
 Yeah, I'mma give you a couple bands, want some more boobs on you 
 Hey, I'mma sit back and pay attention like school on you 
 Yeah, I'mma shoot inside that pussy like a whoadie on you 
 Goddamn, I'm sorry b, I know you'd accepted my apology 
 I know that ass fat, apple bottom please 
 I need a deep throat baby, swallow me 
 I love it when you're around baby, follow me 
 I only eat green like koala leaf 
 We shoot with big guns like a Call of D 
 She never say no, she ain't stallin' me 
 I got more of that dope in the a safe, hey 
 Can't shoot with a pistol, need a K 
 No, you can't see it, it is tragic by your face 
 But when it need air, air it out in a safe lil place 
 I can see it on her face that she gettin' wet 
 When she don't get what she want she whine 
 I reminisce when I get high 
 Looked up baby and say goodbye 
 I tied my ties, she no longer cry, look you in your eyes 
 Tell you that, I know she worth it 
 No these ain't no drugs, I know she worth it 
 Yeah, my mama say that she ain't perfect 
 But if this is how I'm feelin', it's gonna work 
 Yeah, I need some kush, I'm on that purp 
 Damn, I broke her heart, now my heart hurt 
 I don't know why but I done cut down on that syrup 
 At least I got that lil bitch ballin', she don't gotta work 
 Oh-no-no, she ain't had no job, but she have a purse 
 Yeah-yeah-yeah, she know I'm the truth, places I'm in first 
 No-no-no, I don't want you bitches, y'all basic and thirsty 
 Yeah-yeah, she taught me well It took some time, but it was worth it 
 She get on top and ride it, kentucky derby 
 She see me count that money like I'm nerdy 
 I'mma ball some with my dawgs but they ain't curvy 
 Her whole body (hypnotizing), I call it perfect 
 And I swear if she don't... 
 Get what she want she whine 
 I reminisce when I get high 
 Looked up baby and say goodbye 
 I tied my ties, she no longer cry, look you in your eyes 
 Tell you that, I know she worth it 
 No these ain't no drugs, I know she worth it 
 Yeah, my mama say that she ain't perfect 
 But if this is how I'm feelin', it's gonna work 
 Yeah, I need some kush, I'm on that purp
