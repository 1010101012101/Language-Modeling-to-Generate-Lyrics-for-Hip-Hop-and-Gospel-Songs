 Well this is why-a-why-a-why 
 Well this is why-a-why-a-why

 Who you loyal to? Me or us? 
 Who you trust the most? Me or us? 
 Who you wanna fuck every night? Me or us? 
 Who you wanna take on your flight? Me or us? 
 Ow! 
 You the one that said you were doin' it 
 And you said you were doin' it, you're doin' it, you're doin' it 
 You say that what you're doin', you're doin', you're doin' 
 You told me that what, what you're doin', you're doin', you're doin' 
 But what you do if your brother left you? 
 What would you do if them niggas came for you? 
 You better pursue (watch out) 
 I just spent 10 racks on a dog from Germany, no Purdue 
 Oops, I meant Dupree, jury sittin' on their seat 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 I wanna know, tell me, lil' baby, I wanna know 
 I wanna know 
 I got the show, fuck my show, be my show

 I got them loafs, I'm with Metro, he got some more 
 Yeah, I don't gotta talk 
 Nigga, my jewelry, it can say more, hey 
 You smoke that kush and man I'm so good and I want some cookies 
 Fuck on your daughter, fuck on my brother 
 Now she gon' diss you 
 I got them racks, I was just buyin' 
 You was just lookin' 
 I bought her diamonds and she just smilin' 
 She think she tooken, but 
 This one is all for my fans 
 I'm smokin' pot while in Japan 
 Blacker the berry, drink my cran 
 Bae you dig it? Understand 
 (Humming) 
 Well this is why-a-why-a-why
