A young nigga's life is a dream 
 We ain't lettin' no hoes get between 
 When my diamonds speak, they say "bling" 
 Yellow diamonds, no crime scene 
 This that rich shit, I eat fish and grits 
 Catch me boolin' with my dogs, just like Michael Vick 
 I don't give no damn if they throw it off, I won't fuckin' miss 
 Bitch I'm so up, no Sleepy Brown, wouldn't talk to him 'bout shit 
 Ya dig? 
 I want you to talk to the hand while I talk to bands 
 I might go on and stop playin' and take over the land 
 My money long as school buses, ain't talkin' no Xans 
 Sit still, I'm cool coming 
 Pull up and then spray it 
 50 dub, know I'm sayin'? 
 100 bloods in my fam 
 100 bloods, them not fans 
 Fuck the beach, I got sand 
 PS3, I'm not playin' 
 Go gentle on my lil' man 
 She wanna stay where I'm stayin' 
 I'm booted up, I could land 
 My car is fast, I should drag 
 Versace white, Ku Klux Klan 
 Don't care if he's Crip, he still fam 
 No I ain't? Bitch, I am 
 But when I do I might need help up 
 And I wanna be like Mike and I ain't talkin' Phelps, bruh 
 A young nigga's life is a dream 
 We ain't lettin' no hoes get between 
 When my diamonds speak, they say "bling" 
 Yellow diamonds, no crime scene 
 This that rich shit, I eat fish and grits 
 Catch me boolin' with my dogs, just like Michael Vick 
 I don't give no damn if they throw it off, I won't fuckin' miss 
 Bitch I'm so up, no Sleepy Brown, wouldn't talk to him 'bout shit 
 Ya dig? 
 Hey how you doin'? I'm Yak Gotti, I got bodies on bodies 
 I'm with Thugger, that's my woadie, yeah my round, that's my compadre 
 And we solid, oh so solid, if I get caught I won't say nothin' 
 YSL, we be mobbin', I'm forreal, this beat knockin' 
 Trigger, boy I got you, Rico, boy I got you 
 I'm livin' out my dreams, broke is not an option 
 Yeah I'm livin' out my dreams, broke is not an option 
 A young nigga's life is a dream 
 We ain't lettin' no hoes get between
