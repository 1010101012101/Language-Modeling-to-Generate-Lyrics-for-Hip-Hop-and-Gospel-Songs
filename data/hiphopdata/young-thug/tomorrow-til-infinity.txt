(Hope I see you, tomorrow 
 I'm tryna see you, tomorrow) 
 I'm the black Christian Gray, you know what I'm sayin' 
 (I wanna be you, tomorrow) 
 I got fifty shades of baes with me, fifty different bitches 
 Yeah! 
 (I want you, tomorrow 
 I'm tryna see you, tomorrow 
 I'm tryna see you, tomorrow 
 Tomorrow) 
 I know you act right, right 
 I got three bitches on a slide 
 I put some Forgis on my ride 
 Me and my dawgs headed to the sky 
 Cloud nine calling me 
 Couple bad bitches too 
 I got mine on me 
 Listen to them digits, ooh 
 Feet up, baby girl, let's live 
 PJ money yeah, bae let's go on a limb 
 Two racks for my shooter, my Jimmy Choo 
 My bitch in Chanel, pity the fool 
 I got Chanel on my socks, silk and Versace her crotch 
 Ben and Jerry, gotta eat her ice cream 
 I came from pillow to post 
 Ice in my bag, my back on froze 
 Penthouse home, Chicago 
 Yeah, my second home 
 I'm in that limo 
 I just got back home 
 I got my money now 
 Tat my reals, hillstone 
 I just wanna see tomorrow 
 I'm tryna see tomorrow 
 Let's fly away 
 Long time, ain't late 
 I was speed racing, ay 
 I know you right, right, right 
 But I'm tired of try-y-ying 
 No matter what you gotta stay by my side 
 Right or wrong, you better ride or die 
 Till infinity, till infinity, till infinity, till infinity 
 Ride, ride, ride, till infinity 
 I'm 'bout to buy you your own ride 
 I don't need you involved in homicides 
 Getting a weave in case you think you fried 
 I'm 'bout to fuck this ho outside 
 Horses make my three-wheeler slide 
 Actavis gang till I, die 
 Shawty was weak, oh-oh (gangbangers) 
 Shawty was weak, oh-oh 
 Hold up, money is the reason I arrived 
 Bitch, I keep a knife like Michael Myers 
 I was 'bout to stab 'em thirty times like porcupines 
 But I got the rainbow diamonds on like Mike 'n' Ikes 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah 
 Oh yeah 
 Oh, yeah 
 I know you right, right, right 
 But I'm tired of try-y-ying 
 No matter what you gotta stay by my side 
 Right or wrong, you better ride or die 
 Till infinity, till infinity, till infinity, till infinity 
 Ride, ride, ride, till infinity 
 I want you, tomorrow 
 I'm tryna see you, tomorrow 
 I'm tryna see you, tomorrow 
 Tomorrow
