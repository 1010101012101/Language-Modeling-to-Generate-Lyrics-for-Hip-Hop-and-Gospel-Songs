So what's up with all that goddamn tough talk you had earlier on the phone, you know what I'm saying? When you said you was 'gon goddamn do this and that to me? 
 You told me (freaky-deeky) 
 Where all that at? oh I thought so 
 You got high level confidence you knahmsayin' 
 You said you' gone fuck me to death when you see me 
 You said that, you said that 
 You said you 'gone do me the worst, I remember you right said that 
 You said you 'gone kiss from my neck to my chest to my naval and dick and nuts 
 We talked about everything, then you know that we got us some making up 
 I lick on that puss on a pill, and I make her stand up like some bunny ears 
 I bite on that butt, then I suck on her toes and her soul go outta here 
 She look at him like he 'gone kill her and I turn 'round and light like I'm Dr. Phil 
 Let's get freaky deeky around here 
 Say it now, ooh, ooh, ooh 
 Say it now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to say now) 
 Say it now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to say now) 
 Say it now (Jeffery!), ooh, ooh, ooh 
 I got the door unlocked 
 And I know right now she'd rather have my dick than a watch 
 And I'm not right about her friend, but I got a strong feeling she'll take real charge and run into the narcs 
 And I'm seeing all your emotions, came a long way from roaches 
 Ride around the 'berg get the rollie 
 I ain't ever need a nothing brodie 
 I'm full pocket, macaroni 
 Rose-gold, AP, like a token 
 Bought that bitch a mink, now she cozy 
 Rather go to jail, I ain't told 'em 
 I get excited when I see you 
 I'd rather freeze up and get shot when I see you 
 Oh, they dreaming and standing and I drive in the rear view 
 You cool, and you a real one 
 Let's go to Africa, to the Pilgrim 
 You said you' gone fuck me to death when you see me 
 You said that, you said that 
 You said you 'gone do me the worst, I remember you right when you said that 
 You said you 'gone kiss from my neck to my chest to my naval and dick and nuts 
 We talked about everything, then you know that we got us some making up 
 I lick on that puss on a pill, and I make her stand up like some bunny ears 
 I bite on that butt, then I suck on her toes and her soul go outta here 
 She look at him like he 'gone kill her and I turn 'round and light him like I'm bouta feel 
 Let's get freaky deeky around here 
 Say it now, ooh, ooh, ooh 
 Say it now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to) 
 Say it now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to) 
 Say it now, ooh, ooh, ooh 
 Let's make out last song 
 She get the last goal 
 I got some Actavis 
 I want the last dose 
 I got a good cash flow 
 But I don't want the fast dough 
 Your daughter got filthy rich 
 I came right out the rat-hole 
 I smoked a whole eighth 
 I'm drinking codeine 
 I want some head in here 
 I don't want no teeth 
 I should've called off 
 I'm bout to OD 
 Then I'm off like a golf ball 
 My two homies 
 Lay it up on me 
 I make her squirt on the couch 
 Private party on that blouse 
 We play for the Cavs, no beers 
 Every diamond on me, crystal clear 
 Molly on me, baby, take it off of me 
 CAT scan, white stuff on my jeans 
 Hit it from the back, loosen up her spleen 
 Say you mine, Imma take it off and raw dog 
 You said you' gone fuck me to death when you see me 
 You said that, you said that 
 You said you 'gone do me the worst, I remember you right when you said that 
 You said you 'gone kiss from my neck to my chest to my naval and dick and nuts 
 We talked about everything, then you know that we got us some making up 
 I lick on that puss on a pill, and I make her stand up like some bunny ears 
 I bite on that butt, then I suck on her toes and her soul go outta here 
 She look at him like he 'gone kill her and I turn 'round and light him like I'm bouta feel 
 Let's get freaky deaky around here 
 Say it now, ooh, ooh, ooh 
 Say it now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to) 
 Say it now, ooh, ooh, ooh (I want you to) 
 Say it now, ooh, ooh, ooh
