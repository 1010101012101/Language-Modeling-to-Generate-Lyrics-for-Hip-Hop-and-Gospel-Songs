 And when I tell this shit from round here

 While they rolling loud 
 Smokin' backwoods and moving baggage

 Yellow school buses that's a Xanax 
 Causing me to sleep and I ain't plan it (yee haw) 
 I got some jobs all day 
 Roll out the jar all day 
 I be on Mars all day 
 I'm with the stars all day

 Roll up the raw all day 
 Babysit your dog all day 
 Boutta watch you jog all day

 Bagged a bad bitch, I got a foreign son 
 Tommy Gunn, found a real Tommy gun 
 I dropped a milly on my chain, I got no Barry Bonds 
 And I got a head full of hair like I'm from Amazon 
 Uh, blaze that ass like a candle honey 
 Uh, Ferragamo shower shoes for me 
 Uh, light pole and it got jewels on it 
 Uh, like an ol' school I got some pooled on it 
 Huh, Satan, abracadabra, abracadabra 
 Kill all you bastards, I want no wrassle 
 The bread ambassador, no nuttin else matter to him 
 I'm ballin' like Patrick Ewing 
 Turn up on you bastards 
 Hop in a Ghost like Casper 
 Everything go smooth for me, like I got my Masters 
 Fubu Platinum up, birds in the Acura 
 Albums platinum and up, I'm killin' these bastards 
 Like family don't matter, oh, oh

 Country Billy made a couple milly 
 Tryna park the Rolls Royce inside the Piccadilly 
 All he had was a couple of stripes actually (of course) 
 Got another half a milly in white tees, of course 
 Don't you panic, don't you take this shit for granted 
 Don't you panic, when I put my dick in your panties 
 Don't you panic, when I catch up with yo bitch you know I'm smashing 
 I, I can put her on her feet, oh, oh head gasket 
 You gotta tell me what's wrong 
 I can't wait to deep stroke to the morning 
 I gotta put my dick in yo mouth right when you yawn 
 You gotta put that puss on my lips whenever I'm on one 
 I think the red dot, so I put my bum, bum 
 I'm bout to fuck somebody girl off this rum, rum (Go head)

 Rolling through the W6 
 You feeling me 
 I'm feeling you 
 Falling deep, too deep 
 Purple dreams I catch myself 
 I be havin' nightmares shaped like you 
 You be blowin' smoke out shaped like me 
 I be havin' nightmares shaped like you 
 You be blowin' smoke out shaped like me 
 Two cups can I drown? And I might too 
 Hear the track, spin it back, catch a vibe too 
 This the shit that be bad, so bad it's good for you 
 I just thought that you should know 
 Take a hit, we can sip like it's medicine 
 Chemistry, remedy, there's no better than 
 This the shit that be bad, so bad it's good for you 
 Like family don't matter, oh, oh
