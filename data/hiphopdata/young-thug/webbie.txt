Thugger! 
 I roll me one, smoke to the face 
 I roll me one, smoke to the face 
 Roll up a blunt and I'ma face it 
 King slime aye 
 They politickin' 'bout these cases 
 I told her roll me up a blunt and I'ma face it 
 Trouble maker man 
 I've been shootin' out with my neighbors, yeah 
 My lil niggas been tryna trap it out in the vacant, yeah 
 Patek Phillipe, they got my wrist and they don't play with that 
 She been suckin' dick way before a nigga made it, yeah 
 Pass me the mothafuckin' lighter 
 Lil mama overseas, I'ma Skype her 
 Nigga checkin' out the squad, tryna bite us 
 But my hand is way different got the Midas 
 Do a dream with me, aye do some things with me 
 Bae drink your lean with me, bae fall asleep with me 
 Ay fall asleep, we drive 
 Jeopardize your life or mines 
 Let me fuck one more time 
 And I'll help you write your rhymes 
 It's extremely fake 
 They politickin' 'bout these cases 
 I told her roll me up a blunt and I'ma face it 
 Troublemaker man 
 I've been shootin' out with my neighbors, yeah 
 My lil niggas tryna trap it out in the vacant, yeah 
 Patek Phillipe they got my wrist and they don't play with that 
 She been suckin' dick way before a nigga made it, yeah 
 Bad, bad, bad 
 Got them plans, plans, plans 
 I'll pop at your man, man, man 
 I'll do what I can, on a Xan 
 Guess I'm geeked up 
 Like an astronaut, I'm off Earth 
 I'm way in the moon, kickin' shit without a broom 
 My mama can't lose 
 I'ma keep her in a fresh car 
 And I'm good on the fuel 
 I'ma keep her so froze up 
 Yeah I'ma keep her in some jewels 
 I'ma go 'head and nut in my bitch 
 I'ma gon' and give her juice 
 She did two times now, I done told her that was rude 
 They don't wanna see you win 
 Nah they want you always to lose 
 They gon' always want you be stuck with them 
 They'll never wish you good luck on them 
 And they'll never wish bad luck either 
 And I don't know what the fuck to think either 
 Got a foreign car like a white beatle 
 Actin' like she like people 
 Knowin' they don't give two fucks if they're still here 
 They'll leave her 
 This politician is so fake 
 They politickin' 'bout these cases 
 I told her roll me up a blunt and I'ma face it 
 Troublemaker man 
 I've been shootin' out with my neighbors, yeah 
 My lil niggas been tryna trap it out in the vacant, yeah 
 Patek Phillipe they got my wrist and they don't play with that 
 She been suckin' dick way before a nigga made it, yeah 
 Got off my ass and I got tired of waitin' 
 Mama say, "You gonna make it, you gotta be patient" 
 Came out the hood, trap out the stove out that vacant 
 Now we flyin' different places, fuckin' bitches all different races 
 I did this shit that they thought I wouldn't do and I made it 
 I was so down, man it's so fucked up, couldn't make over 80 
 I lost some friends, that was so fucked up and I know that they hate me 
 Thugger, he gave me a chance and I had to take it 
 Used to chop on the block with the 380 
 Now when I pull up they gotta pay me 
 I came from nothing more than the 80s 
 These niggas actors like Patrick Swayze 
 I gotta get it, I can't be lazy 
 Didn't have a dime so my mama crazy 
 Ran up a sack with Thugger, baby 
 Man this shit so amazing 
 Patek Phillipe 
 Cost a hundred bands, man 
 Clear nothing' on it 
 Then I went and seen Elliott and iced up my Pigalle, you dig 
 That's on Big Duck, that's on all 6, know I'm sayin'? 
 I got like a 170, 180 thousand dollar watch, bro 
 And it glow up green at night 
 And when the sun hit it on the plane 
 You understand what I'm sayin'? 
 Yeah, I used to do this shit to maintain 
 Till I started usin' 14% of my brain 
 And that left me with 5 stars worth of stains, you dig? 
 Thugger!
