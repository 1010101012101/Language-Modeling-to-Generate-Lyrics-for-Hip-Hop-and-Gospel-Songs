It's a motherfuckin' miracle 
 Yeah it's a motherfuckin' miracle 
 I make a half to a whole one 
 Yeah that's a motherfuckin' miracle 
 Broke nigga turn a million now 
 Yeah it's a motherfuckin' miracle 
 Got 26's on my vehicles 
 And it's a motherfuckin' miracle 
 Now I ain't motherfuckin' lyrical 
 Got 54's in my living room 
 My bedroom is the chicken room 
 I'm eatin' like it's Thanksgiving fool 
 And I do it like a nigga do 
 I rap up but I pull the trigger too 
 Your best bet, get a bigger crew 
 I'm playin' chess while you shootin' pool 
 Make your next move, be your best move 
 Run up on Guwap, I'ma let loose 
 What you mad for, nigga I'm upset too 
 They say yellow jewelry jeweler in the restroom 
 On the top a nigga hit you with a bar stool 
 You the type of bitch that make-up, wear a costume 
 You little boys better go and watch some cartoons 
 'Cause I'm my own man, nigga I'm my own goon 
 And I swear I got a whip game incredible 
 God take my breath now if I'm scared of you 
 I turn your best friend to a fuckin' vegetable 
 But I'ma stop talkin', I ain't tryna lecture you 
 I'm the president, nigga it's election year 
 EA dictator, ain't no re-elections here 
 Spectator nigga, test that's ahead of you 
 Before I dap you up, I'd rather wet you up 
 It's a motherfuckin' miracle 
 Yeah it's a motherfuckin' miracle 
 I make a half to a whole one 
 Yeah that's a motherfuckin' miracle 
 Broke nigga turn a million now 
 Yeah it's a motherfuckin' miracle 
 Got 26's on my vehicles 
 And it's a motherfuckin' miracle 
 AK's, ain't no pistols here 
 And we gon' wet you up here 
 Now is a motherfuckin' miracle 
 How I put a hundred bands in one ear 
 I got 2 on, 2 hundred bands in my ear 
 Who this nigga here, standing mighty close to my rear, I'm just keepin' it real 
 I'll go shoot his ass and his rear, damage my career 
 Hundred bands make me stand here 
 Diamonds come from Sears 
 Bitch I'm just playin', I appear, diamonds crystal clear 
 Oh you you got them bands, OK dear, we gon' milk you here 
 Might be broke, I tattoo tears, and no M & M's 
 I'ma throw that boy in that blood, I need? 
 Guwap set up shop anywhere, anytime ho 
 Thugga come with blocks anywhere, any kind ho 
 Green bells, white bells, oh that smell, yeah that smell 
 Very rare, we everywhere 
 You never dare, you in a wheelchair 
 I'll take that bitch, slut that bitch 
 Fuck that bitch, suck that bitch 
 Send that bitch back to you dead broke, she like money in men 
 Suck you like a tick for your paper 
 Just to bring it back to me 
 She like when I shine like a glacier 
 My pinky rings are equator 
 My cups ain't no maper, I meant maple 
 Apple juice, purple, baby bottles, gerbler 
 I mean Gerber, kill shit, murder, sipper 
 ? It's a motherfuckin' miracle, I'm lyrical 
 It's a motherfuckin' miracle 
 Yeah it's a motherfuckin' miracle 
 I make a half to a whole one 
 Yeah that's a motherfuckin' miracle 
 Broke nigga turn a million now 
 Yeah it's a motherfuckin' miracle 
 Got 26's on my vehicles 
 And it's a motherfuckin' miracle
