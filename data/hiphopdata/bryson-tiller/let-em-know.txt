 "Who is he" 
 Muthafucka' I'm him

 So let them niggas know it's mines 
 Already got someone that's what you tell 'em every time 
 That shit ain't up for grabs

 I come to where you at 
 Fuck around and end up your last 
 I won't hold back 
 I won't hold back 
 It's about time I do it 
 It's about time I say this shit 
 Spent a lot of time on the waiting list 
 Roll up the doja then blaze that shit 
 Who gonna give you love an insane as this 
 A-game girl, I bring that shit 
 I know you want the same last name as him 
 Him being Tiller he a solid young nigga, he been real ever since 
 I know you been tense 
 I know we ain't had a conversation in a minute 
 But you know what they say 
 If it ain't broke then don't fix it, it's clearly not broken 
 It's just so unfinished 
 I feel like my new bitch was just your apprentice 
 So we just got into it, here comes the ending 
 You said this shit would happen girl, that was your prediction 
 Said I'd never find no one like you and I should of listened 
 Who you fucking with now is that any of my business 
 Whoever it is may not be finished 
 But... 
 I'm coming back for good 
 So let them niggas know it's mines 
 Already got someone that's what you tell 'em every time 
 That shit ain't up for grabs 
 Where you at on the map 
 I come to where you at 
 Fuck around and end up your last 
 I won't hold back 
 I won't hold back 
 Hope you still feel the same way 
 Don't say the same shit to me you'll never change 
 Oh yeah

 Can we do it like old times or nah, so fly 
 Oh why, didn't you 
 Tell me get my shit together and think it through 
 A nigga just was sitting here not knowing what to do
