Yeah, when 
 When I look you in your face 
 I see a good girl who deserves better than me (better than me) 
 You remember that other night in my bedroom? On top of my bed 
 I remember the things that you said 
 Sometimes I forget 
 Sometimes you gotta put me in check, ay 
 In check, yeah, in check, yeah 
 In check, yeah, in check, yeah 
 Hollywood, set back 
 3 hours, I'm jet-lagged 
 Still tryna lay up with somethin' 
 Can't believe I just said that 
 Album, overdue 
 You would find it hard to focus too 
 If you met the women I have 
 Hard not to get side tracked, oh whoa 
 Hey, don't know where my mind at 
 Hoping you can help find that 
 I wish I could rewind back (I love you) 
 Way back so you could put me 
 Put me in check, yeah, in check, yeah 
 What did I do to you? 
 Made a fool of you 
 I know they told you I'd never be true to you 
 I'm losing you, losing you 
 I miss you in my bedroom, on top of my bed 
 How could I forget what you said? 
 Sometimes I forget 
 And sometimes you gotta put me in check, ay 
 In check, yeah, in check, yeah 
 In check, yeah, in check, yeah 
 Baby, no 
 Baby, no, no
