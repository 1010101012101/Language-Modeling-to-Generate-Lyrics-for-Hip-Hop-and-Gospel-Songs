Haha, uh huh 
 Of course I had to make a song about you right now 
 I told you I was gon' make this song about you here 
 Yeah, ay 
 Bad lil' thing, yeah 
 True Religion jeans, yeah 
 Super clean 
 What's good with you and me 
 Chasing dreams, yeah 
 Hit me when you free, yeah 
 Sex me 
 That's just what I needed 
 (You, you got it, got it) 
 That's what I needed 
 (You got it, got it) 
 Just what I needed 
 (You, you got it, got it) 
 You got what I needed, ay 
 I got what you need 
 Shop-shop-shopping bags, Louis shoes 
 Pop the tags, that's for you 
 Diamond necklace, that's for you 
 I just blew a check or two 
 Girl, my mind been set on you 
 Yeah, you know I fuck with you 
 Club is through 
 What are we getting into? 
 Let me tell you, girl, before you go 
 There's a few things you should know 
 I'm still struggling with the dos and don'ts 
 But I felt compelled to let you know that you a 
 Bad lil' thing, yeah 
 True Religion jeans, yeah 
 Super clean, yeah 
 What's good with you and me, yeah 
 Chasing dreams, yeah 
 Hit me when you free, yeah

 Oh it's just what I needed 
 Oh, it's just what I 
 Yeah, you got what I need 
 And I got what you need 
 When I look at you, I see someone I don't deserve 
 When I pretend like my vision blurry 
 Is it love I'm searchin' for or different word? 
 Looked at me, said when did this occur 
 Soon as I seen you in mini skirt 
 Soon as you hit me with smile first 
 Soon as I heard how your mind works 
 Me and my girl, we just diverted 
 We just went our separate ways, yeah 
 Knew she loved me 'cause I'm paid up 
 That's what I won't make up 
 Yeah, I saw somethin' different in you 
 Had to come and tell you straight up 
 You was headed for the door 
 Headed till you wait up 
 Like ayo, hold up, wait up 
 Hold up, hold up 
 Let me tell you, girl, before you go 
 There's a few things that you should know 
 I don't do this on the usual 
 But I felt compelled to let you know that you a 
 Bad lil' thing, so bad 
 Yeah
