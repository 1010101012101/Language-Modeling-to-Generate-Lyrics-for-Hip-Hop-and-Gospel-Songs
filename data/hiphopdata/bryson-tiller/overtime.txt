You know how I feel about like... us 
 And about like... how I wanna go 
 But you never tell me how you feel about it 
 How you wanna go about it 
 I've been working on it, putting in overtime 
 Putting in overtime, putting in over- 
 I've been putting in work, you know I've been 
 Working overtime, working overtime 
 Working over 
 I've been working on it, putting in overtime 
 Putting in overtime, putting in over- 
 I've been putting in work, you know I've been 
 Working overtime, working overtime 
 Working over 
 Sitting in a whip on the strip, get to stripping 
 My windows is tinted, let's go 
 My backseat ain't empty, we just left the Fendi 
 We getting it all over the clothes 
 This is why I need the Phantom, this is why I need the Phantom 
 And you know business getting handled 
 Wonder where you at, I just might hold you for ransom 
 No that's something your nigga can't fathom 
 Aw man, he just bought a Balmain 
 He thought that would keep her 'round 
 But he thought wrong, nothing at all 
 That's what she got on 
 And she will get up and leave him for me, I know 
 I mean how could he not know? 
 'Cause see 
 I've been working for it, putting in overtime 
 Putting in overtime, putting in over- 
 I've been putting in work, you know I've been 
 Working overtime, working overtime 
 Working over 
 I've been working OT 
 Tryna show you what it's like just to know me 
 And ever since that day you approached me 
 I been thinking 'bout you and you only 
 And we just like to fuck, that's it nothing else 
 Fuck falling in love, that's for someone else 
 I break the bank for you, 'til no money left 
 Now I done caught feelings worth more than millions 
 And I feel it, you hurting and I've been healing 
 Girl that nigga ain't worth it, I know you hear me 
 I know we said we wouldn't let it get this far 
 Now I want it for myself, that's his loss 
 Oh he mad huh? Is he pissed off? 
 Too bad, nigga should've been on his job 
 You know I deserve it, I've been working this hard 
 Ay, is- is you, is you, with it? Yeah (Been working this hard) 
 Po' it up, sip it up, getting lit as fuck 
 We been fucking, on the couch, on the bed 
 Baby girl on my mind, hol' up - there it go 
 Damn, no baby 
 I'm kinda looking for her - for you 
 For you to be my bride, and the mother of my child 
 Oh yeah
