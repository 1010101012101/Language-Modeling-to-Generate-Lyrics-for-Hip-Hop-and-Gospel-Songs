Listen up 
 Oh baby 
 Note to self, stay true to self (True, true, true, true) 
 Shorty, I could use the help (True, true, true, true) 
 And you know what to do to help 
 Going in circles trying not to lose myself 
 No, check up 
 How can I check up? 
 Tell you I messed up 
 We could go somewhere nice 
 Get pretty and get dressed up 
 I always said I should keep you fed and now you're fed up 
 Always said if I ain't happy give you heads up 
 I would rather give you back down, long stroke, legs up 
 Known for giving you the best love 
 No I wouldn't give you nothing less, nothing less, love 
 Used to look at me and tell me, "Don't stress, love" 
 That's why I need you whenever I'm stressed, love 
 Cut me off, tell me stay blessed, love 
 Hey, stay blessed 
 Changes, right now I'm going through changes 
 We upgraded to a crib that's spacious 
 But this house is not a home without you, baby 
 Ain't shed a tear, you just left on me 
 Chuck the deuce, told me, "Stay blessed homie" 
 In due time, I'll regret 
 Especially when I remember you was reppin' when they slept on me (hey) 
 It's been too long 
 I gotta know 
 What must I do to 
 Get me back right beside you? 
 Whenever you decide to 
 Alright 
 Say it's what I get for lying to you 
 I can talk to you whenever 
 Say whatever, yeah 
 You was my best friend 
 It's what I get for lying to you 
 Used to look at me and tell me, "Don't stress, love" 
 That's why I need you when I'm stressed, love 
 Cut me off, tell me stay blessed, love 
 Hey, stay blessed 
 Roll up the carpets, close up the curtains 
 Guess the show is over, I still love you, that's for certain 
 Self righteous but I'm dead wrong, that's for certain 
 If you're tryna make me crazy, baby, it's working 
 Hey, baby, it's working 
 Dealing with clown niggas, know your life a circus 
 I'm still around, I bet he called you when he heard this 
 He's scared you might take me back, I got him nervous 
 Tell him, baby, should he be nervous? 
 And not because I buy you those expensive purses 
 But because the love you got for me is permanent 
 He threw me up under the bus, he say I'm undeserving 
 Don't give him no encouragement 
 I had to soak in some things, I needed nourishment 
 Look at me now, see a nigga really flourishing 
 I wouldn't trade my old life for my current one 
 Hey, no I wouldn't trade it 
 Finna do it for a Huracan 
 Why trade a good woman for an immature one? 
 Or a gold digger for an entrepreneur 
 What I'm saying, mama, you the one 
 Ain't no second time, I fooled you once 
 Be true to you, that's something I don't do enough 
 Cut me off, shawty, I thought you was bluffing 
 Got me blowing up your line 
 What's up with you? What's up? 
 Note to self, stay true to self 
 Shorty, I could use the help 
 And you know what to do to help 
 Going in circles trying not to lose myself, no
