Hey, yeah 
 Haha, I had to put a time stamp on this, yeah 
 It's my birthday 
 And I'm feeling great 
 I feel great 
 Yeah, fuck it, I'm feeling great 
 24 today, by the way 
 Okay 
 Came a long way (yeah, I came a long way) 
 Ay, I looked up and said goddamn I came a long way 
 In the VIP, this shit feel like a showcase 
 Take me to a place I'd rather be, there's no place 
 I gotta pocket full of cash, it's more than I made last year when I was packing 
 Oh wait, it been two years, I lost track and 
 No way I'm going back, I been in mansions 
 I been in whips so quick that you lose traction 
 And made 6 figure transactions 
 Met a lot of pretty women, A.K.A distractions 
 And some fuck niggas with subliminal captions 
 I won't, I won't, show these lames no compassion 
 Wanna play the game, gotta have expansion 
 Ex sent me an email, came with attachments 
 And like a fan of the show, nigga I started snapping 
 What's happening? What's happening? 
 What's happening? What's happening, oh, what's happening? 
 Whoa, whoa, high stakes got me feeling like I'm gambling (I can ball but lose it all) 
 Drink got a nigga rambling (like I'm talking to myself) 
 But hit me up 
 I wake up and see a roof over my head 
 Used to be the roof of a '04 Audi 
 That shit used to be my bed 
 Lot of disrespect from those who used to be my friends 
 Lot of chicks to replace, hoes used to be friends 
 I don't fuck with you, what don't you comprehend? 
 Give a fuck who I offend, real and fake cannot blend 
 And I pray to God I never lose a cake, Amen (Amen) 
 With the high stakes, I'm in 
 I'm in, even when niggas after me 
 I still stroll through the city casually 
 RIP Staten G, Ali gone, that's another tragedy 
 Oh my God, who gon' show the kids strategy? 
 I done seen so many things that they gotta see 
 I made it to the game using honesty 
 I know my mama proud of me 
 God tell her she gave birth to a young prodigy 
 Ay, ay, thank you 
 To the most up 
 High up, high up 
 Praying that them blessings don't stop 
 I'm praying that them blessings don't 
 Yeah
