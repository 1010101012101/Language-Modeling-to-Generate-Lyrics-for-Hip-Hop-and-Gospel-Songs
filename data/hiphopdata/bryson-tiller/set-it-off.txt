Oh, my inspiration comes from you, oh 
 So you think you got what it takes to be my ride or die? 
 Okay, we shall see 
 Ay, I been out here soul searchin' 
 Ay, say you still got it, girl, what makes you so certain? 
 Hit it, quit it, then went cold turkey 
 You been committed through this whole journey 
 Got a girl that don't expect as much from me 
 That's why she gets so much love from me 
 She just might be the one for me 
 Ain't no need to question, now, bitch 
 She 'a pull the gun for me 
 Pop two, she 'a take one for me 
 Set it off, if a bitch come for me 
 Set if off, if a nigga come for me 
 She 'a pull the gun for me 
 Pop two, she 'a take one for me 
 Set it off, if a bitch come for me 
 Set it off, if a nigga come 
 Do you remember them days, I would cut school and come to you 
 Ma' was cool so I got comfortable 
 Sleeping on the couch, sneak up to your room, ay 
 I found out you was a freak too soon, ay 
 Your family thought we had baby too soon, phh 
 I told your family not to speak too soon, ay 
 Three years later, I'm on TV 
 Now your brother, he envy me 
 I don't know what the fuck he be on, ay 
 Cool with me cool, we was never friends 
 He put your mama under stress, I put her in a Benz 
 Even though she put me in the streets, she made amends 
 Watchin' over my baby's nigga 
 'Cause her son wanna go back to his ways and be a street nigga 
 Plus my girl just copped the heat, nigga 
 And she gon' kill almost any nigga 
 Including me, nigga 
 Ain't nobody who could be with her, 'cept for me 
 That's my down bitch 
 She 'a pull the gun for me 
 Pop two, she 'a take one for me 
 Set it off, if a bitch come for me 
 Set it off, if a nigga come for me 
 She 'a pull the gun for me 
 Pop two, she 'a take one for me 
 Set it off, if a bitch come for me 
 Set it off, if a nigga come for me 
 Ooh, yeah 
 Yeah, yeah 
 Ay, think she'll fuck with this song? 
 Yeah, I hope so nigga 
 She ain't call me back for some reason 
 Oh well, I love her
