 Check, check, check 
 Check, check yourself before you wreck yourself 
 Chiddity-check, check yourself before you wreck yourself 
 Ch-ch-check yourself before you wreck yourself

 Check, check yourself before you wreck yourself

 Hey, I'm back, so what's the deal now? 
 I still don't give a fuck 'bout how they feel now 
 I got you hot, lil' nigga, chill out 
 Say you coming for the spot? Bitches will spill now 
 Either staying in the game, bro 
 Fuck the niggas waiting on Young Tiller to change up 
 Niggas waiting on me to run out of paper 
 I don't ever speak on niggas, nah, I barely say much 
 Fuck, I look like, bringing niggas names up? 
 I can't let a fuck nigga get famous 
 These niggas, they wanna de-fame us 
 They wanna betray us, they wanna play games, oh no, no 
 This loyal, this how they won't portray us 
 Looked at my dog like, "Fuck it, let's make 'em hate us" 
 If you got paid for the attention that you paid us 
 You would be a rich nigga but you just a bitch nigga 
 Foreign whip, make you throw a fit, nigga 
 Foreign bitch, I know you won't get with her 
 Lame niggas not the type that she consider 
 You thinking of speaking with her, boy, you better reconsider 
 Hey, I'm my daughter's keeper 
 And I don't take with the threats, or promises either, nigga 
 You gon' have to see me some day or another 
 And for my blood, bruh, I'm a cold motherfucker 
 (So!) 
 Before you judge me 
 Check yourself before you judge me 
 Hey, shit could get ugly 
 Next time you might not be so lucky 
 What you want from me? 
 What these niggas want from me? 
 This is a, "Don't fuck with me" 
 Hey, think twice before you fuck with me 
 What it is though? 
 2016 Tiller on this shit, so 
 Most likely I'ma vent up on this shit, so 
 Well, um, damn, here it go 
 You see the shit is so new to me, bro 
 Not the music, that's easy, it come smooth to me, bro 
 When I should've been in school, I was making tunes truancy, bro 
 Low-key, them cool kids weren't as cool as me, bro 
 I fell in love and had a mini me, thank you Jesus 
 Ten fingers, ten toes on her pretty feet, seriously, thank you Jesus 
 Pray for it every day in the UPS trailers 
 And you gave her to me like I asked, that's amazing, Jesus 
 I know the saying, give them an inch and they take a mile 
 But Jesus I really need this, I gotta make it out 
 Studio shit on eBay, I gotta purchase 
 I told my niggas, "Lend me 600 dollars, it'll be worth it, let's cop it" (check, check, check, check) 
 So many times I second guessed myself, nigga, I never wanted to be an artist, nah (check, check, check, check) 
 I don't wanna be the centre of attention but I guess I do this shit for the Harley, nah (check, check, check, check) 
 If you know me, you know I just want to be able to walk into Target and people not be astonished 
 Man, let me do my shopping 
 But this in my job, I asked for it, I got it, let's go 
 Just got a new manager, my last one was fucking up my vision 
 Can't believe this nigga still tryna get a percentage 
 I gave you back your investment, get out your feelings 
 Telling people that the money changed me, nigga, the money saved me 
 Nigga, money is the reason that you fuck with me, ain't it? 
 And even though this shit got me angry, I'ma let God fix it 
 'Cause I know if I fix it, my daughter gon' have to grow up without a father figure 
 I'ma end up in prison, wishing I never got into this business 
 It's nothing personal, I made a business decision 
 I might have a job for you if you shape or you could fill the position 
 That's as real as it gets 
 And sometimes I don't know how to deal with this shit 
 I've been searching for the answers in my idol's music 
 In his earlier days, man, I know he went through this 
 He got through this, I'll get through it 
 Before you judge me 
 Check yourself before you judge me 
 Hey, shit could get ugly 
 Next time you might not be so lucky 
 What you want from me? 
 What these niggas want from me? 
 This is a, "Don't fuck with me" 
 Hey, think twice before you fuck with me 
 Check yourself 
 Check, check, check 
 Check, check yourself before you wreck yourself 
 Chiddity-check, check yourself before you wreck yourself 
 Check yourself before you wreck yourself 
 Yeah 
 Check, check yourself before you wreck yourself
