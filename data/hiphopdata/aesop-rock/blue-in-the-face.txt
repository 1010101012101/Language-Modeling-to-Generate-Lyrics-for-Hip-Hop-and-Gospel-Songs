Yo, I surf an axiom kicked in a center fold of ugly tenements 
 Oh Distribute sour inhalants regulate lobby developments 
 Today summon the rug rat oblivious to what's delicate. 
 Tomorrow siphon imperfection out the fetus prior to selling it. 
 There is a brain in the thicket tap circle cupping the port to accord it 
 Teeter thorn storm plunges more but conformers the pouring's half the entry 
 Plated pearly gates enchanted axis with high gentry hinging our binging on public picket fencing 
 Squirming in terms in conditions of un-satisfact destiny magnet 
 Where the ebony should of cracked shit ratio tragic 
 Lose sight suit oh mavericks clash at futility pageants 
 I post froze in a blaze at a grand combustion 
 A leader's deception connection wiper with a barn responds his friend 
 With an eye socket full of needles and a will to die for nothing 
 And that's glory abide thy crass itinerary barely suitable for common slum cats 
 And the lemmings will follow you to the blood bath 
 All aboard that awful train through shames pass where I'd trade my window seat for one pane of replacement stain glass, see I bow to the the gods of opacity 
 I don't mind y'all looking in, its just watching sin city steam slips under my skin 
 And I'm about half way to nausea, half way to contentment 
 2 halves post made a dance evoked a whole lot of resentment 
 Build a pen around master dome patriarch close to four peters 
 Woke to rope cubicles combines with combines suitably ingenious 
 Let's soak my feet in lake infinity the time vibe strapped to dignity my symmetries vivid image still can't mimic the victory comfort is a drug and I'm numb as fuck 
 Yet some prefer the hum and others tend to suck the life out of the crux like 
 1, 2, 3, 4 and I'm a tug dummy hug the hungry pull the lever push the button 
 Drink the garbage split the homage reap the harvest target everyone 
 Mechanized idols that have a malleable colony till the fire ant dropped the sweet leaf grief your dreams a needle in a needle stack claiming safety pin physics 
 Baby tin blizzards collide while ole iron sides trust the rivets 
 I'm sick of the picker the litter soaking the spot lit when I know they know they owe all thanks to the end all Aesop Rock shit watch this 
 Build me a home; build me a home of brick and wood and everything good 
 With a front porch where I can jar fire flies by night and smoke stogs till the day meets twilight, build me a home, build me a home with a green grass hill with running a water in a backyard with a sandbox and a garden of foreign flowers build me a home with a basement and an attic where I can store remnants of the day I once slept in build me a home. 
 No skull is sacred in the races 
 Locked in a pagan doctrine watching born again faces gamble up patience fail blatant 
 Ochre and sienna war paintings stain plague community harking as wrapped 
 It's overlooking out crops. Give you one life to laugh at catalog bliss on the least common attachment 10 seconds of blaring silence pilot's flight redefine stagnant 
 Most emotions host an entire lesson congressional less one stone merely for the exceptional spectacle now listen the pause heed tall forced avoidance of the suit dispersal where the straight and narrow's a perfect circle has-beens fastened to the flip side buy in my grin and clusters that's better than colony my own fathers son is the holy ghost suck that theology I king for a day of peasant for a pleasant life blood on the easel and my eagle eyelids spots runaway pirates look I despise squatters with a oh cry me a river a quarter how'd you afford that dog and sour dialogue I put my hook in the pond I put my worm In the hook I put my trust in the worm that he'd bring me something to cook 
 I felt a tug on my line and I lugged a trash can on my pole with a note from the worm attached that read thanks for nothing asshole simple parables of nature making character giddy and riddle me a similar situation mix city quick put your honor on the line doors to the monks blood thirsty barracuda serpents and report on powers of devil treatment church links I'm a fence sitter lips torn by both polars and their working I can only model throttle at the dream catching matching a patchy holist with a sovereignty harbored and charged my hate breed in a minute he's picket spitting stitches to fix the britches in the gaps one night I broke in bridges give us traps and tried to walk to get stogs just like hop scotch between polar caps and I'm, blue in the face when every second is a waste of breath 
 Making that classic mockery of every step 
 Oh build me a home, build me a home please with a light in the window and a red front door and a picket fence and a fire place and a sturdy frame and we can sit I'll tell you my name build me home.
