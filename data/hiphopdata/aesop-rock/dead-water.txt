This be the dawning of the age of dead water 
 Stitchin every b-boy fragment 
 Somebody live enough to bust through the belly with a fist up 
 This is a right now generation murdered by the fan base 
 This is adored by the writers-Dead water 
 With a still force activated 
 No I'm not feelin' all right 
 Formed by the village of badness and bad karma 
 Punched by the stagnant water gate threw the fickle back 
 But by the window's still three nickels in a piggy bank 
 Caught her with her head up funny stomach from the hunger pains 
 Flashed automatic b-boy with big visions 
 In a matchbox apartment adjacent a crooked starship 
 Doomed and bitter nation and a million's the only remedy 
 Nine dizzy planets with a bullet riding centerpiece 
 Take Me Through The Gates ((I'm) through the gates) 
 I'm bout as sick of burning find the hottest slacker in a visionary costume 
 Con artist kamikaze conduct 
 Warm for a second to the minute he whored herself to disaster 
 I recognize the cankers by the mechanical stagger 
 As opposed to the skip of big brother bad slapper 
 Theologies who need to keep the cookies caffeinated 
 Like a mad hatter that'll sleep now, ask after 
 Calibrate the happy/hacker scale-when he's soakin 
 Wet with a mouthful of better ideas and see if it tipped zero 
 Stripped ego, tall stories of broad glory 
 I'll be god while you're still living life on a full 40 
 Or maybe I'll be gramacin, homes poor, broke and lonely 
 Hidden by my billygoat beard and cardboard monstrosity 
 I drink a bad glass of gumption 
 Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning disgusting 
 Wildchild activater activate sludge enough to dungeon for a accolade and wild ones 
 I committed wild murder, went through the city 
 With a wild merger, woke up in a wildstyle burner 
 Space case, boom box, hate tapes, no lemonade breaks (sweat), no cheddar in labor days 
 Right now, I'm here to break a point of big/bitch system plus my screen 
 I was never cursed in a russmeyer bixon 
 Spit sob stories to confront my dick addictions 
 Of the dirty basement at the graves of Salem witches 
 Driving my stake through the face of painstaking business (dead bait/checkmate) 
 But I scream Misery (better breath take) 
 Out of sleep, lifted up lobotomy, little Jackie paper 
 And a magic dragon sack of dirty shrubbery 
 I'll be the ugliest version of paranoia 
 Kingpin set in motion by the secondhand pressure 
 Some get excited when the sun folds under 
 Some get excited when the summer hits the pavement 
 Some get excited when the bullet hits bone and a board (rather boaring) 
 I'll escape through the train yard and sleep till it's broken 
 (Same old] [same old] [same old] [same old] [same old] [same old] [same old] [same old] [same old] [same old] [same old] [same old] [same old] [same old] [same old] [same old] [same old] [stay alert) 
 This be the settling of debt of warm water 
 A mobile b-boy function 
 Somebody mad enough to cut apart the curtain with a fist up 
 This is the dagger in the 88 magnificent memorial 
 This is the heater to a movement 
 Dead water 
 When I broke to the fifth sparks 
 No I'm not feelin' all right 
 This be the windshear dodgin dead water 
 Solitary b-boy wonder 
 Somebody fresh enough to reinvent the court with a fist up 
 This is the funky outline around a classic breakbeat 
 This is an agitated moment- 
 Dead water 
 With a burnt future, beaten, ugly 
 No I'm not feelin' all right
