On a sunny afternoon in lower east side New York... 
 You about ready? (Yeah) 
 Good morning my sweet vision of morbid disorder 
 And good evening wonderful riddance and such 
 Maybe today I'll touch the burgundy halo 
 Trimming the tunnels and offend with tenants 
 Spangled cross a more tangible premise 
 This splendor shit needs splinters all up in day-tripper visuals 
 Take it easy man, fuck it I'll take it any way I can 
 My palms are generous 
 When I witness fury scurry past my window 
 Model city in a bottle plugged hostile 
 Its bliss kissing polluting 
 And a billion suckers pucker in a bind 
 Maybe the sunken ship is the treasure 
 No, but they insist it man 
 I try to spin me dizzy sponging 
 Spongin up the given dungeons functions 
 As opposed to art historians absorbed inside assumptions 
 Everybody pop your knuckles when the style divorces vertical 
 Marveling at the spite with which it curdled 
 Outside my tenement grows a little warmth 
 From out the mugs of masons wasted 
 Laying bricks for days to later find they owned the lot adjacent 
 Mark the blasphemy elements of elegance and savagery 
 Murder the gossip, fuck it run off happily 
 The broken spoke cyclers choking open doctors they as born fetus 
 In a matchbox conveniently padlocked to the hammer base 
 Now these impurities embedded in five illiterate's textiles 
 Shedded in the hell tale to motivate blind suspended leverage 
 Now I'm drowning in a pool of... why are you here? 
 Sabotage with my beast of burden pertinence of if I die this year 
 My name is Dry spell 
 My name is pillar 
 My name's allegiance 
 My name is flagrant 
 My name's a thousand steps from patience 
 But I'm sick and tired of waiting 
 My name's Polaris 
 My name is canvas 
 My name is lowlife 
 My name's intention 
 My name is every imperfection that plays a part in my dissension 
 My name is carnival 
 My name is posture 
 My name is polarized 
 My name is evidence 
 My name is delicate approach from symmetrically to my fellowship 
 My name's possessive 
 My name is cordial 
 My name is igloo 
 My name is captivate 
 My name is contaminate the rich 
 And clock the profits for the captive's sake 
 Let us hope that the horrors of evil no longer loiter on the doorstep of your past 
 Circle of sandbags drag the shield a meal the meaty hand grabs 
 I'm splitting hopes at your local Acropolis 
 Opulence in a cockpit not the pocket for them born with a pepper toss 
 Sunk to rest while they've exhausted the art of drunken address 
 Exhibit fracture lines that converge towards where the hackers whine 
 Where trappers slack the traps 
 Unlatch the catch then cover up his trackers line 
 That will make his majesty furious 
 Oh bury his head and how could I have been so dense 
 If only, yeah but I'm lonely 
 My days graze normalcy then morbidly crash 
 My years breathe honesty then sardonically laugh 
 Alas, I dig my toes in to the sand and spit foliage out my lips personifying mankind's end all aspirations 
 Hope floats... 
 No, hope sinks like broken boats and most harassed before provoked 
 I'm tossing darts at a map of the arts to pick up where you choked 
 And when the last leaf falls off the branches of resonance 
 I'll be waiting with my butterfly net to collect the evidence 
 Well I am a room with poison oak scaling the sides 
 Arachnids on the ceiling, rugged thumb tacks, bones and rusty pipes 
 If you can squeeze between the bars 
 Enjoy my space employ my waste 
 And change the hand dealt by a stolen grace 
 Do you ever wish the circle was a square 
 So when land sharks start circling the borders 
 You could just cut them off at the corners 
 There's a ghost in the basket of values 
 Pertinent to, which kayak pilot succeeded in serving him proof 
 Now I'm surfing it through 
 So if you need me spread your wings to spell my name 
 Above the mess near the other funny requests 
 See mild to tolerant mannerisms of higher to win 
 To assist in a meticulous pick a part of cobweb of skins 
 Of innocence 
 A child of timid instinct with that ten step ahead premise 
 Supply dust bowls before the zephyr was requested 
 Violent humble shoes ten shades of blues come off the difference 
 I grimace, took me one hours blink to conclude that sickly innocence 
 My name is Dry spell 
 My name is pillar 
 My name's allegiance 
 My name is flagrant 
 My name's a thousand steps from patience 
 But I'm sick and tired of waiting 
 My name's Polaris 
 My name is canvas 
 My name is lowlife 
 My name's intention 
 My name is every imperfection that plays a part in my dissension 
 My name is carnival 
 My name is posture 
 My name is polarized 
 My name is evidence 
 My name is delicate approach from symmetrically to my fellowship 
 My name's Possessive 
 My name is cordial 
 My name is Igloo 
 My name is captivate 
 My name is contaminate the rich 
 And clock the profits for the captive's sake 
 My name is vagabond 
 My name is angel 
 My name is century 
 My name is hunter 
 My name is sunburst 
 My name is wildfire 
 My name is scrutinize 
 My name is basic 
 My name is consequence 
 My name is cigarettes 
 My name is cynical 
 My name is tolerance 
 My name's hallucinogen 
 My name is waterfall 
 My name is runaway 
 My name is alarm clock 
 My name is...
