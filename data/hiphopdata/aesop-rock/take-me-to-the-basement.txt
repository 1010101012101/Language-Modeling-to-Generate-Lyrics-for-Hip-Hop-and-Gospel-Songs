Take me to the basement 
 Let me count the holes in your foundation 
 Ancient ridicule system alert, kissing my lurk 
 The perch of rare grimace on iron mask 
 I remember science class 
 If chemistry could silence the lions laugh I'd be fine 
 (I fail tah) molindone up 
 Adrenaline trades the leaves that walk the plank 
 Before the crimson struck a match this season 
 Meridian carpal will jolt your logic 
 When the burn earned its self normalcy for 20 plus 
 Run amok or sink, swims not an option 
 She applied the lipstick slow 
 Slow enough for me to bask in 
 Fast enough for me to wish it lasted 
 Past my alarms cackling 
 The front line of its mystique's geek 
 Doubled my proposals, bargains 
 For the ogers who prefer the roller coasters 
 (I prefer the roller coasters) 
 Well that'll sip the blood of merry men 
 That'll grace holiday carols when the merry ends 
 Barrel past the auto craft, exhale into final raft 
 And pirate your local rain puddle torturous 
 Try to shake pilot fish off your dorsal fin 
 Lets dive through the archives, synax on frantic? 
 Stamp it with a notable brand to reek the profit 
 See I don't know hell but I've read about it often 
 Sounds like a dope concept gone wrong 
 (Note to caution) 
 Take Me to the basement 
 Lets zoom into that war paint sensation 
 Take Me to the basement 
 Lets dis-sable the cause rotation 
 Sayin', if you choose to build or you'll die by the tools you build with 
 So make some noise for all your predecessors reppin dirty grill-age 
 Take Me to the basement 
 Lets deny the nervous rooms of pacin' 
 Take Me to the basement 
 Lets review the hearts ramifications 
 Sayin', if you choose to build or you'll die by the tools you build with 
 So make some noise for all your predecessors reppin sturdy grill-age 
 Take me to the basement 
 Lets remove the costume you escaped in 
 Hold up your legacies, I'll tell you which ones my favorite 
 Hold up your elacerative innocence 
 I'll teach you about the perks of patience in seminar format 
 I've worn that hat for seven years 
 That's why its discolored, ragged and shitty 
 I ain't about to toss when it's been through all these dream wars with me 
 Ima undercover profit, thrift shop god 
 I rather starve then sit inside this gridlock till it parts 
 This tailor made rutiny ain't suitin me 
 It's tied around my neck like 13 loops rafter an apple box 
 Heartless harvest of mine, I'm tired of pissin benediction 
 Maybe it ain't healthy, but sometimes I rather burn then let you help me 
 It's getting brisk, brisk as fuck 
 My skin ain't thick enough, these icicles ain't civil 
 How many freezer burn victims can one society on tilt manufacture 
 Prior to hire, being intervening just to release last laughter 
 And every tree trunks made of third rails with tourniquet branches 
 And I learned to walk with an anchor in my back pocket 
 And man I read palms during even the most brief handshakes 
 And man I ain't alive to pull the weeds around the spotlit 
 Well I'm wallowin, followin my little lost princess to the promise land 
 Hollerin my potent slogan, hell if Nostradamus can 
 Conquering these open roads with throttle pin to floor 
 Cause Ima win right after I finish these chores 
 Take Me to the basement 
 Lets zoom into that war paint sensation 
 Take Me to the basement 
 Lets dissable the cause rotation 
 Sayin', if you choose to build or you'll die by the tools you build with 
 So make some noise for all your predecessors reppin sturdy grillage 
 Take Me to the basement 
 Lets deny the nervous rooms of pacin' 
 Take Me to the basement 
 Lets review the hearts ramifications 
 Sayin', if you choose to build or you'll die by the tools you build with 
 So make some noise for all your predecessors reppin sturdy grillage
