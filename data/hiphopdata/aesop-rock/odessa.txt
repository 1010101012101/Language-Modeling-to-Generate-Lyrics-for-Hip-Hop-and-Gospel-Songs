 Listeners,

 Aesop:

 The uprooted turned moody and hacked pleasure to skinny ribbons and I'll suckle my skull caught beneath assumptions pumping pistons...

 Grey, lonely, this forest is very very different, 
 Friend hail things like magnets all the way meant was, [it only takes one slacker] traveling up, it only takes one slacker 
 Aesop: 
 It only takes one slacker, to attack alacrity, in complience with time with regulations poachers poaching just to jump the batteries, 
 I'm juiced, noosed by the notice, seduced by the ambiance of motives and the modus operandi's 
 I'll support it, sort of here to modify those monsters tried to sidewind pleasure captains round my hip line, 
 My sit times on some here I lay my bricks alone to build these walls among us dreams can spread our spores but can I run with the alumnus fungus, 
 After date rape, and it churns, and I burn for less fortunate starlight chasers forced to use their last match to ward off the glaciers

 Aesop: 
 My zero hour snuffed doc, where the marked the day the mirth burns 
 The time allotted, knotted loops around the plotted, boycotted the wattages, toys for the prodding of the rotting bottled hostage, 
 One time down cloud me as the useless playtime string and think it smirked worthy well, you're with me, from the icicle sweat to the self pity 
 Sickly thread bare slid back my needle point life willow, man I purposely spun straw to gold to lace each last stitch perfectly 
 It must have been the dust, the dust, my god the dust he clutched the dust, father to rust encrust the luck with which I touch togetherness... 
 Dose: 
 Toy, bird, In my teeth, empathy, dwell, in merciful spring, friend
