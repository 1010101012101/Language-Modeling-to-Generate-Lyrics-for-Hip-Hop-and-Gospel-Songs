(Good Evening) 
 (Happy to be Breathing) 
 (I am Alive) 
 (Yeah) 
 (Fuck You) 
 (Like you've seen a ghost) 
 Most copious, 
 Brain soaked the opiates. 
 Notice to the phobias: 
 Appropriately procreate. 
 Woke up with a ghost farm, 
 Focused on his groceries, 
 When they aren't telling stories 
 They are multiplying grossly on the lawn. 
 Let 'em loiter, never let 'em spawn... 
 The abhorritions have been drinkin' this water for too long. 
 So when they gather by the birdbath in the morning you can tell 'em: 
 "I mean no disrespect but you have all outstayed your welcome" 
 Interesting in a sense... 
 Interrupt commiserating phantoms on your picket fence, 
 How quickly they will lift their heads... 
 And breathe an ultimatum like the dead don't argue. 
 Said: "You're living by the bayonet, but how alive are you?" 
 Shit, 
 Haggis, old juice, and bad ettiquette. 
 Elbows on the table, lobster bib on and on the ready set he said 
 "But how alive?" 
 "I dunno homie, you decide" 
 Fine 
 How alive? 
 Too alive 
 How alive? 
 Too alive 
 How alive? 
 Too alive... 
 And one by one, around the yard 'til each one felt communal pride 
 Like they had done their little part in cleaning up the public... 
 With a steaming plate of justice for them East Baker stomachs. 
 (Say what?) 
 We the legends at home with the unremembered. 
 Geriatric lurin' the clutch of the budding censored, 
 Who snuck around the art police and all related governments 
 To infiltrate a human lung and hike up off his tongue and lip! 
 Ah, the money's in the market for a mothership; 
 To double as a vessel to drag its legacy under it. 
 And who am I to hang 'em out to dry by the heap? 
 When, if rehydrating fails, we're all dumber because of me... 
 Zombies of the antiquated nation chatter quietly, 
 The too alive channel from the library of rivalry. 
 And summer is in the mud, 
 Winter is by the tracks, 
 No story goes untold, 
 Aes is back! 
 I got a handful rockin' the same poker face 
 Gonna dance around the table like they own the place. 
 I got the whole world thinkin' it's a holiday 
 'Cause they can smell the chum in the water from miles away. 
 You 
 You 
 You 
 You 
 You 
 You 
 You look like you've seen a ghost. 
 How alive? too alive. 
 How alive? too alive. 
 How alive? too alive. 
 How alive? too alive. 
 How alive? too alive. 
 How alive? too alive. 
 How alive? too alive. 
 How alive? too alive.
