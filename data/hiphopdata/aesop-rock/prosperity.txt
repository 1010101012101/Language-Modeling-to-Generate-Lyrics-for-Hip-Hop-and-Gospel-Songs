Sulking and bulking a half 
 Sulking a laugh crash test 
 Figure the mixtures digging up his last breath 
 Grief leaf thief briefly turned chieftan 
 The tapwater is on the waters off the waters leaking 
 So this is blue 
 My frame reportedly spotted garden variety burners and lost to normalcy 
 My terms the memoir obligation in the boodoir crystalize impurities to zero on the 
 Autograph dirty catapult sponges my hunches hurling murder abundant lunches with the 
 City suppers punching (hurdling) tomorrow since I sit in consquence merging brings to 
 Bubble up along the edges of precious child fantasy broken hi, my name is hazardous 
 Tobaccanist I'm hung on the brink I'm purgin dirt and spit my lung in the sink as for the 
 Product well its drenched in a barren backward wasteland of shimmering moral tension 
 And venturing the plaza pleasant I saw it all from pixie dust to crepid pins and 
 Voodoo dolls and 99 dreams later the shooting gallery wall it's like not a wave crash 
 Similar to last or next heckle me not already doctored by regrets gray rain 
 Beligerant fragments bomb acid ushering the pixels till the image burned classic 
 Bliss in a barrel and motivation in a basket ima cast it out to sea and wait for my 
 Comma to grasp it I left my crutch over the rainbow with my riches and I know the rat 
 Race of the bad taste once his grimmace cringes an iron butterfly will float if given 
 Good condition but I'm still fishing the same worm from the same faulty position 
 Prosperity 
 I'm tryin' to walk alone and miss the bliss inide the accidental meeting of the pencil 
 And the ceiling and the censures started meeting breathing at a rappid calibur at 
 That a line so gray will last forever more dusting off the dreams to be an autopilot 
 Still a silent understudy funny how the opposite will throttle and the different 
 Stroke and model to the prison is innacurate portrayal of an addequate betrayal of a 
 Wish gonna wanna coulda shoulda woulda did it isn't it amusing choosing and a plan of 
 Cybernating waiting till the mating means of motivation took a fine posistion dishing 
 Only after every little kiddy has performed I just wanna be a general he said I just 
 Wanna I just wanna I just wanna be a general he said I just wanna sleep yo what a 
 Long capitol crust gallop my charriot burning and aweful enigma sprung by the sling 
 Of david appears gutterbug batch prior to hatch dismiss it as a soul condensing 
 Excuse to decorate maps with thumb tacks this gold star product pushing hate boogie 
 Themes enter the smoke screen blazing saddle remnants alive analyze pensive connect 
 All picket fences like chain gangs linked digging trenches to candy land image 
 Factory sold ah I wanna be an astronaut I got the merits and heart and I bought a 
 Starship with hard earned money from one hour selling dreams to dummies when they 
 Raise the lights ja ja ja Jesus Christ I've never seen so many goblins in my life (oh 
 My lord) vibrate through the fog and then some dragging bent circuits on a short 
 Leash like organ grinder primates dancing for bread crumbs well did you touch that 
 Slugger banging on the table with an old tin cup thin luck I can raise the dead when 
 The shark settlers fled the place sprung out they bed of nails to spread the sails 
 Racing for milk and bread but I got big big plans I ride a big boat with a big ol 
 Motor and I ain't really that big on helping you turn your leaf over (lets sing) bring 
 Out your dead a quarter pile sky high (lets see) run if your miserable saw the plant 
 Fly by my name is try to deny magnificent doom craft my ragged soul built and ima show
