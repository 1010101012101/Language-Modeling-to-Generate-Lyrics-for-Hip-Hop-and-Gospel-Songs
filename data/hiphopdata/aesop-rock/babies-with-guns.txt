 This is how the city folk and mole people connect 
 Somebody warp the message right I'll pass it to the next 
 Now the perforated county's making you upset 
 Harvest all brand x clark kents to worm pool 
 Carbon heart 
 Buried his nozzle in fossil marker art 
 Pardon 
 Cadaver had a legitimate pulse 
 And littered volts are with the village 
 Where the skittish pigeons molt 
 Bastard poacher gasped 
 With the pigeon with lazarus billy goat whiskers 
 He rose to see salt in the open blisters but 
 Blind anarchy slips through the cracks, 
 See naked martyrs with Bubblicious on fishing rods 
 Itching to pull it back 
 With that organic invention incubated to hatch 
 Some can try to make it fructose on paper now 
 Allow the details later and the crews will taper out 
 Of wooly mayors ousts? 
 Through piggy jammy happy shooting at the bladed mouth 
 Bazooka tooths who keep the paper route 
 With janky funds and favors 
 Cradled by twelve empty Zelda heart containers 
 Man, it's freezing in this brick bitch 
 Winter forever 
 Like Punxsutawney Phil down with his four furry wrists severed 
 I walk face first through the sex, guns, and church 
 With wild things that make Maurice Syndek question his early works 
 But no hostages no promises 
 Out the claw of corporate cogs and sprockets, 
 Now clogs off gromits 
 Running from a rabid ring wraith click, basilisk, serpentine 
 In and out of traffic jam and murder scenes 
 Scrub blood off the AF1 fifty two pick up first degree 
 Some toddler's smuggled tommy guns and crack into the nurseries 
 Dogg, there's a fucking baby at the door asking for wallets 
 And those ain't twin beenie babies inside his pockets 
 2010 sonograms show the magnums form directly off the fetus 
 Evolution for the young killer convenience

 Magazine, check check, paper route, check check 
 This is how the hermit inc. and busy bee connect 
 Somebody's losing track of their flesh and blood in arrests 
 Polka dotted landscapes what did you expect? 
 Now-a-days even the babies got guns 
 Diaper snipers having clock-tower fun 
 Misplace the bottle might catch a bad one 
 Have a mid-life crisis when you're ten years young 
 Hold up 
 If the Jesus piece around your neck is bigger than your pistol 
 It makes homicide okie-dokie and your god will forgive you 
 Just show the saints at heaven's gate you should be on the list 
 I hear overlooks manslaughter for a tattooed crucifix 
 Twisty, fidgety, contradicting 
 Wild animal shit bleed off the slide of born doctor? 
 To mister turnable mind bought? 
 Somewhere to laminate dry bones in cool water and ease medulla 
 After you thumb sucking diaper chains 
 Give birth and shoot the school up 
 I duel, too, but only to exploit no-brainers 
 Teenager beef past alligator teeth 
 And extra-curricular flagpole scrappin' 
 Amongst tadpoles that have yellow backbones 
 Team mechanism brought airborne shrapnel scraps to hassle captain 
 By the itchy index of an umbilically garped fraggle baby 
 Fragile, maybe, ya think 
 Chop shop and a misled maladjusty crusty lock box 
 Hiding clips that light the sky in seconds 
 Like dueling communal hopscotch gives them leverage 
 Cut 'em with mortars 
 While I mumble in the immortal slang of Mush Mouth 
 For the anti-lead nirvana 
 I used to think I'd get hit by a bus or something dumb and dumber 
 Now the bus is slugs plugged by the newest kiddie thug wonder 
 Suffered through kingsley 
 Rep a wide pride dosage 
 For tomorrow the holsters are bound to outnumber the roaches 
 Not a coach, but that'll even jolt the immobile 
 When global terrorism's all the rage your folk get smoked local 
 Block[head], if you need me, I had to bounce to d.c. 
 To bullet-proof mom's flower garden 
 Before the war cheats me 
 If I'm not back in a week tell the crew I said "peace, and lay low" 
 Strains don't vacate slow

 Have a mid-life crisis when you're ten years young 
 Aboard the battleship, gray sky, the day i 
 Got the phone call Jam Master Jay died 
 So, no, I'll probably never write another daylight 
 Because the stingers tend to cling more than a portable hay rides 
 It adds up when a pioneer fall 
 In comparison to your ninety-nine bottles of beer wall 
 There's banana peels in your hamster wheels 
 Hand cannons in your shoebox, please 
 Mine's got adidas, rest in peace... get at me.
