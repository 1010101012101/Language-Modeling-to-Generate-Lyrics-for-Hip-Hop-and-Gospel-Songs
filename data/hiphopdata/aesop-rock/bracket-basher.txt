Hey yo must not sleep 
 I bash the bracket open and breach 
 The priority's bleached since that '76 umbilical severed 
 Majority's cordially aboard the pinnacle benders 
 I got west nile virus on my TV in the Bronx 
 I got two hollow pockets and a sleepy hollow mosh pit 
 Tryin' to blow the spot with wet matches and bottle rockets 
 While cop walkie talkies walk outside my apartment obnoxious 
 Tonight's special consists of stale fiber from shitty diners 
 Look mom! I learned to tie my shoes! Hey can I borrow twenty bucks? 
 Peel back the prickly cocoon a Poloroid turbulent land unit birth 
 Student first pedagogue only from brazen action 
 Wind blown mariner east river shark carry lunge carry funk ends on caliber 
 Watch war face painted junkies dance blissfully around a bonfire and 
 Sacrifice life's sanity Pay a nickel for nose-bleed seats in a peanut gallery 
 Gallop with a Pegasus, malice with no benefits, balance with some sense of bliss in the foulest degenerates, my New Year's revolution's gon' be to stop burning bridges 
 I'm just 'gon bend 'em toward the couple cats that's worth the visits 
 Um, it's like that, and that's the way Aes stinks, and um 
 Plans are like clipper ships, if they got holes they sink 
 And if the skipper slips the crew shits bricks, wither, and hits the brink 
 That's why I take the poison spitter sips and smile big when I drink 
 You never knew mayhem walked with Nikes talked like a trucker hawk the filibuster Gerber baby lucid Colonel Mustards 
 No time to hold my breath, I'm only here to rap, eat, sleep, grow old, and smoke stoges through the hole in my neck. 
 New millennium, mad cows and Pentium, process the hostage, lock him in the petting bin 
 Showing pictures of his wife and kids, then wash the brain 
 Probably the same motherfuckers that buffed the train 
 (x2) 
 Ok ok ok ok ok ok 
 Must not sleep 
 Must bash the bracket 
 Pay The Rent, Pay The Debt 
 Must slash the fabric 
 Catch the jackrabbit 
 Pay The Rent, Pay The Debt 
 Sleep 
 Roll into the city with one half of the cannibals. 
 New joint bumpin out the whip speakers 
 Made the escape for a night of makin' tapes now it's back to the cockroaches and preachers 
 Somewhere a prom queen's givin' birth in a bathroom stall 
 Holding a prime directive not to get blood on her mother's ballgown 
 I'm son of a stubborn old one track jackal prince 
 Trucking with prime directive just to get the goods and never fall down [Raw bomber] 
 Ate the city spit the bricks ate the boxcar spit the burners 
 Ate the planet spit the murder 
 Funny farm rampage from writing rap for milk money built ugly 
 But a couple side effects to make'em love me 
 My cipher demeanor left Jesus rubbin genie bottles 
 Till the following morning Colombo found a crown of thorns in urine puddles 
 You're in trouble 
 I'm not trying to save the world I'd rather watch it die slow 
 So I could spit my grand I-told-you-so 
 Are we having fun yet? 
 Yup. Step to the carnies 
 Try to win a teddy bear to impress your favorite Barbie 
 She almost sucked you off at the company Christmas party 
 But she won't accept the bear till Aesop signs it with a sharpie 
 My ex-girl bounced without payin' the cable bill 
 I check myself in television rehab 
 Withdrawal symptoms may include shivering, fevers, drooling and chronic masturbation 
 Now I pray to the gods of pornography and Playstation 
 Now I lay me down to sleep 
 I pray the lord my soul to keep 
 And if I should die before I wake 
 Give my ASR to El and bury me with my mistakes 
 (x2) 
 Ok ok ok ok ok ok 
 Must not sleep 
 Must bash the bracket 
 Pay The Rent, Pay The Debt 
 Must slash the fabric 
 Catch the jackrabbit 
 Pay The Rent, Pay The Debt 
 Sleep 
 Bonus Round 
 This is the hot tin roof stepper 
 Hold it down with centipede foundation 
 Mr. Greed who burns rugged obstruction in bunches 
 Like little Jackie paper puffs the magic dragon and dutches 
 We don't need another hero hommie gallop off on you're my little one trick pony 
 Holly Hobbie Polly Pocket pretty future destiny 
 If the slipper fits fire up Cinderella propeller and curtsie for the munchkins right before 
 Aesop Rock smashed the pumpkin 
 Iron on gusto rustolium bloodstream what's better? 
 When the wrist slit it leaks out only the bloodiest bubble letters 
 Complete with outlines, fill-ins, dates, shading and shout out columns 
 For vagrant colonies to follow in redeeming bottles 
 You're a little tea pot tryin' to eavesdrop on the mammoth route 
 Peekin' out from around the rose bush like... here is my handle... here is my spout 
 Godzilla junkie used to be in love, now out for gigapussy 
 Sorry to offend but sometimes life bends in the middle 
 So now you have a fulcrum where there used to be a pillar 
 And now I got a pulse that bumps less than a cocaine binger 
 And now I got no 9 to 5 and still labor days flicker 
 And now I got a 9mm Q-tip with an itchy trigger finger 
 See, I really don't feel your persona distortion ordered by martyrs who martyr self for martyr's sake 
 Wow fame... If notoriety grew adjacent a jealous dick-riding sentiments I'd give you a pound like "Greetings Mr. President." 
 Now go do your homework
