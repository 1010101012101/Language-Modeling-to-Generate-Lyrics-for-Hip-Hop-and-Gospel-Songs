This is labor labor labor labor 
 (Labor labor labor labor) 
 Who put the monkey wrench in well oiled perfectionist emblem 
 Just to watch these monitors spit white noise 
 Through your office space automate 
 I infect knowledge gene pool dissented cloud clusters 
 Brushing dust mites off your starborn all revolution sound jugglers 
 Delinquent fan for brick habitat bob, weave, stick, move fence 
 And pause somewhere in the middle for slick invention 
 This years brain crop spread spectacular 
 I ain't mad at cha don't stay mad at the caliber 
 I twist characters like twist characters 
 Talley up the alley cat aggression 
 In this Doug E. Fresh infested mess up bassline lust 
 An automatic B-boy krylon can't combust circuits 
 Working these war picked ciphers 
 With head striker stability and kamikaze chivalry 
 I alone noble in a worm food feud 
 Walking dead generation ain't nobody asking for your patience 
 The grand opening holding me to face the fact 
 That I knew myself and didn't have to ask nobody else 
 (Talk about labor) Fantastic planet urchin putting work in 
 Searching for pertinent verse minus the murderous diversions 
 Apologies won't lore me to the communal sob story 
 Nor would I sacrifice lifestyle to benefit jury temperament 
 This whole Green Goblin webcutter butts up against 
 Crayola daydream landscapes spittin' bedlam, Datum 
 Charge the villagers nickles and nicotine 
 To watch them fed to one disgruntled crack at the high noon 
 (We sell popcorn, beer and balloons!) 
 I got an inkling this gon be the one that children bicker over 
 And start warriors vs. baseball fury element 
 To glitches motor sensory development 
 I am a star really! The big bang bastard's back 
 With a one way ticket to Beat Street 
 This soil is like relevant to human concept 
 Plot the man ratios man learning, I work past the service 
 I work on what I love, I work the service on my burdens 
 And I work till this here little flat line closes the curtains
