Yo... I take ten steps with a bent left vision, 
 Study the disorders we've absorbed inside the village, 
 I understand the plagues and while they shake hands with my grimace 
 That remains up in my face like top to bottom train car fill-ins 
 Let's question the ascension of a broken social icon in various domino affects 
 Imma blow this hex over the mission 
 Just to administer the end-all sucker punch for what its pitiful condition. 
 (C-Ray Walz) 
 With no alibi love is used as a guide by the civilized 
 Some see it as the body heat you feel when you close your eyes 
 That's so much of a lie, you can leave you hair dyed and scorched you roots 
 As the truth hits your ears begin to cry 
 "Why is it like this?!" Why the fuck do I care? 
 I don't have the answers, or at least the ones you want to hear 
 City lights look bright groups of fireflies 
 Many see the truth (the proof) only when the liar dies 
 Tires screech to a halt, the ground cries 
 Spit sparks speak to the streets 
 The skid marks are replies 
 Read discussions of what we rode through entrenched in the vocals 
 The hopeless stay hopeful (the toxic fumes choke you) 
 As I walk out my door, step into the pollution 
 I breathe in the problems, exhale solutions 
 Physically the situation's hard to stop 
 I had a wicked jump shot and sold crack rock on back blocks 
 Casualties in this apocalypse (street chronicle) 
 Abnormal abdominals (push-up phenomenal) 
 Relaxin' drinkin' my 6-pack maxing 
 Faxing my thoughts on the satellite, via Donahue (push it) 
 Table talk, salt and pepper conversation 
 Integrated sectors, metropolis and mecca 
 It's a conspiracy (you know), I can't lie dukes 
 Sometimes I feel the rats got a better deal than I do. 
 (Aesop Rock) (Chorus) 
 It goes thieves, bandits, lowlives, scum 
 Punks that buckle under the rumble of my drum 
 Steadily searching for something new under the sun 
 But its stagnant, act of developing burst of madness 
 It goes thieves, bandits, lowlives, scum 
 Punks that buckle under the rumble of my drum 
 Steadily searching for something new under the sun 
 But it's hurtin', act of developing first of diversion 
 (C-Rayz Walz) 
 A new universe is ancient, so I stay patient 
 In a gravel pit, travelin' thoughts and ravelin', pacing 
 Embracing light of America, and found a shade of darkness (underground) 
 The train car used to be my apartment 
 Sick of people rushin' in the doors before I get out 
 Conductors closing the doors before I get in, I shout 
 "The Biz is coming, The Biz is coming!" 
 Don't get worried now 
 We've been in a cold world 
 We just getting flurries now? 
 (Aesop Rock) 
 Yeah, it's like slooow dowwn, 
 You're movin' much too fast to bust through the finale fashioned glass 
 It's delicate demeanor and I teach you how to hang 
 But we like 19 7-something 20 clicks outside Da Nang 
 Dear obedience I apologize for the faulty academics 
 But they placed us in a miserable stasis 
 I let bygones be bygones 
 But tryin' to see eye to eye with the faceless 
 Just ain't working the way the manual paints it 
 See I soak in a blue note factory 
 While most cats hassle bandits lamping solo 
 And when the last red brick topples over the earth 
 To intercept your crooked little mess 
 I can be found in a social coma directly to your left 
 Engaged in a conversation, a marvel with my breath 
 Regarding how to document the shady baby steps 
 I bounce checks like a modern man 
 Sleep with one eye open while the other two drift 
 Together specimens from the promised land 
 This' for the thinkers 
 This' for the urchins allergic to they own stingers 
 This' for the absurd verdict linkers 
 This for that cat at my shows that's always got prophetic opinions 
 But can't remember where his drink is. 
 I'm wallowing, shrugging I'm plugging your corporation 
 'Cause we alley cats addicted to the sickly warped sensation 
 Answer this: when all is said and done 
 Are you a memorable troop or just a lab rat on the run
