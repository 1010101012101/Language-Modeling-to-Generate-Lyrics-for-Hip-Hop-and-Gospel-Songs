Parachute ratty 
 One bunk chord, now the air is scooped badly 
 Dripping out the sticks like a twig tweed hammock 
 Miter cut the cables for that quick, clean transit 
 Miser tuck the big screen panic near the business card 
 Ankle out of whack 
 Painkiller debacle 
 Scrappy navigate the yellow corn height for the barn when the spot light swivel hard right over the farm 
 Post up 
 3 cheers for the gimp sprint, thank you 
 Limp to the door, splint what he mangled 
 Oh yeah, I knew the percentages but the numbers were unaware of the grand finale's emphasis 
 And over the scent of a thousand dead dogs Agent Zip Zooka swore to pull it off 
 Game face 
 Walkie-talkie squawking off his hip regarding paratrooper's 20 
 Tug a noise box trigger, reporting for hunting. 
 I have landed safely 
 I have not received my papers 
 I have zero natural enemies 
 I don't know my location 
 I have no training in reconnaissance, combat or colluding 
 I'm calling for my orders, over 
 'Strap on a helmet and start shooting!' 
 Klonopin to kill a horse, numb and blood thirsty 'til the 'uncle' spitter beg a jungle pig to hug mercy 
 Two 40-below shitkickers tickle the corpses 
 Duck, the widow maker also manufactures orphans 
 Manufactures ordanance, if it moves stick a fork in it 
 Winners take all, killers rape all coordinates 
 Unfortunately courted by the most tenacious guardians whose aimless nature bait a harlequin to taste the martyr skin 
 No semper fi 
 No saluter unit, soldier, the fire is more flesh than sulfur 
 And when the automatic jitters wiggle the ribs, I feel so alive it don't matter which bitches litter is clipped 
 Sun down, goggle up 
 Canteen, gobble juice 
 Tear gas, nozzle up 
 Brain buff, hostile youth 
 Chop it up 
 Lock a noose upon it 
 You will die for the glory of... 
 Shit I can't put my finger on it but it's big 
 Big and legitimate, justify women and kiddy killer shit; iller it builds 
 So he is not a natural predator but could dismantle an AK-47, clean and rebuild before you could mayday brethren 
 Muddy gut, snake eyes 
 He approaches cobras with an ugly muck and bloody bowie knife clamped in the canines 
 Wake 'em with that blind military mechanism set to bludgeon 
 What is your major malfunction 
 I have landed safely 
 I have not received my papers 
 I have zero natural enemies 
 I don't know my location 
 I have no training in reconnaissance, combat or colluding 
 I'm calling for my orders, over 
 'Strap on a helmet and start shooting!' 
 I'm standing at attention 
 With a pocket full of weapons. 
 And the will to walk a mile 
 In the same fatigues that I slept in. 
 I have yet to find a day in life worthy of my saluting. 
 I'm calling for my orders, over. 
 'Strap on a helmet and start shooting!' 
 I shimmy up out of the foxhole, disorderly, only after having logged every cadaver accordingly 
 High scores keep automatons enthralled 
 There is no cause iller than no cause at all 
 Okay, if his perspective is merc'd, sneaky detective work is aborted 
 And it's no longer whisper mode on the red alert 
 No bed of dirt sniper rifle peaking out the bunker 
 Now I'm center city looking for something to puncture 
 Help me up the numbers or the hero status suffers, 
 Treat the public like a tin can riddled before it plummets, 
 But adrenaline could lead to lazy eye hassles 
 So he missed the little boy and 
 Took the the pin out the pineapple 
 That's funny 
 Bumps into the steel toe 
 That's lovely 
 Sum it up in 'aw, hell no' 
 And just as quick as the parachute cable snipped, 
 I was rag doll horizontal; 
 Two limbs short of fixed. 
 Leak a baby pool around the standard issue weaponry 
 While fading as a blemish in civility's memory, 
 They will step over the body for the looting... 
 (Ready on the firing line.) 
 (What the fuck was that?)
