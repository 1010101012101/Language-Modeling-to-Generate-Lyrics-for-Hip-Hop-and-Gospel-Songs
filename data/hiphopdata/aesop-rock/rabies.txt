Hey warm cider, barn full of spiders 
 Orange moon, starry night, particle exciters 
 In a pageant rivaled only by the origin of fire 
 Now add an organism from alternative environs 
 A dozen pair of cartoon eyes in a thicket 
 To see a neophyte get sliced into ribbons 
 Some here to pick lice off each other and assimilate 
 Duck a suit troubleshoot his moody user interface 
 Chewing suckerproof flew to fully disengage 
 Float his only vanishing point away from the picture plane 
 Go to where the radio trails off 
 And people catch rabies on the way to their mailbox 
 Under a sideways rain cornering the briar 
 Still pull a broadsword from a hoarded synthesizer 
 Nap in a hole in a tree 
 Cat leaving voles at my feet 
 Talking Master P, memory foam everything 
 Jettison the rest and roulette us a new trajectory 
 Spinal Tap eleven, tapping resin out the evergreen 
 Designated dark horse, headless independently 
 Sidewalks end with ponds and frog eggs 
 Buried bones in his very own blurry sasquatch vids 
 Led light fueled ants to a hot lens 
 Eight o clock kittens vs cobwebs; fight 
 Maps won't work here 
 Ice over bittersweet nightshade 
 Antlers rise from his migraine 
 Shred or die; life's strange 
 How do you identify? 
 Knew it from a (?) or peckish with a Vespertine 
 Me? I'm pretty useless 
 Till the roof is painted Gemini to set him free 
 Eat his own body weight in genocide 
 Who came back a decorated dog of war 
 Who wants more though he currently stuck in the dog door 
 Additionally, "dog" isn't even his final form 
 Just a period between greenhorn and hyperion 
 Peer into the eye of a primordial experience 
 Portamento warriors and unforgiving wilderness 
 Borderline ethereal noah's ark roll tone 
 Add a little up high downlow too slow 
 Found acquaintances a pain to babysit 
 So he gave away his shit and gave 'em all the slip 
 Now pets hit the ceiling when the wind blows 
 Fish float belly up song birds crash in the windows 
 Swizzle apple cider vinegar and dish soap 
 Suicide flies take dips in the killzone 
 Still shuffle through a stack of old photos 
 Taken before the vericose verified chronos 
 I don't know it feels weird 
 I'd rather feed an apple to a deer 
 I might've heard something in the walls 
 Could've been voices 
 Could've been claws 
 Could've been the rebel yell 
 Or something more involved 
 Pounding on the front door and standing on the lawn like 
 "What up?" 
 Ain't shit
