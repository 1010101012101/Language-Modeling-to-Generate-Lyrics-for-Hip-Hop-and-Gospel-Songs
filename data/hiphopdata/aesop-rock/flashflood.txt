'We'll have more news after this commercial word' 
 (So it goes...) 
 'At least I think I was here asleep... 
 Is it possible, conceivable that I sleepwalked out of my 
 Apartment 
 And went berserk?' 
 (Aesop Rock) 
 In slipped rhythm 
 Fed a cycle bound by dilemma-debting vendetta 
 Escaped briefly back to my apartment 
 I parked in front the fan 
 And reminisce about the day I ran a mile with your heart in my 
 Hand 
 'Tesants get the New York home game 
 With real life shoot-em-up action 
 Thug, vagrant, yuppie, and art 
 Free game piece all included 
 I told this cat the earth was flat 
 He walked till his beard grew long enough to strangle himself 
 For being stupid 
 Brick-a-brak novelty 
 Spliced with that sixth pack odyssey 
 Godspeed Tequila worm future, be concerned 
 My feelings spread across the land reporting avalanche sightings 
 While my introverted side is flying cadavers on kite strings 
 I'ma never give, I'm juiced off ejection 
 I'm stubborn as a thousand born-against avoiding questions 
 From the alpha to the zed 
 I bake the date up for my pledge 
 To 'bay the traitor in the twice-forgotten favors that he bled 
 Not a creature stirred, it reeks of subway metal 
 Bevel-edge journalist chin on fish shenanigans 
 Recording mayhem with bonuses, benefits and break room 
 Mummified mannequins with future cleanse adamant 
 And skeleton in cabinet 
 This amalgam circus, got a ring of fire 
 Just big enough to shove my purpose in a circle 
 I'm known to dip dusk in a broken city curfew 
 Release the hounds and see which one can tractor trail and serve you (SUCKA!) 
 I lay the law down upon its belly 
 With my foot dug in between the third and fourth disk 
 Yelling 'Break yo'self!' 
 I'm the actualized data commission 
 Past penny tip jar donation arrangement 
 Rather far-fetched from stability 
 Took a heart pledge early on 
 Bled onto the drum doser 
 Plow in the metronome, home 
 Lone caddy corner to cock-eyed sound booster 
 Sensationally seismograph stabbin away on stone tablets 
 To sketch up out your future 
 I drifted out the main spelunking unit with watered down sand 
 But have canceled developed, courtesy America 
 Land of the free base 
 Home of the triplicate grill character 
 My sorta sideways tilt called pinball blinker 
 It citizens wander through ex-warrants steady bleed 
 With dilapadated winter jacket 
 I rock a crooked lid piece 
 A sweat a bit to make my Wookie ends meet 
 Pacifist willing to step into a friend's beef if needed 
 Wing clipper, I hierarch compassionate 
 Where they whine on some 'Daddy's gonna kill Ralphy' shit 
 Sucked the proverbial silver spoon to the parents quit 
 Apparently 
 Parasol spinnin casually like 'I'm an artist, please don't laugh 
 At me' 
 Ok, time to buckle the fuck down 
 Side of the wobbly system back to original form, pumpkin 
 You can catch the memoir in several dimensions 
 The joy of life logic, don't employ the spite process 
 Hence, your plight botches 
 'I don't know what got into me 
 I didn't mean to cause all that destruction 
 I'm sorry... so sorry' 
 This be the big 
 F-L-A-S-H-F-L-O-O-D, Flashflood

 'Possible' 'Conceivable' 
 'Possible' 'Conceivable'
