(Limped up like a dog with three legs [shut up.] to the stage) 
 So many dark arts to choose 
 You can focus till the phobias evolve in forty hues 
 Whether you levitate or bend spoons 
 Tune into the prudence of the dark heart news 
 Breathing's a tug of war 
 Wet when I rushed aboard 
 Plus twenty nine bust gum stuck cluster door 
 Slumped in the back Burn bush by the son of George 
 Sweat, tear, and feed 'cause I don't bleed when I cut no more 
 A system of gods from each of the brawling tribes 
 So my bible is a pot of cons clipped and collaged 
 Pavlov's bad dogs parry mass bells 
 I don't speak the language but my last laugh's hell 
 Spiral, get vertigo 
 Signals that flash and beat 
 Postin my head from myself to get back to me 
 Pouch full of dynamite, blast cap anatomy 
 Bags full of smelling salts, mad as the magazine 
 Attack medic stretcher call cracked crazy header fall 
 A threat, a break, a mistake with the pulse 
 Picking every last fuckin' piece of paint off the walls 
 Ok the rotary phoner grow to be notably mobile 
 In social gopher tea formals or any scene where brie is normal 
 He will locate every exit in seconds to flee the wormhole 
 When emergency diversions ring the celly or the doorbell 
 Burnin it at both ends, friends let's commiserate 
 Turning into something, to the sound that the triggers make 
 Born at the badder side, half this time still await 
 Trainin' all my zeroes to perform like they're figure eights 
 Whether you levitate or bend spoons (x4) 
 Extra extra read all about it (x4) 
 Hey, four corners of the globe, all invent fire 
 On the very same day in the very same cold 
 Each sent a man with a torch to the borderline to boast 
 Watch them collide and explode 
 When I peal the blind back, up jumps the iron cough 
 Monky wrench in my hand, razor cut the eyelids off 
 Homemade 'tached memories 
 I ignore the private calls 
 And ever since the 80s I think something's in my Tylenol 
 What plague make an idling brigade 
 So eager to walk plans 
 They will climb a tree and wait 
 Irony is waiting over piety and faith 
 So when the ghostly ruminations that are kindly disobeyed 
 I'm gonna live to be a thousand with the patience of a saint 
 To see the hoi polloi becoming restless in their tanks 
 Can't hold howls and corrals with a key, 
 So will the worms please shriek on the count of three (three!) 
 If I had a dollar for every time I couldn't sleep, 
 I could buy a million locks and finally read a book in peace 
 No more would my president come off as a crooked thief 
 And turn my heart so dark that it would bark when he looked for me 
 Sideways eye on a sinister boundary 
 Peddlin' contemporaries killin' me loudly 
 99 models of fear on the wall timorous 
 Done run akin to the car on the lawn cinderblocks 
 Whether you levitate or bend spoons (x4) 
 Three legged dogs that chewin the wrong food 
 Riff raff [] 
 Land sharks stole the tape, money money booze
