Oh my God 
 They've got angels sweating like Helots 
 Working their little halos to the bones combing them deserts 
 My figure eight knotted lifeline defined traffic 
 The way my schooling innocently defined every day 
 One exquisite fit a crisis rivets an octagon of red 
 To the ceiling above my bed. It's not a conversation piece 
 Like public spectacles leash, more of a clue 
 So when I wake up to the rains, I'll be one step ahead of you 
 I slide like Kodachrome, wrote a poem for every planet 
 Typed their mileage from the sun in an envelope, licked it, stamped it 
 Got eight thank yous in the mail, but nine planets means there's one left 
 Only the earth would thank me later with a breath-taking sunset 
 (Man, I'm just a bum) 
 Zip that waterfall around your skeleton, tell it to boil 
 Loyalty's the shovel in the soil. Dig it, I split 
 My lip kissing the winter, nursed the blister in the sun 
 Strung a hammock between spring and where the willows turn to blood 
 Might a worm sip a little litter and love it 
 Without big beetles trying to sell him sunflower seeds by the bucket 
 Might a tugboat float a boxcut above these ashes 
 Without hot air balloons floating their four passenger baskets 
 And I'm asking you to let a captive lacerate a caption 
 Splash out massive upholster plastic glasses with famine patches 
 I-dentify for all saints linked around the fountain's warmth 
 And for a second taste of pain when removing that crown of thorns 
 (Anatropic?) motley click (macato?) born hostile 
 Pacifists huddled in subtle masochist stamp the blame on following an inkling 
 My fire escape overlooks ghost town market place 
 Martyrs bought out passes then fasten selves to the target face 
 You're killing me 
 If I had a hammer, I'd build a city on stilts 
 So my feet would stay dry when God's wine glass tilts 
 If I had a shovel, I'd dig a hole in the dirt 
 And I'll be hiding when his drunken stupor lands upon earth 
 And if your little wing is broken, I'll see the poacher in hell 
 I can't afford another anti-burden soldier to sell 
 My carousel mimics the interests of a thousand leaking spickets 
 And a colony of crazes raised to justify the grimace 
 (And yes I read the treaty) 
 And I prescribe brevity. Plus, the premise is 
 My pin cushion, my limbs pushing the knitting needles. Evils idle 
 Peddle past the greeting where the sleepers feed the cycles, stop 
 Watch the eagles board the little engine that could not 
 Ghost in a shell and it fell in my lap 
 Passion posted the bail but the guard had misplaced the key ring (That's 
 Wonderful) 
 I lead a fleet to blaze exact songs directly into the village power supply 
 Burning the bridge between the magnet and my eye 
 Now how many cadavers satisfy a mad man? 
 And how many crooked Samaritans turn Plesantville to bad land? 
 I can count my own dusty nickels with you laughing 
 About you'll turn my poor ass ebony and navy with cane lashings 
 (Well, you're right) 
 Grip your pointed stick, incite your riot 
 I'll sell your worth in a bottle at profit, explain my bias 
 Atomic box caught downward spiral rapidly, plaster hell with hate mail 
 Forged Christ's autograph laughed itself, crafted catastrophe 
 Biting my lip, skin, bones, stringent 
 Binging on rancid baits mummified well inside a muddy New York minute 
 Was it your remnants my smoke rings had cocooned prior to fading? 
 Well, it wasn't conscious spite, but it might have been that 
 I am not your friend anymore 
 My arrowhead dissertation when narrow bed sleepers occupy the basement 
 And I am not your friend anymore 
 Come the dawning of cerulean, your pity blend will be spit in the wind 
 Man, if it were only that simple, I'd add a gill-framed ichor 
 I'd board myself inside my room to trace the wilting contour 
 One petal falls to the rug: she loves me not. Town crier 
 Lugging a boom box with spirit plugs and a red radio flyer 
 Tied to irony like twenty burning igloos with a sailor's knot 
 Fiddler crabs build sandcastles while high tide off azalea crops 
 In the icicle field I portray, cats get antsy and ask 
 "Why if every light is dark do I continue dancing?" 
 Why if every light is dark do I continue dancing? 
 Why if every light is dark do I continue dancing? 
 Why if every light is dark do I continue dancing? 
 Well if it ain't finally a question that's worth answering 
 I boogie for the raindrops, for the purity, the anger (/anchor?), for my childhood recollections 
 For the comic book in my heart, the mocked intentions 
 The clarity, passion, seclusion, those cool summer nights 
 For the market merchant across the street selling me stogs at half price 
 For the mights, the maybes, the nauseating pitfall 
 My girl, my friends, for the fact my window opens towards a brick wall 
 For the three legged dog I saw dragged on a leash, for the homeless 
 Man who walks my block in rainstorms with plastic bags on his feet 
 See I've thrown away the tenders over one shoulder and walk across broken glass 
 Through every wicked world to kiss tomorrow's morning. Not for nothing 
 You'll drown in a pool of your crooked morals whispering 
 "Maybe Aesop Rock was on to something" 
 Maybe, no promises
