I don't shrug, I study the ramifications of my shovel 
 Lovin' the consequence of uprooting the jungle 
 I'm huggin' the cycle of Gemini stupid contenders for mutin' the puzzle 
 I don't budge the motives encased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas 
 My kitchen sink leaks like you're itching to speak a secret 
 'Bout the world spins yet nobody's pledged allegiance and why? 
 His beaming smile knew a private agony that burns 
 And when the children met divinity I sat to watch them merge 
 It goes pandemonium live 
 Y'all motherfuckers stand up volunteer tantrums while you're playin' somethin' vivid 
 Play your sympathy card turn the miseryclast 
 And a basket case is in a classless matrix with elastic stitches 
 (I zig in a zaggin'-only zone) 
 Raggin' a bag of lonely poem remnants 
 Short of breath like you're short of fresh 
 You're a portable mess 
 Carpetbagger spearheading tear peddling pretentious art critics, orphans 
 Trying to dismiss those pioneering their fortunes 
 You're a spectacle 
 Pushin' for pedagogue lacin' up paper weights walkin' on stilts talking' 
 You touched the hand of God and I'm like 
 What are these evils that plagued the hearts of men by sweet talking border patrol until they fold and let 'em in 
 You got your life in a basket before you could say instant classic 
 Like the king of the mountain requires a boost 
 I'll bury the hook in my belly just to volunteer at Live Aid clinics 
 For the thrill of nine great mimics with eighteen bloody lips, spittin' 
 Beanstalk, chalking outlines before the figures fly 
 Walkin' uphill trying to get down 
 Prominent ghost town litigant battle pitch darkness when the light switch hits the artistry circuit board breaker 
 Service in the greater half of nature 
 See money go wild shook when the exploitation incubated lovely 
 Warmingly piggy leader colony to comfort 
 Numb enough to deny the sin pins and evil needles even punctured 
 Till he won't define his turn and can still function 
 I don't shrug, I study the ramifications of my shovel 
 Lovin' the consequence of uprooting the jungle 
 I'm huggin' the cycle of Gemini stupid contenders for mutin' the puzzle 
 I don't budge the motives encased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas 
 Burn burn 'em mostly 
 Stuck unplucking plumage out the poultry 
 Soaking in bulk on a sofa with duct tape upholstery 
 Dirty doc stellar space medic 
 Stoned by the commoners for glowing 
 Pseudo-floaters bottom feed till bloated 
 Happy trail hitchhikers guide to spanning oblivion 
 Complete with a thankless 9-5 chapter 
 You can sign your life after the facts 
 Wicked soldiers pick it with buddy system logistic motors like Noah's ark ticket holders, pivot 
 All in a days breath 
 I guess 
 Sandman here to foreshadow a day when televisions run over baboon heart transplants 
 Sketching a glass partially empty till their hand cramps 
 With a iceman's dance if that ain't streamlined and stand with a fan's lamp 
 But maybe I do 
 Yeah yeah maybe it's all over, maybe I won the game before the machine ate my quarter 
 I mean absorbing attention's a must 
 You don't wanna be overlooked 
 Yeah but you don't wanna be looked over too much 
 One up for the dashed hopes of fifty fishermen who crashed boats 
 And the angels who never hit a bad note when harmonizing 
 I'm an armor plated farmer 
 I'm an archer rising with a drawn bow for the karma where the bulls eye clings and argues 
 Dense, spreads like new names at the writers bench 
 Either you drink it or sink it, cause ain't no sitting on the fence 
 You make me chuckle child, it's hells kitchen now, miss 
 Recognize your life is merely bait for bigger fish 
 I don't shrug, I study the ramifications of my shovel 
 Lovin' the consequence of uprooting the jungle 
 I'm huggin' the cycle of Gemini stupid contenders for mutin' the puzzle 
 I don't budge the motives encased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas 
 Encased inside the gauntlet's hunger quotas
