(Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop, keep on to the break of dawn 
 Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop, keep on to the break of dawn 
 Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop, keep on to the break of dawn 
 Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop, keep on to the break of dawn) 
 Put one up for shackle-me-not clean logic procreation 
 I did not invent the wheel, I was the crooked spoke adjacent 
 While the triple-sixer's lassos keep angels roped in the basement 
 I walk the block with a halo on a stick poking your patience 
 Y'all catch a thirty second flash visual 
 Dirty cooperative med platoon bloom head-trip split ridiculous 
 Fathom the splicing of first generation 
 Fuck-up with trickle-down anti-hero smack, Kraken 
 I pace my game to zero hour completion cretin, splash 
 Duke of early retirement picket dream 
 American nightmare hogging the screen 
 I'll hold the door open so you can stumble in 
 If you'd stop following me 'round the jungle gym 
 Now it's honor and I spell it with the 'H' I stole from heritage 
 Merit crutched on the wretched refuse of my teaming resonance 
 I promise, tempest tossed breed with a bleeding conscience 
 See, the creed accents responsive but my spores divorced the wattage 
 And I'm sleeping now (Wow!) yeah the settlers laugh 
 You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash 
 You won't be laughing when the buzzards drag your brother's flags to rags 
 You won't be laughing when your front lawn's spangled with epitaphs (You won't be laughing) 
 And I'll hang my boots to rest when I'm impressed 
 So I triple knot 'em and forgot 'em 
 This origami dream is beautiful 
 But man, those wings will never leave the ground 
 Without a feather and a lottery ticket, now settle down 
 All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day 
 Put the pieces back together my way 
 All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day 
 Put the pieces back together my way 
 All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day 
 Put the pieces back together my way 
 All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day 
 Put the pieces back together my way 
 (Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop, keep on to the break of dawn

 Slacker bound intimate tabloid headline with a pulse 
 Shimmy cross the centerfold, enter dead time engulfed 
 Divvy crumbs for the better souls 
 When seven deadly stains adhere to blame to crystal conscience 
 The result's a low life counting on one hand what he's accomplished, okay 
 Link me to activism chain, activate street sweep 
 Plug deteriorating Zen up in pen dragon 
 I hock spores coursed by the morbid spreading of mad men, alley gospel 
 Sinking your Lincoln-log cabin and Charlie Chaplin waddle 
 I could, zig, zag, and zig 'em again 
 Before the badge gleam sparkled in my brick wall windows 
 Another thick installment of one night in Gotham 
 Without the wretched 'Houston we have a problem' 
 Attached to the festive batch of city goblins 
 Who split holiday freak on a box cut cinema high road bellow? 
 Head gripped; watch red bricks turn yellow 
 Sorta similar to most backbones at camp Icarus 
 Where all fiddler crabs congregate and get pampered for bickering 
 Life's not a bitch, life is a beautiful woman 
 You only call her a bitch 'cause she won't let you get that pussy 
 Maybe she didn't feel y'all shared any similar interests (No) 
 Or maybe you're just an asshole who couldn't sweet talk the princess 
 Kiss the speaker wire, Peter Pacifism, pagan threshold 
 Stomach full of halo kibbles 
 Wingspan cast black upon vigils 
 Hear to duck hunt ticker tape vision and pick apart the pixels 
 I got a friend of polar nature and it's all peace 
 You and I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast 
 Metal Captain 
 This cat is asking if I seen his little lost passions 
 Told him "Yeah, but only when I peddled past 'em" 
 All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day 
 Put the pieces back together my way (My way) 
 All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day 
 Put the pieces back together my way (My way) 
 All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day 
 Put the pieces back together my way (My way) 
 All I ever wanted was to pick apart the day 
 Put the pieces back together my way
