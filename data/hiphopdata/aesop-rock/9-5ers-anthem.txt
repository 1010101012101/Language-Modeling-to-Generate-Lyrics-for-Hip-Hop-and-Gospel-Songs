Shit... Vanessa, what time is it? aw, fuck ... I late again, I gotta dip 
 Zoom in to the fuming of an aggravated breed 
 Via the study of post-adolescent agitated seeds 
 Half the patients waste themselves prior to Commencement 
 So I focus on the urban Oxygen samples, the half that made it breathe 
 This old Pompeii impression sways infection in twelve steps or less 
 And cretins swiftly tippy-toe on hard to swallow barter concepts 
 The give-it get-it, never let it slip past wrought iron stubbornness. 
 Martyrs talk funny causes into harvesting Spartacus and so on 
 I've thrown long Hail Mary bombs toward cookie-cutter Mother Nature's bedazzled synthetic fabrics 
 Life treats the peasants like they tried to fuck his woman while he slept inside, while they're merely chasing perfectionist emblems 
 When the clock strikes nine I'll be waking with the best of routine caffeine team players for the cycle of it 
 Under a dusted angel harp string Big Brother is watching my odometer like buzzard to fallen elk, hawkin' stealth 
 We got babies, rubber stamps, and briefcase parts 
 We on some door-to-door now, order ten dollars or more, we'll shove it down your throat for free 
 I'll sacrifice my inborn tendencies for copper pennies from one commander 'Gimme that' so he can retain baby fat 
 Mega biter snake bedlam, holocaust freak, heckle shiesty brain headroom shake planet 
 Make a move pause, make a move, break cannon 
 Bend barrel, one eight zero, u-turn, squeeze, end it 
 It's on like it's never been, It's bleeding well, 
 It's bigger than a breadbox, it corrodes my leaky finance 
 I'll take my seat top of the Brooklyn Bridge with a Coke and a bag of chips 
 To watch a thousand lemmings plummet just because the first one slipped 
 Sometimes I laugh at victory, kissing these little question marks 
 I tend to underestimate my average 
 Just another bastard savage 
 Someday you'll all eat out of my cold hand 'Cause every dog has its day at which point I'll pull it away 
 Now we the American working population 
 Hate the fact that eight hours a day 
 Is wasted on chasing the dream of someone that isn't us 
 And we may not hate our jobs 
 But we hate jobs in general 
 That don't have to do with fighting our own causes 
 We the American working population 
 Hate the nine-to-five day-in day-out 
 When we'd rather be supporting ourselves 
 By being paid to perfect the pastimes 
 That we have harbored based solely on the fact 
 That it makes us smile if it sounds dope 
 It's the year of the silkworm 
 Everything I built burned yesterday 
 Let's display the purpose that these stilts serve 
 Elevate the spreading of the silk germ 
 Trying to weave a web but all I in believe in is dead 
 It's the year of the jackal 
 Saddle up on high horse 
 My torch forced Polaris embarrassed 
 Shackle up the hassle by the doom and legend marriage 
 I bought some new sneakers I just hope my legacy matches 
 It's the year of the land shark 
 Dry as sand, parched, damn, get these men some water 
 They're out there being slaughtered in meaningless wars so you don't have to bother 
 And can sit and soak the idiot box trying to fuck their daughters 
 Man it's the year of the Orphan 
 Seated adjacent to the fireflies circling the torches on your porches 
 Trying to guard the fortress of a king they've never seen or met 
 But all are trained to murder at the first sign of a threat 
 Maybe it's the year of the water bug 
 Cockroach 
 Utter thug specimen 
 Fury spawned dreaming of your next of kin 
 I'm still dealing with this mess I'm in 
 I've been the object of your ridicule 
 You've been a bitch lieutenant 
 It's the year of the underpaid employee 
 Spitting forty plus a week 
 And trying to rape earth on my off time 
 You bored dizzy, I can't keep myself busy enough 
 So you can't run run run 
 And I'ma let you think you won 
 Everybody! 
 We the American working population

 Fumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen 
 Pour myself a cup of ambition and 
 Yawn and stretch and my life is a mess and 
 If I never make it home today, God bless 
 Fumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen 
 Pour myself a cup of ambition and 
 Yawn and stretch and my life is a mess and 
 If I never make it home today, God bless
