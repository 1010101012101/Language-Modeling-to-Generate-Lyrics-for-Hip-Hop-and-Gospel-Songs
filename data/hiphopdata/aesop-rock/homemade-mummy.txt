 How to make a homemade mummy: get a corpse, get gauze, get comfy, shampoo and disinfect dead fluffy for the hallowed excavation of his x-marked tummy, stem to stern, the butter cutter b-lines well, tongs butterfly the unzipped feline shell, we'll be escorting vital organs with exception of the precious kitten heart's into the privacy of separate pickle jars, or mayonnaise or jelly pick a card, shit, pick a part and scissor, stomach, lung, intestine or liver, in a world of sanitizers and preservatives forever, brain exterminated through the whiskers, *kiss*blow, ditched, I blank NY alone, we usher in the salts that call the husk home, might embalm and stiffen and rid the fawn of all his liquids, slather it in beeswax, wrap it up in ribbons, like limb by limb, by tail by ear by chin, within the hereafter I hereby win, I hope you vow to meow another day and never decompose, by the way before we seal these molds, the shorten version goes... 
 Gadzooks, punk's dead, last good gut wrenched, antennae sam cook, black book Pushead, cat skulls stacked to the black hole sunset, olive on a toothpick, Dagwood Bumsted, tagged-hoof hatchery, matter amass naturally, bad wolf, dash for the last rook castling, blue ox, red plaid bass pro flannel king, hasbro crown, sour apple Abba-Zabba teeth, in poorly taken pictures antiquating on his mantlepiece, before we only spoke in letters cut from magazines, folk broke bear claws over gross coffee, not as milquetoast men, as los muertos walking, ergo the scarecrow in rare barley, squared-off harpie to armchair: say a prayer for me, I feel that mystifying times have gotten ugly, I also feel that you could learn a lot from a mummy 
 Take the brain out, leave the heart in,
