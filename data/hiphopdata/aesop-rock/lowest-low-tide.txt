Built this city outta warm clay bricks, stood outside the walls with harps and sharp sticks, another stray kitten's elated to play chicken, 'cause everyday it rain the same array of clay pigeons, they were tired, the target's been over the same apartment, I mean you could pick 'em off by just recalling where your arms was, now they wanna pick and choose the armors, click and use the weapons till the city lose its marbles, it was fuses over charcoals in a barrel used for garbage, they would gather all the fighters up and barbecue the harvest, Satan's little starlets in the dark trying to pry you open, and shake a writer out his times new roman, I'm all... 
 Slow motion baby, I'm in a zone, so frozen, not a part of the phone home quotient 
 Instead I dance around fires, cutters in the sky singing "just how low is your lowest low tide?" 
 Low, low enough to gather up the halibut and scatter up the beach before the water's back to hassle us, meanwhile the mayor's on some art-crime camel clutch, and glamour submits to the lowest standards yet 
 Civil war if his vision isn't yours, if his definition differ send a pig to kick his door 
 'Oink oink' bellow from the bacon with the brawniest frame, that roll on your hood like tawny kitaen, and money nobody considers you a threat, more d-students dreaming of pea shooters, bet, you ain't project gunplay, you project runway, gentle and apprehensive 20 ways to Sunday, and I roam around the motor way with poker faces only seen on older apes who know how many soldiers made it home today 
 Damn that's freedom with a fee, I wash my face in the sea 
 See?
