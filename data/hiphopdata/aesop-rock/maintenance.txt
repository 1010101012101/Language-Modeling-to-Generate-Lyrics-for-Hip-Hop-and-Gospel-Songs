 Count that for me... thanks

 Well any asshole with a book of matches can light a fire fresh 
 Make that sucker burn for days, I'll be impressed 
 Surf 'n' abash the cultured bigot, procreation baked in fanciful 
 Then scurry up the grass to roll his marbles off the anthill 
 I know girth and good nature but recognize absentee ballots 
 And sappy ballads couldn't fill the void 
 It's James and the giant Tugboat Complex and HE'S ANNOYED! 
 (No one's asking you to build an Ark, brother!) 
 Hmm, it's fashion 
 I'll find my own bullies to shake a finger wrapped in 
 Realigned mine eyes in divine justice 
 Plus this uncontrollable laugh with those amber waves of brain finally crash 
 Brimstone clone with legs and dim poems 
 Ten little Zen crafts 
 Things cooperate like paper doll participant litigants 
 Picket well or ride a burner style clinic 
 Acid for the basics 
 P-H imbalance to burn the malice martyrs faceless 
 Then fabricate daytrips 
 I want to be the halo that jumps off the brain 
 Of the genius who decided some pictures deserved frames 
 (God and I are on a first name basis) 
 Yeah I call him God, he calls me Jesus 
 When I lost my religion, he fell to pieces 
 Blade, dragon, up hell's creek 
 Interrupting a devil pageant 
 Starfighter settling to madness 
 I keep my ghoul spirit concealed 
 Until the warriors return to the Coney Isle Wonder Wheel 
 My momma told me there'd be days like this 
 Days like this, days like this, days like this (yes she did)

 Okay, tell me who you chill with and I'll tell you who you are 
 I walk a mile with a leash attached to your freak seminar 
 It's a modern sensation on the boulevards of maintenance 
 To sweep your broken hopes under the rug then hug the playpen 
 This revolution pushing through the loose pins 
 And a strait-jacketed maverick classed in a bunk category 
 They had him parallel with a tattered glory division 
 (I could devil drink dreams out of thermos) 
 Yeah, with a whiskey afterburn 
 It's like, nine o'clock wake (I'm up) spit obscenities 
 My girl ties on my cape, smoke a bone then work my deviltry 
 The clear day's laced with a classic mother nature thunderchaser set 
 That got my paper crane's wings wet 
 Voyeurist amendments lacked expansive coverage in the syllabus 
 I dance with chuckles while you man the keyhole grilling post 
 I've done my chores according to God's schedule 
 With coffee holding the wheel and nicotine working the pedals 
 Metal edged canes that tends to repel the bevel 
 Kettle screeching out the operetta 
 I live to autograph the iron curtain with dove's back feather pens 
 Spurting magma, cursing television earns the burdens of my Cleopatra 
 Minor (Major) dispersed slap on the wrist 
 For the tenants lacking arms to harbor the rarity of thick friendship 
 Sunk with a "Yes sir" 
 Chained to fatigued ankle 
 Leagues beneath the angle 
 I'ma call home until the rock meets the angels
