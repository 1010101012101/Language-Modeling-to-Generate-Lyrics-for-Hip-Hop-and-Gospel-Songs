Got a buzz like I'm Georgia Tech 
 They're still cheering like I'm all that's left 
 The air is toxic when you draw your breath 
 Resurrect the music, I'm snatching it from claws of death 
 Vital signs are improving, I make 'em lay down 
 An idle mind is usually described as the devil's playground 
 My rep established I'm rapping just for the sport of it 
 Been nice for a career, you're just barely grasping the thought of it 
 Indebted to the hood like a RushCard 
 Supporter like push-up bras and lumbars 
 Except I'm never sitting, I'm ever-living like Mummm-Ra, I'm the sun god 
 Smart as a whip, but forever rippin it dumb-hard 
 I see you fronting with your dollar-store shades on 
 Faker than abs that's sprayed-on, artificial as Rayon 
 My rhyme is satisfying your Quest for Fire like Rae Dawn 
 Chung when I'm forming like Voltron I'm, yung Raekwon 
 Mix in a bit of KRS-One and Q-tip 
 Rakim, some of that Ice Cube. Now who's this? 
 No one as gifted as this, so magnificent 
 Classically consistent, I'm nasty as black licorice 
 Coldest, but I get the room hotter than bikram yoga 
 You seen the show, you know I make the people move like an eviction notice 
 I'm focused. I'm Moses when the mic is on 
 That's why these rappers scatter like roaches when the light is on 
 Hold it now, I hold it down 
 I'm staying where I'm at, you better go around 
 You know the voice and you know the sound 
 I rip the microphone and then I throw it down 
 Hold it now, I hold it down 
 I'm staying where I'm at, you better go around 
 You know the voice and you know the sound 
 I rip the microphone and then I throw it down
