Whoo, we on fire tonight 
 Whoo, yeah, we on fire tonight 
 Whoo, Black Star in the house fo' sho' 
 Yo, now everybody go 
 Ghet-to, P-pole it's time to ride 
 Supreme, supreme 
 Bay-b get involved go side to side 
 Supreme, supreme, yeah, yeah 
 Side to side 
 'Bout to slap box with the beat 
 The shit I spit is a snapshot of the street 
 You can see the crack spot in the backdrop 
 The heat in the stash box of the black drop 
 You wonder why there's more crime 
 Free food, or a check the only time niggaz on line 
 Getting information from the nigga-net 
 The trickle-down theory guess it ain't reached niggaz yet 
 I make a bigger bet, Kweli 'bout to be a bigger threat 
 'Cause there's hardly any real niggaz left 
 What the fuck these niggaz talking 'bout 
 Living a movie but the audience is walking out 
 I fight the temptation to rip the heart from your chest 
 Till there's only five hard beats left 
 It's like a dead man walking 
 I turn on the radio and I hear dead men talking 
 Ghet-to, p-pole it's time to ride 
 Supreme, supreme 
 Bay-b get involved go side to side 
 Supreme, supreme 
 Yo', I got my headphones up like I'm listening close 
 Face blank with expression it isn't a joke 
 Start fire, sit back and spit its smoke 
 To get it provoked, blow it back to get in your throat 
 Mad problems, take all the niggaz you know 
 Add that number up with every nigga you don't 
 Final number, some total of the niggaz that won't 
 Break me down, shake me of my fame, my style 
 What time it is? Crew you can hate me now 
 And ten minutes from then you gon' love me again 
 Buck town republic again 
 Writing on the wall trouble again 
 Intensify struggle and such killers, Sade lovers deluxe 
 Sound garnered, for the wild hearted, downtrodden, up-starters 
 Young violent, uprising, cocaine, and gunpowder 
 Up north, or bus crowded, daily vibes to thug mountain 
 Cold caves or peaks of high 
 Think you present but unclear, and know how to hide 
 If you wonder why you got so much on your mind 
 'Cause your living in a troubling time, this is a puzzling time 
 Fall back without recovering time, and time's up 
 Brooklyn, put your dimes up 
 Ghet-to, p-pole it's time to ride 
 Supreme, supreme 
 Bay-b get involved go side to side 
 Supreme, supreme 
 Ghet-to, p-pole it's time to ride 
 Supreme, supreme 
 Bay-b get involved go side to side 
 Supreme, supreme 
 I put feeling inside of my rap 
 Hold it down for my side of the map 
 No matter what north, south east or west side of the mat 
 Bend a needle on the mind and it's back 
 Got a problem with that? The holler back and the stars is black 
 We the New Era you just a Starter cap 
 Find out what happens when the artist in tact 
 Be sharp as a tack, fall back you smarter than that 
 Or perhaps you just ain't as smart as you think 
 Figure 8'n on the thin ice part of the rink 
 You a vessel that's promised to sink 
 Terra Firma ain't as hard as you think 
 Stare down, and you starting to blink 
 Like 182 this for fellas and the ladies who 
 Don't need to be spoon fed like baby food 
 I take a bite out the track like a sabretooth 
 And spit out the truth till the cops come and spray the booth 
 Ghet-to, p-pole it's time to ride 
 Supreme, supreme 
 Bay-b get involved go side to side 
 Supreme, supreme 
 Ghet-to, p-pole it's time to ride 
 Supreme, supreme 
 Bay-b get involved go side to side 
 Supreme, supreme 
 Ghet-to, p-pole it's time to ride 
 Supreme, supreme 
 Bay-b get involved go side to side 
 Supreme, supreme 
 It's all right with you it's all right with me 
 Do the damn thing what you wanna be 
 Supreme, supreme 
 That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right 
 That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right 
 Supreme, supreme 
 It's all right with you it's all right with me 
 Do the damn thing what you wanna be 
 Supreme, supreme 
 That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right 
 That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right 
 Supreme, supreme 
 It's all right with you it's all right with me 
 Do the damn thing what you wanna be 
 Supreme, supreme 
 That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right 
 That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right 
 Supreme, supreme
