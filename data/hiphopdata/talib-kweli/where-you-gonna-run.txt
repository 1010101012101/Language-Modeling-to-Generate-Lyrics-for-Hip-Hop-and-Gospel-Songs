Jean: 
 He's back again for the first day 
 We gonna do this one a little different. tryna test the waters 
 (Where you gonna run) 
 Jean: 
 Not far 
 (Where you gonna run) 
 Jean: 
 Wwhere you gonna go 
 (Jean Grae) 
 I write underground climb up, this a new line up 
 Niggaz fight your way through 
 If you're not ready to lose may I suggest that you let us the fuck through 
 Everybody clap your hands now, tear the walls down 
 Dance like Rudy Huxtable scoring a touchdown, you know 
 Hands in the air, knees in, knees out 
 Drop a little symbol on them this time, no doubt, let's go 
 I write ten years deep and tenure's still deep 
 My bad I'm sorry I don't like when phrases repeat 
 I meant for the decades almost passed and spaceball was the least 
 And I'm struggling still hustle to eat 
 I must be built with Adam and Eve skin 
 While y'all motherfuckers where you flushed in 
 With your heart poking through on your arm stupid 
 Drop more bombs than on Saddam's house unarmed 
 My mouth's a weapon I shout like Armguard steppin' 
 Didn't need to get loud, no disrepect 
 But you know the Jean is threat to your checks 
 Niggas heart burning no prowl though sec to stop the attack 
 Ya neck back's gettin' hot on every drop on the track 
 And now I finally got some heat is good, let it be known 
 I'll still be here after all this shit is done said and gone 
 Can't keep running the same formula, I'm imploring ya 
 To quit fucking the game up, before it fucks all of ya up 
 Where you gonna run 
 Where you gonna run 
 Where you gonna ruuuuuun 
 Where you gonna ruuuuuun 
 Where you gonna hide 
 Where you gonna ruuuuuun 
 Where you gonna ruuuuuun 
 (Kweli) 
 Yeah come on, yeah come on 
 (Talib Kweli) 
 Watch these niggas start to run soon as I hit the track 
 What get the sack, eyes low like Friskin' cat 
 My flow get cap throw they gun like official Nas 
 I'm draftin you niggas hard quick fast like tiptonat 
 Diamond cut lyrics so sharp the spit split the glass 
 Your mouth writing a check that you ask and quick to cash 
 Screaming how you quick to shoot don't even know the screenplay 
 Niggas rappin' black and white and rappers shakin' Jean Grae 
 Sick of niggas licking boots I pick and choose my battles when I spit the truth it's hot 
 Let the pride and move the cattle 
 Y'all don't really want no beef, that's too real you want veal 
 You baby sheep hanging in the air and tend to raffle me 
 Me? I don't like the taste this shit's gamey 
 Like magazines telling lies and Star Wars like Dick Chaney 
 It sucks though they losing they flavor like Now and Laters 
 When I bust them niggas run for the hills like Al Queda 
 Where you gonna run 
 Where you gonna run 
 Where you gonna ruuuuuun 
 Where you gonna ruuuuuun 
 Where you gonna hide 
 Where you gonna ruuuuuun 
 Where you gonna ruuuuuun 
 (Jean Grae) 
 She lacks delivery, really, nigga I pack rap symmetry and send it to ya dorm 
 Why y'all iggin' me for sure 
 Jean is synonymous to chivalry 
 Open doors but I step through first 
 Test the waters and I pee in them got no network 
 But now everyone's a rapper and everyone'll shoot you dead 
 Only led I strapped with a razor sharp pencil that could write but it could stab you rapid 
 It's all ass backwards, you're all mall performers, actors 
 What tho?, come on let's race to where the cash is 
 Get mauled like Roy the alter boy 
 I'll jet through you like a Jet through flight, I'm unemployed 
 You still cared to touch me, I gotta keeps the rap level 
 You face screwed ugly 
 I'm chasing all you club bunnies 
 And racing you tackle you down 
 Take your money with your chest on the ground 
 I know it's foul, what you gonna do now 
 Where you gonna run 
 Where you gonna run 
 Where you gonna ruuuuuun 
 Where you gonna ruuuuuun 
 Where you gonna hide 
 Where you gonna ruuuuuun 
 Where you gonna ruuuuuun 
 (I think it's time you gave it up!)
