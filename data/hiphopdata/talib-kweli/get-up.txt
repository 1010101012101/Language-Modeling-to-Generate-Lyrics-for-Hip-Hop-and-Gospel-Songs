We be blazin', so amazin 
 Everybody get up everybody get up 
 We be blazin', so amazin 
 Everybody get up everybody get up 
 Talib Kweli: 
 New year new record time to do bigger shit 
 Caught a plane to Cali link with my nigga Quick 
 I fickled with the combination, we bomb the nation but stay calm and patient 
 At the world got hyper hearing I'm musical conversation 
 It's a beautiful situation right here 
 Givin' birth on the track 'cause the cipher stay pregnant with ideas 
 And we rockin' it, rock rock rockin' it 
 Till the hater players put a sock in it 
 Poppin' shit that you got to get 'cause we properly document 
 How cats look more like dicks than the Washington monument 
 Phallicly tryin' to challenge me but who you racin with 
 Is amazin with lyrical lingerie, I be lacin shit 
 We be blazin' it so put it in the air with the chronic 
 My lyrics like drugs got you hooked on my phonics 
 From Brooklyn to Compton to Lounge to Soundbombing 
 Still Rockin' off the balance of options 
 Now if you got a spliff then (Put it in the air) 
 If you wanna riff then (Put it in the air) 
 If you shakin your act (Put it in the air) 
 If you makin' it loud (Put it in the air) 
 If you need a crib strapped then (Put it in the air) 
 Take your hand off the gat and (Put it in the air) 
 It's not your bud in the club (Put it in the air) 
 Got nothin' but love (Put it in the air) 
 They say my rhymes is too heavy I come thicker than the fog 
 You get it when I retire and battle my catalogue 
 Writin rhymes in my captain's log, black stardate emcees 
 Fake like Egyptian gods in Stargate, lovin' to hate 
 But with all types of weight in they raps 
 I draw blood like mosquitos, y'all annoy like gnats 
 Pop that around a brown cat get laid flat 
 Concrete adjust to the contours of your back 
 Quick where you at? 
 (Quick) 
 Yo I'm in the back room makin' a run 
 Ain't even touched her and makin' her cum 
 And you can catch me out in Portland with Stoudamire 
 Everybody doin' shows but I'm the hottest flier 
 Bitches sayin' "honest, I swear to God" 
 Talkin' like them believin her is so damn hard 
 Could you really blame a nigga if I fuck then skate? 
 You didn't even pay that's why you flaunt the date 
 All you did was eat salad, talk shit about niggas and drink wine 
 And your answer kept changin 'cause bitch you keep lyin' 
 Talkin' bout "he make me sick" 
 "All he do is disrespect me keep callin me bitch 
 And he only wanna fuck me when he off of that dope" 
 What the fuck you think I'm here for, not to love you I hope 
 All I'm bout to do is listen for a minute while I get my drink bended 
 Introduce you to my dog Kweli and go up in it 
 Talib Kweli: 
 Now if you got a spliff then (Put it in the air) 
 If you wanna riff then (Put it in the air) 
 If you shakin your act (Put it in the air) 
 If you makin' it loud (Put it in the air) 
 If you need a crib strapped then (Put it in the air) 
 Take your hand off the gat and (Put it in the air) 
 It's not your bud in the club (Put it in the air) 
 Got nothin' but love (Put it in the air) 
 Now let me tell you how I am... 
 I'm mild mannered in the day, a superhero at night 
 I got the special invite, I make your spot look right 
 No ice, no Range, no bottle of champagne 
 And Half these motherfuckas can't pronounce the name 
 I so cool why you hypin at the coffee shop 
 Hype niggas make girls be like "Get off me, stop" 
 Real niggas like us, yo of course we rock 
 'Cause the game un-orthodox/ off top 
 You got cold feet, like a pro off ya socks 
 Always goin' downtown pullin all the stops 
 Your breath smellin like fish from right off the docks 
 That's How you lost your spot you're too hype 
 Light a spliff and (Put it in the air) 
 If you wanna riff then (Put it in the air) 
 If you shakin your act (Put it in the air) 
 If you makin' it loud (Put it in the air) 
 If you need a crib strapped then (Put it in the air) 
 Take your hand off the gat and (Put it in the air) 
 It's not your bud in the club (Put it in the air) 
 Got nothin' but love (Put it in the air)
