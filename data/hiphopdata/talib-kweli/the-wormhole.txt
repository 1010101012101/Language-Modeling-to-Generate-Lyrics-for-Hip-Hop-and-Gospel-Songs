Oh you niggas wanna get deep? 
 Niggas wanna kick knowledge? 
 Y'all niggas ain't deep man, y'all niggas lost me 
 Soon as you steady tryna tell me which rappers in the fuckin' Illuminati 
 Then I'm like, show me the proof right? 
 Niggas start talking about the anti-Christ and aliens and shit 
 Save the ghost stories for the kids nigga, I'm a grown ass man 
 Let's go, let's go 
 You can lead a man to a drink 
 But you can't make him take a sip 
 You can lead a man to a link 
 But that don't mean he gonn' click 
 What's this? Y'all ain't really on no deep shit 
 I peeped it, scared of a motherfuckin' secret 
 Society and only bein' with people you agree with 
 You scared of a chalice scared of death 
 Only thing worse is your silence 
 Illuminatis enlightened, the OWL see in the darkness 
 Masonic roots still survive from the book of dearly departed 
 Egyptologist and scholars 
 Symbologists at the college 
 Will all acknowledge that ancient Kemet is where it started 
 Way farther back than the knights 
 Or the Rite of the Scottish 
 You need to wake up, no new Bugatti 
 My enemy tryna stop me but I don't stand a chance 
 If I can't identify 'em properly 
 Illuminati as we know it started in Bavaria 
 Years before it landed on the shores of America 
 The mission: abolishment of government and religion 
 They were enemys of the state 
 And they was hated by the Christians 
 They was Poets, they was Scholars 
 Early Illuminati was sorta like the students 
 In Victor Hugo's Les Miserables 
 The modern day politicians would diss 'em 
 Turning them into martyrs 
 This in turn inspired the founding fathers 
 The vast majority Masons who were the subject of the Illuminati 
 Found this fascination the order was insipiration 
 And ain't no disrespect to the masons 
 But you try to keep secrets then it leads to speculation 
 Only those in league with Satan need to hide information 
 That's how you catch a ride to your final destination 
 Where the proof, show 'em proof put it all on the table 
 When the facts are intact ain't no need for a fable 
 Good versus evil is primitive 
 Real life's more complex, what's your context? 
 They put the symbols on the dollar bill, the monument, the obelisk 
 They honouring Columbia the children of the colonists 
 You can trace it back to the root trace it back again 
 It's really just another case of stealin' from the African 
 Racism and vanity justify the sale of flesh 
 You property like cattle or produce but are you still as fresh? 
 Population control is real, you know the deal 
 But still perpetuate the cycle of violence 
 We known to hold the steel 
 No, I don't need no fuckin' chorus 
 Used to read so many books 
 Thought I was a hoarder down at Borders 
 Like Behold the Pale Horse or The New World Order 
 But you really don't know what you reading 
 If you really don't know the author 
 A lot of Satan worship is just government propaganda 
 Unsubstantiated lies with no proof a bunch of slander 
 Of course there are forces against you and that's a fact 
 Don't get caught in the distraction, it's bigger than any rapper 
 The truly oppressed ain't got the luxury of inventing a monster 
 The devil incarnate is much realer than the devil in concert 
 What they doing so sinister 
 Worse than any blood sacrifice you can imagine 
 Iller than any cinema 
 The Federal Reserve, the World Bank and the IMF 
 Helping the poor get poorer you in debt until your dying breath 
 Food, vaccines, humanitarian aid 
 They want control of the region, they really tryna get paid 
 Obey thy consumer make a product out of man 
 Where's the conspiracy? It's always been the plan 
 Y'all niggas scared of one world currency 
 But still paying your taxes 
 It ain't the Illuminati that worry me 
 Lack of spiritual energy, suicidal tendencies 
 Unwitting soldiers in the armies of the enemy 
 I'm leaking information so follow me down the wormhole 
 Same reason that they called Bradley Manning a turncoat 
 (Man, we supposed to be brothas!) 
 Oh what you tryna get smart? 
 Nigga you tryna kick some knowledge? 
 Nigga fuck that give me your muthafuckin jewelry nigga 
 Take that shit off 
 Oh you got a pager too huh? 
 You a balla huh? You a balla huh? 
 Gimme that muthafuckin' shit 
 Better me than the muthafuckin cops nigga
