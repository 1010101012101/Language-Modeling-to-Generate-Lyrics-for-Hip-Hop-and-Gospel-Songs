(Y'all don't know right here this is the next single featuring 
 My man Talib Kweli, called Mood Swing, we gonna do it like this why'all) 
 You can run to every new thing under the sun 
 You be a jack of all trades and a master of none 
 Mood Swinging 
 La la la la la... eh ooh ooh X4 
 Soon come you will understand 
 The motivation of a man getting the under hand 
 A local yokel on a mission to get global 
 Lettin' my vocals amass to some total 
 And keep the point focal, you hear me but you don't listen 
 You think its easy being put in this position 
 I freak speech, but still don't want to preach 
 This peak thought in stimulate movement at at Emcees 
 Grab your gat hit the streets, that the rally cry the war horn 
 The activist, those cats is spiritually war torn environment 
 So I leading a community movement 
 And I don't need money for me to make a community improvement 
 Tell me what you stand for 
 Would you settle for less or do you have the strength to demand more 
 Only time will tell, what this new world brings 
 Revolutions at order, check the mood swing, swing 
 Swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing, swing 
 Low like sweet chariot 
 What I say make my voice deep as berries get 
 Carry it like a torch 
 Give birth to rhymes to meet beats and then I'll marry 'em off 
 Have a divorce if the track is whack 
 (Please) My rhymes a rolling stone 
 Home is where the high hatters at, its on this song 
 (It on this song) Maybe one day it'll settle down 
 It ain't no good it all better now, come on let it now 
 Mood swing, changing the way we do things 
 It's a good thing, listen to the whole hood sing 
 As they go la, la, la, la, la... 
 Yeah as they go la, la, la, la, la... 
 No fear no doubt and no worry everything is on time there's no hurry 
 Mood swinging, swinging, mood swing, swinging 
 Mood swinging, swinging, mood swing, swinging, ooh ooh 
 Me and baby in the rental 
 She talkin' gentle hit the hotel to presidential 
 Sweet... kisses on the temple make her feel special 
 Light a candle scent got us in this sentimental 
 Move it's right wit the light just so I could see 
 Begin to set the pace for what we gon' get into 
 My fingers is lyrics its back is the instrumental... 
 Ancient secrets, Indian, and Oriental 
 Blackin' out doin' shit that I can't rap about 
 Passin' out, wakin' up, not awake awake enough to take it up and not stop 
 Love is a friends never know if we can love again 
 I said we gotta leave, she asked if she can come again (come again) 
 I had to meet Asheru at the studio 
 I'm runnin' late, you know I hate to make a nigga wait 
 But damn baby "You look good in the summer time 
 Gimme some of yours, I'm a give you some of mine" 
 Yo Kweli I remember being in the same dilemma 
 Hip-hop was number one my girl was number one contender 
 The great pretender wit a whole different agenda 
 Until I make it big "Life is one long gig" 
 Mood swing like Ella of cold train its classic 
 Like Soul Train its timeless just like this rhyme is 
 So all of why'all that wagging they campaign 
 Grab a hold of that mood swing and do the damn thing 
 Mood swing, changing the way we do things 
 It's a good thing, listen to the whole hood sing 
 As they go la, la, la, la, la... 
 Yeah as they go la, la, la, la, la... 
 Uh you can run to every new thing under the sun 
 You be a jack of all trades and a master of none 
 Mood swinging, swinging, mood swing, swinging 
 Mood swinging, swinging, mood swing, swinging 
 I'm an outlet 
 A front of which which you ain't figured out yet 
 A resource, I pivot your efforts on the right course 
 It seats ya, doin' whatever it takes ta reach ya 
 All of its in me, no really its in me 
 A good brother, lovin' son, a great lover 
 I'm a truth seeker, on a quest not a believer 
 I'm an emcee for all of the world to see 
 Yeah ya got my word on it, I'll put the Herd on it 
 That we rep shit, it's the least to be expected 
 Fuck that prep shit, jump on stage like we connected 
 From the same minds saying the same things at the same time 
 Back stage rappin' like gettin' ready for game time 
 We a family, and ain't nothing goin' to change that 
 For better or worse like somebody prearrange that 
 The way it is the way it always will be so I can still and still be 
 Soon come we will witness a shift in consciousness 
 And black music is one of our greatest accomplishments 
 (One now) our names will live on this monument 
 So that our kids can hold up they heads with confidence 
 That's when our nation will rise and realize that 
 Life without knowledge is death in disguise 
 The answer to my comprehension is just too complex 
 One minute from the next, go from happy ta vexed 
 Mood swing, yeah 
 See change is good sometimes 
 Mood swing, yeah 
 It's time for the essence to rhyme 
 It's time to mood swing 
 Take it on back 
 Mood swing (repeat) 
 La, la, la, la (repeat)
