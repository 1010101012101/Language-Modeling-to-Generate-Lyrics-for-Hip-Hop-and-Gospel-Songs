A keynote speaker's about to come on now 
 I just wanted to say a few words about him, and you all know who he is 
 Talib Kweli 
 Please, hold your applause till the end 
 We are glad to come and hear you speak 
 We love it! 
 Kweli doesn't like me to talk about this but one time we were drivin' through the Mississippi Delta 
 And there was a brotha runnin' up the side of the road 
 And he didn't have any, shoes on 
 He didn't have a, shirt on 
 And I started to drive right by this man but Kweli said, "Stop the car, beause that brotha, might be in trouble" 
 And I stopped the car 
 Kweli said to the man, he said, 
 "Brotha, are you OK? Do you need a ride somewhere?" 
 And the man looked at Kweli and said, 
 "Shhhh ... I'm escapin'" 
 And Kweli took him by the hand and said, 
 "My brotha, you didn't get the memo. We have been FREE, for some time now" 
 Well, I'm windin' it up 
 Please welcome, a good friend, scholar, ghetto philosopher, three time Nobel Peace Prize winner, first black man to pilot an air craft, the nigga that made up the Nike Swoosh, the man that made Kool Aid say, "Oh Yeah" Brooklyn's own, Talib Kweli
