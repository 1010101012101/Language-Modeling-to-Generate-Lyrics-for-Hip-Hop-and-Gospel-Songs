Lets try something new 
 It's been a long time coming! 
 Let me try something brand new 
 Hey yo Ski! 
 What you ever do, man? 
 Come on! 
 Yo, what we doing it for? 
 This is for all the day-trippers and the hipsters 
 Whores and the fashionistas 
 Spiritual leaders practicing all the laws of attraction 
 The teachers who read the passages from the Bhagavad Gita 
 That be bustin' off Dalai Lama's or flashing heaters 
 The last of the boosters 
 With the shooting, the thugging and all the booning and spooning 
 And all the crooning, and cooning and auto-tuning, alive 
 You be tellin', peddlin' to consumers I'm helping them to see through it 
 Get with this new movement, let's move it 
 Feel the cold rain 
 Still I'm standing right here 
 Even the winter summer days 
 Yeah I'm a product of Reaganomics 
 From the blocks where he rocking the feds like J Electronica 
 Drop and make this a lock 
 If he promises where the heart is 
 Whether Jesus or Mohammed, regardless of where the mosque is 
 They hope for the Apocalypse like a self-fulfilling prophecy 
 Tell me when do we stop it? 
 Do they ask you your religion before you rent an apartment? 
 Is the answer burning Korans 
 So that we can defend Islamics? 
 The end is upon us with a hashtag - a trending topic 
 You take away the freedoms that we invite in the game 
 Then you disrespect the soldiers, you ask them to die in vain 
 In a desert praying for rain 
 The music's like a drug, and they tend to take it to vein 
 It ain't for the well-behaved 
 The soundtrack for when you're great but its more for when you've felt afraid 
 More than your average rapper 
 So you sort of felt the way 
 The brain is like a cage, you a slave, that is why they lovin' you 
 This is the book that Eli that start with a KW 
 Feel the cold rain 
 Still I'm standing right here 
 Even the winter summer days 
 I do it for the trappers, other rappers 
 The Backpackers, the crackers 
 The niggas, the metal-packers 
 The victims of ghetto factories 
 I do it for the families, citizens of humanity 
 MC's, endangered species like manatees 
 I do it for the future of my children 
 They the hope for the hopeless 
 Karma approaches, we're gon' be food for a flock of vultures 
 The end of the world, ain't nothing left but the cockroaches and the freedom fighters 
 We're freedom writers like Bob Moses, the chosen freedom writers like Voltaire 
 For my block, my borough, my hood, my city, my state, yeah 
 My obligation to my community is so clear 
 We gotta save them, this opportunity so rare 
 We do it so big over here that it's no fair 
 To the punks, the bitches, the chumps, the snitches, the sneak in the game 
 We let them live with although they're weak and they're lame 
 The bozo's and joker's, promotin' when they're speaking my name 
 Feel the cold rain 
 Still I'm standing right here 
 Even the winter summer days
