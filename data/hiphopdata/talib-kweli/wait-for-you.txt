Better get it while the getting is good, you do what you do 
 No hesitation ain't no time for playing games 
 Go head and take all you can, and grab with both hands 
 Do it big or they won't even know your name 
 While the getting is good, you do what you do 
 No hesitation ain't no time for playing games 
 Go head and take all you can, and grab with both hands 
 Do it big or they won't even know your name 
 What are you doing with your life your time on earth is sacred 
 The time you spend at your plantation is it worth the paper 
 It's like you working for nathan the money's circulating 
 Can't pay your mortgage but you buying bottles perpetrating 
 Chill with them threatening raps 
 You sound lame you a snake you made the plane with your venomous acts 
 They call me Gentleman Sav because I back Miss Congeniality like Benjamin Bratt 
 Attracting chicks like femine- 
 While you only deal with the bitches I deal with the realest women 
 And still how they feel the rhythm in they mid section 
 When they blessed with the child bearing hips 
 Softest pair of lips is when they hair get flipped 
 I love my culture and heritage, keep me from being derelict 
 Invested in myself like this was Merrill Lynch 
 Been waiting for my second coming like I'm heaven sent 
 Even though I'm not your savior, I grace you with my benevolence 
 Better get it while the getting is good, you do what you do 
 No hesitation ain't no time for playing games 
 Go head and take all you can, and grab with both hands 
 Do it big or they won't even know your name 
 While the getting is good, you do what you do 
 No hesitation ain't no time for playing games 
 Go head and take all you can, and grab with both hands 
 Do it big or they won't even know your name 
 My style is unfadeable and hater proof I'll slay the proof 
 I'm known to interrupt the program, like late breaking news 
 Some say its only egg heads that I cater to 
 Then wait a few in order to make an omelet I gotta break a few 
 My plate is full I wasn't suppose to be here but I made it through 
 My reputation grew I left blood on the stage for you 
 How dare you say that my commitment is debatable 
 I'm married to the music you rhythm then I'm a slave to you 
 Commercial artist so relatable, consumer appetite is insatiable 
 I could do what they could do easily 
 But then they say Kweli be seeming fake to you 
 Record sales ain't making you, money is motivating you 
 The artist gotta lead I hope the fan base stay with you 
 The products shoddy if you rush it for the paper true 
 D'Angelo and Sade they take a decade or two 
 Keep that good music coming and they'll wait for you 
 Better get it while the getting is good, you do what you do 
 No hesitation ain't no time for playing games 
 Go head and take all you can, and grab with both hands 
 Do it big or they won't even know your name 
 While the getting is good you, do what you do 
 No hesitation ain't no time for playing games 
 Go head and take all you can, and grab with both hands 
 Do it big or they won't even know your name
