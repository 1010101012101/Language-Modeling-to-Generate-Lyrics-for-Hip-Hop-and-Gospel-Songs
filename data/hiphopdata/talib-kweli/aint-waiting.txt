Once upon a time in a land far far away 
 I tried to play but my heart in the way 
 This part a little harder to say 
 It's like a white girl trapped in a well 
 Help is coming but its scary as hell 
 But very well here go the fairy tale 
 Now Cinderella want a fella who is not so ghetto 
 So she follow bread crumbs like Hansel and Gretel 
 Hello that'll make her drop her underwear 
 Dough longer than Rapunzel hair 
 Everyone stare when she walk in she like 
 What you want 
 Yo I'm not in the front I be blunt my make that ass bump 
 I know that's what they want 
 Me too with my hands up she turn around like man 
 Here I am 
 But I know her from work she pass by like he ain't that fly you got 
 One more chance 
 To fall down the rabbit hole 
 Let me take you to Wonderland or I'm making some other plans 
 I don't wanna spend the night 
 Trying to figure out how to spend my life 
 I don't wanna spend my time 
 Waiting for you waiting for you 
 I don't wanna spend the night 
 Trying to figure out how to spend my life 
 I don't wanna spend my time 
 Waiting for you waiting for you 
 Everybody say oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Waiting for you waiting for you 
 Say oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Waiting for you waiting for you 
 I made you a star your light was shining it's so right 
 So right that it dwarfed the chicks like Snow White 
 So nice got down with the team and now you one of us 
 Got me singing like prince you sexy motherfuh 
 You could be my princess bride call you my buttercup 
 I love when you letting me be the man 
 Let me take you by the hand like Wendy in Petter Pan 
 If you fly by night that's right I'll let you make a wish 
 That's right eat you up like a favorite dish 
 Man I pray you not the wicked witch 
 Made it through 
 A situation where I broke my promise now I'm tryna be honest love 
 So can you 
 Sometimes people evolve but that involves knowing exactly 
 What you want 
 And right now I wanna [?] 
 What they want 
 My life is an open book you had a chapter but will it end happily ever after 
 I don't wanna spend the night 
 Trying to figure out how to spend my life 
 I don't wanna spend my time 
 Waiting for you waiting for you 
 I don't wanna spend the night 
 Trying to figure out how to spend my life 
 I don't wanna spend my time 
 Waiting for you waiting for you 
 Everybody in the house say oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Oh oh oh oh 
 Waiting for you waiting for you 
 Oh oh oh oh oh 
 Say it with me oh oh oh oh oh 
 Say it with me oh oh oh oh 
 Waiting for you waiting for you 
 Life ain't a fairy tale 
 Now they say sister's bitter and the brothers is grim 
 Time to let the story end and let another begin 
 I spun straw into gold like Rumpelstiltskin 
 Still a hole in my soul that love won't fill in 
 She Sleeping Beauty cause her eyes are closed 
 Tried to sleep on your boy like Brian Rose 
 Get you wide like the coke in your nose 
 And I'm lying like Pinocchio 
 Gotta know when its time to go gotta know when 
 Here we are 
 We had some good times had some Little Red Riding Hood times but 
 Once again 
 I'm the big bad wolf don't hit me with the sad look love 
 Here I am 
 I'm still the same old me but I don't know if we should give it 
 One more chance 
 To add another chapter life ain't always happily ever after 
 I don't wanna spend the night 
 Trying to figure out how to spend my life 
 I don't wanna spend my time 
 Waiting for you waiting for you 
 I don't wanna spend the night 
 Trying to figure out how to spend my life 
 I don't wanna spend my time 
 Waiting for you waiting for you
