Talib speaking: 
 I ain't out 2 diss nobody 
 But we gon keep it real 4 a second 
 Can we keep it real 4 a second 
 Brooklyn stand up 
 If you doing ya grizzly I respect that 
 But a lot of rappers is saying things they don't mean 
 People see through dat 
 Talib Kweli 
 Niggas lie a lot, niggas lie a lot 
 Niggas lie, niggas lie, niggas lie a lot 
 I know you think you nice, 
 U just nice on ya block 
 Wit these crabs in da bow 
 Tryin' 2 rise 2 the top 
 This is why I'm hot 
 This is why I'm hot 
 I ain't scared 2 die 
 I ain't scared of gettin' shot 
 I got the fear of god 
 And from all that I been through 
 If you fuck with the family 
 Then I gotta put it in u 
 Pause, now continue 
 I love the competition 
 I ain't got no issue with the battles or dissin 
 But I keep it straight wit u 
 We shootin from the hip 
 I can't stand these rappers dat just shootin off they lip 
 Every rapper is a clapper 
 Your producer is a shooter 
 Engineer gotta nine 
 Label boss gotta ruger 
 Yeah right we ain't stupid 
 We don't believe these losers 
 Gotta mac in da booth 
 Tell the truth, it's a computer 
 So let me guess you make it that impressin 
 I seen you on myspace, u just wanna be friends 
 So let's not pretend, I respected ya block 
 Until I put it all together, now let's connect da dots 
 Niggas lie a lot, niggas lie a lot 
 Niggas lie, niggas lie, niggas lie a lot 
 I know you think you nice, 
 U just nice on ya block 
 Wit these crabs in da bow 
 Tryin' 2 rise 2 the top 
 Ok, u say you rap 
 U know how I can tell you whack 
 It's 2007 n u still sellin crack 
 Back 'n' 1986 when we was shootin over sneakers 
 Crack was king but now they slangin 'n' it's drastically cheaper 
 It ain't a real demand there ain't no short supply 
 Just the same old crackheads getting twice as high 
 These niggas like 2 lie on how they kill on corners 
 They still corny, they don't know what the real new york is 
 Faster than a rose 'n' crime inner city drop 
 It wasn't 'cause the mayor added 40,000 cops 
 U on the corner like "wow, my style is pretty hot" 
 But my style mile is equal 2 20 city blocks 
 Most say new york is soft 
 It's softer with the beef shit 
 Niggas can't separate the music from the street shit 
 Man that's some weak shit 
 Them niggas never classic 
 Remember bastards 
 Talib Kweli forever Blacksmithin
