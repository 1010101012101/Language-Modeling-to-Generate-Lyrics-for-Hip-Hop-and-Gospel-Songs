I'm from a place 
 Where you gotta let yo' nutz hang 
 Where them crakas used to cut your stomach open 
 Just to let your fuckin' guts hang 
 Right there in front of the kids 
 I might as well split your wig 
 'Cause that's just what the master did 
 But now I'm the new Nat Turner 
 Spreadin' something to the kids 
 Like Sojourner, man, the truth 
 Fuck a 'Creek, I care 
 But you in doubts and go "Woof" 
 He ain't dead, what pledge 
 There's a stank up in the Bush 
 Or a stank up in the White House 
 Shootin' board bullshit, man, it's dead props 
 Here in Chicago but hit this hi-lo 
 Warriors come play, click the bottles 
 Cock them AK's, bust on KK's 
 With the knuckle boy or the other two and the Stic-Man 
 Given dead on your shirt like a wristband 
 You a grown man, nigga, stand tall 
 Don't it hurt, 'cause you really ain't a nigga, dog? 
 Don't it hurt, 'cause you really ain't a nigga, dog? 
 Don't it hurt, 'cause you really ain't a nigga, dog? 
 Country boys, city boys 
 Cadillacs, Rolly Royce 
 Whatever, long as we ridin' 
 Pretty girls, ghetto boos 
 On the boulevard, in the avenue 
 It's a long walk, now that we ridin' 
 Yo, niggas is not original 
 Niggas follow the radio 
 Niggas think if you blow 
 Then you gotta be on the TV show 
 Crackas is hypocritical 
 Crackas will rob and shit on you 
 'Cause see you do what they do 
 They know freedom is powerful 
 Niggas is very visual 
 If we see it, we think it's true 
 Very few niggas make a move 
 And even less'll see it through 
 Crackas make up the chemicals 
 Then they call us the criminals 
 Crackas make all the loot 
 And we just get the residuals 
 Niggas will rob and shoot on you 
 Crackas will drop a bomb on you 
 Niggas is having funerals 
 Crackas is having barbecues 
 Niggas sing the blues 
 That's reminicin' the spiritual 
 But when you say gawd is you 
 Niggas ain't really hearing you 
 Crackas like to capitalize 
 Them crackas a lie 
 They say if you don't unionize 
 Then you'll probably die 
 I hate callin' niggas, niggas 
 So I'ma take it backwards 
 But I got now love for Whithey 
 I love callin 'em crackas 
 Country boys, city boys 
 Cadillacs, Rolly Royce 
 Whatever, long as we ridin' 
 Pretty girls, ghetto boos 
 On the boulevard, in the avenue 
 It's a long a walk, now that we ridin' 
 Yeah, I call myself real N I G G A 
 'Cause Kweli be showin' on the floor 
 And they policies, my philosophies 
 Show you that the block is a part of me 
 Freedom fighter like Richard Carter be 
 It's deep how the street knowledge beef 
 'Cause it ran like a code inside of me 
 It's practical, not scholarly 
 Now why do I call myself a nigga, you ask me 
 Who's got my back when the cops harass me 
 New York, L.A or Cincinnati 
 Can ride the train or with the Caddie 
 When they call you, nigga they scared of you 
 They fearin' you so actually 
 If crack is gone, be fearing niggas 
 Then that's what the fuck I have to be now 
 It's a badge of honor 
 And some say that shit's absurd 
 It's more than just a word 
 We flip the shit like it's a bird 
 Pass it down through generations 
 Then cuss you out and say it loud 
 The first generation of muthafuckas 
 To grab our nuts and say it proud 
 Country niggas or city niggas 
 Tupac niggas or biggie niggas 
 In the corridor, floor or door 
 And all my Mississippi niggas 
 We connected all throughout 
 The north, the east, the west, the south 
 And if a white boy say the shit 
 He'll still get punched right in the mouth 
 Country boys, city boys 
 Cadillacs, Rolly Royce 
 Whatever, long as we ridin' 
 Pretty girls, ghetto boos 
 On the boulevard, in the avenue 
 It's a long walk, now that we ridin' 
 All they got for you is a cell, my nigga 
 They want you dead or in jail without rebel, my nigga 
 In the streets, it's similar to hell, my nigga 
 But we gonna boss up and live well, my nigga 
 You see, all they got for you is a cell, my nigga 
 They want you dead or in jail without rebel, my nigga 
 In the streets, it's similar to hell, my nigga 
 But we gonna boss up and live well, my nigga
