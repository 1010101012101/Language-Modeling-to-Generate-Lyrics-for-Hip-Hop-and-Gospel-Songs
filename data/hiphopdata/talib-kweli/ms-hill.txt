Every night, slips away (phone ringing) 
 In other words, (yo, who's this?) I should say 
 There are no words, (y'all heard it) you should say 
 There are no words, (I mean it's life) 
 Every night, slips away (I mean, what can I say? it's best) 
 In other words, I should say 
 There are no words, you should say 
 There are no words 
 Ms. Hill, you got skills, that's a gift, it's real 
 Get ill, what you spit got the power to uplift the heel 
 I wish I could talk to Lauryn 
 I mean excuse me, Ms. Hill 
 And let her know how much we love her is real 
 The industry was beating her up 
 Then those demons started eating her up 
 She need a savior that'll bleed in a cup, yup 
 We used to kick it in the salad days 
 When she look at me like she ain't know me when she see me nowadays 
 I nod, she nod back, that's how it stay 
 Her songs still better than anything out there 
 Hotter power play 
 Remember how they accused her of saying 
 She did her album without help 
 Then she went to Rome to sing 
 And tell the Pope about herself 
 Just after she left the Fugees 
 Started rolling with the Marleys 
 Got back with her crew at Dave Chapelle's Block Party 
 She made songs about Zion 
 And trying to be faithful 
 Took the Blackstar on tour in Europe 
 I was so grateful 
 Speaking for myself but I'm sure I could speak for Dante 
 I got to watch a show with Nina Simone and Harry Belafonte 
 We used to chill at Nkiru, her moms was a customer 
 She used to love to buy the books by Octavia Butler 
 Parable of the Sower, the main character's name was Lauren 
 What the album did for black girls' souls was so important 
 I got concerned when she got sick on the road 
 She ain't heavy, I'm a brother 
 And I wish that I could pick up the load, but no 
 Every night, slips away 
 In other words, I should say 
 There are no words, you should say 
 There are no words 
 Another night slips away 
 In other words, I should say 
 There are no words, you should say 
 There are no words 
 Ms. Hill, you got skills, that's a gift, it's real 
 Get ill, what you spit got the power to uplift the heel 
 Got your assistant on the the phone 
 "I need to talk to Lauryn" 
 And I wanna walk through the storm, and I could be the umbrella 
 When the rain is pouring 
 Please, this no disrespect to whoever your man is though 
 This relationship is strictly music like D'angelo 
 I know you hate Babylon, and wanna see it fall 
 But they won't let you read your poem at the BET awards 
 You give us hope, you give us faith, you the one 
 They don't like what you got to say 
 But still they beg you to come, whoa 
 Now that's powerful sis, it's black power 
 We get money, keep our eyes on the final hour 
 And no I ain't saying you Christ, that would be sacriligous right? 
 But you can blow up the night, sisters the rats is vicious 
 The raps the sisters recite with their black fist up 
 The devil's last wish is a queen that rise past bitches 
 We used to read Francis Crest or anything 
 By Third World Press will press 
 But what the power of the word suggest 
 Hatched ideas in our heads like birds in the nest 
 You gave birth to a new sound like Don did West, yes 
 Should I be saying all of this while the mic is on? 
 I might as well let it out because one day I might be gone 
 I write this song and hope you feel how much we love you 
 And you play it, 'cause I really ain't got the words to say it 
 But yo 
 Every night, slips away 
 In other words, I should say 
 There are no words, you should say 
 There are no words 
 Another night slips away 
 In other words, I should say 
 There are no words, you should say 
 There are no words 
 Ms. Hill, you got skills, that's a gift, it's real 
 Get ill, what you spit got the power to uplift the heel
