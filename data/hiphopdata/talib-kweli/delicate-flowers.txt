My girl is a delicate flower, a super-hero 
 Being a single mom helped her develop the powers 
 We stay up to a elegant hour talking the hell and the sour 
 Reaching out to god cause the devil a coward 
 But he still sits on my shoulder and whispers 
 It feels like my shoulder gets colder the more that I listen 
 And now it seems like she ready to leave 
 We stay to beef the main reason my desire to spreading my seed 
 I try to tell her I'm just a man 
 She said "no, you're wrong, 'cause you're way more than that 
 You need to cut the scheme 
 You're not fooling me, this lunacy 
 Them excuses might be new to the birds, but they ain't new to me." 
 Yo, I hate when the fit is proun, is like 
 Everytime I pick up the phone you bitch moan, whoa 
 I'm like why you stressing for, press to the norm 
 Make me wanna never get involved 
 I need to rip these benefits 
 Uh, you so sensitive 
 I say serve this rarity 
 She say I deserve your loyalty 
 Girls have feelings 
 Men lie out of fear but we front like we're not afraid 
 Whether arguing or not, the bills gotta get paid 
 We are not in 6th grade, we're fighting and people watching 
 On tweeter she emo-blogging, I'm boiling the hemoglobin 
 And lead the side the arguments never move me 
 'Cause we acting out the stereotypes like Tyler Perry movies 
 My indiscretion is reeking in deep betrayal 
 The beat is on like horses, is hard to keep 'em stable 
 She believed me the way Michael believed in Fredo 
 But I need her, she the proof in my soul, my sweet potato 
 Before I let her go I know she'll be forever gone 
 I can't leave when the weather roam or weather storms 
 She like a tree, now got me looking for Fema 
 Cover in my neighbor's lawn the grass is looking greener 
 But in reality it never is 
 I'm sure there's others, but I'll never find a better 
 Girls have feelings 
 Girls have feelings 
 Girls have feelings 
 They surely, surely do
