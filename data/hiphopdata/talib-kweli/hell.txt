We know that what we reap we sow 
 But we forget how low we can go 
 You think it's bad here on Earth 
 But if we don't get to Heaven, it's Hell 
 It's all goin' to hell 
 It's all goin' to hell 
 Yup, we livin' in hell 
 Yup, they givin' us hell 
 It's all goin' to hell 
 It's all goin' to hell 
 Yup, we livin' in hell 
 Every Sunday dressin' up, catchin' gossip at its worst 
 Couldn't see the difference in the Baptist and the Catholic Church 
 Caught up in the rapture of the First Chapter and Second Verse 
 If we all God's children then what's the word of the reverend worth 
 Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facin' time 
 If we all made in God's image then that means his face is mine 
 Wait or it's that blasphemy, it's logical it has to be 
 If I don't look like my father then the way I live is bastardly 
 Naturally that's confusion to a young'n tryin' to follow Christ 
 Taught that if you don't know Jesus then you lead a hollow life 
 Never question the fact that Jesus was Jewish not a Christian 
 Or that Christianity was law accordin' to politicians 
 Who was King James, and why did he think it was so vital 
 To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible? 
 They say Hell is underground and Heaven is in the sky 
 And they say that's where you go when you die 
 But how they know? 
 We know that what we reap we sow 
 But we forget how low we can go 
 You think it's bad here on Earth 
 But if we don't get to Heaven, it's Hell 
 It's all goin' to hell 
 It's all goin' to hell 
 Yup, we livin' in hell 
 Yup, they givin' us hell 
 It's all goin' to hell 
 It's all goin' to hell 
 Yup, we livin' in hell 
 Yup, they givin' us 
 I've been to many churches, I've quoted many verses 
 I've dealt with my base self, I controlled my many urges 
 I used to study my lessons, it was a blessin' not a curse 
 I learned that heaven and hell exist right here on Earth, word 
 Studied with Rastafarians and learned from the dreads 
 That Hell is called Babylon 
 And that's where them crazy boarheads dwell 
 They got us thinkin' that Muslims like to make bombs 
 But real Muslims believe in paradise and the resist the Shaitan 
 So it all sound the same to me, that's why when they say 
 One is right and the other is wrong, it just sound like game to me 
 It's like God skipped past the church and came to me 
 No, that ain't vain to me 
 It's just a particular way that I came to see 
 The difference between those who claim to be 
 Religious and those that say they spiritual and recognize 
 That life is full of miracles, you could see my glow in a rhyme 
 The poem divine 'cause it coincide with a grow in the time 
 That those who lookin' for God knowin' to go inside 
 We know that what we reap we sow 
 But we forget how low we can go 
 You think it's bad here on Earth 
 But if we don't get to Heaven, it's Hell 
 It's all goin' to hell 
 It's all goin' to hell 
 Yup, we livin' in hell 
 Yup, they givin' us hell 
 Yup, we livin' in hell 
 Yup, they givin' us hell 
 Yup, we livin' in hell 
 Yup 
 Livin' in mass confusion, lookin' for absolution 
 The gas induces psychopath, produce the last solution 
 Based on his interpretation of what the words were sayin' 
 Tryin' to get to God but ended up doin' the work of Satan 
 Religion create division, make the Muslim hate the Christian 
 Make the Christian hate the Jew 
 Make the rules of faith that you condition to 
 And gotta to follow and God forbid you go to Hell 
 But if you ever walked through any ghetto 
 Then you know it well 
 [Incomprehensible] after me 
 Preacher says, he's blasphemy 
 I say there's gotta be a better explanation 
 [Incomprehensible] you 
 I pray that God hears you 
 Take one look at your rear view 
 And if you see what I see 
 (Incomprehensible) 
 We know that what we reap we sow 
 But we forget how low we can go 
 You think it's bad here on Earth 
 But if we don't get to Heaven, it's Hell 
 It's all goin' to hell 
 It's all goin' to hell 
 Yup, we livin' in hell 
 Yup, they givin' us hell 
 It's all goin' to hell 
 It's all goin' to hell 
 Yup, we livin' in hell 
 Yup, they givin' us hell 
 We know that what we reap we sow 
 But we forget how low we can go 
 You think it's bad here on Earth 
 But if we don't get to Heaven, it's Hell 
 Hell, hell, hell, hell 
 Hell, hell, hell 
 We know that what we reap we sow
