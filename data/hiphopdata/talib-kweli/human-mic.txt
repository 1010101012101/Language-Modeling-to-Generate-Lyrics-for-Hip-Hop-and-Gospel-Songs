I exhibit characteristics of the average misfit 
 Who graduated from stabbing and grabbing a biscuit 
 It's sick and tragic how antagonistic we get 
 When it's no power go sour 
 I seen him crossing a bridge by the masses 
 Covered in the ashes of both towers 
 Made it in New York and the way that we talk 
 Make it to North and that's a gift 
 Refuse to back, lay to mourn, and then tore it over 
 Look out for shooters that we're popping up at the opera 
 The popular, adore his pain for the sins of the god father 
 Popular music got 'em confused with killers and artists 
 I kill it the hardest competition dearly departed 
 They feeling some sort of way 'cause my flow revealing the garbage 
 I'm making 'em throw it up, you just making the people vomit 
 When it comes to this rhymin' I'm a legend like too common 
 Or the Chupacabra, the way I move it together it's how I knot 'em 
 Make them acclaim my cover, you daquiri with the 
 The Amarretta, you're sweet as a girly drink 
 Throw it back, cognac, I'm the best, you know that 
 You can have your own opinion, but not your own facts 
 On track as the most prolific ever, the most consistently 
 Vicious, New York can rip you, be ripping it like a shred 
 Some symphony hall shit, getting higher than your faucet 
 Getting better, trouble pearl of your jam like Eddie Vedder 
 Very fed up with self appoint and preserved us with past errors 
 That never seen their reflection when they're walking past mirrors 
 They got bitten and now they're smitting with the taste of blood and ticking 
 They taking enough drugs for the sleeping and keeping it fucking and make it up 
 Raise the bar and the waiters up 
 Others hating, just confused, undergo the way to luck 
 The eyes are the window to the souls and my shades is up 
 Advocate for artists, regardless 'cause I got faith in us 
 For the worthless who don't get paid enough 
 Take the bus, hands way too rough for the paper cuts 
 As far as they're concerned from on the table on the way to love 
 Take a slump, feel it to raise a child, you got to raise it up 
 Raise it up, raise it up, raise it up, take it up, take it up
