Yo Tone what we need? 
 (Dion) 
 More love, less hate, more real, less fake, more grind, less wishing 
 Less stuntin, more fame, less talking, more changes, less rushin', more vision 
 More franchising less sanitizing 
 More uprising less downsizing 
 More enterprising less sympathizing 
 More building, less destroying 
 More jobs less unemployment 
 Let's give the devil less enjoyment 
 More originality less biting off 'Pac and Big 
 More community activism less pigs 
 More Blacksmith and Def Jux less Geffen 
 And the rest cause the rest suck 
 They got the shit all messed up 
 More marijuana less coke 
 More countability for politicians before he shoutin' "Let's vote!" 
 More schools less prisons 
 More freestyles less written 
 More serious shit and less kidding 
 More history less mystery 
 More Beyonce less Brittany 
 More happiness less misery 
 More victory less losses 
 More workers, we all bosses 
 Of course its Reflection... 
 What we need? 
 (Dion) 
 More love, less hate, more real, less fake, more grind, less wishing 
 Less stuntin, more fame, less talking, more changes, less rushin', more vision 
 God bless the hood where my money always good 
 I can get you taken now thinkin' couldn't when I could Son I live above the rim and Paid in Full like my nigga would 
 Crack is old, niggas wish 
 Y'all wish a nigga would crack a joke 
 Like he wanna battle for the mic 
 This is Brooklyn, the planet 
 Y'all niggas is just satellites 
 Revolve around my every word 
 I address the crowd like Lincoln at Gettysburg 
 Surrounded by the heavy herb 
 The crowd is more or less 
 Wall to wall here for the pure 
 Hip-hop how I'm rockin' got them droppin' they jaw 
 Fire marshall blocking the door 
 There's a crack like they chopping the raw 
 This the shit the cops stopping us for 
 This the +Reign Of The Tec+ and them motherfucking Beatnuts 
 Slice like the nip-tuck 
 Specialize in deep cuts 
 It's the music that you ridin' to 
 Provided to you by Kweli and Hi-Tek the livest two... 
 Yeah, what we need? 
 (Dion) 
 More love, less hate, more real, less fake, more grind, less wishing 
 Less stuntin, more fame, less talking, more changes, less rushin', more vision 
 The more I put into it, the less it sounds like the nonsense 
 The more natural the less conscience 
 At the same time the more bomb shit 
 The less the devil got a grip 
 I get it loose we gotta slip away, the ghetto gotta get 
 More for a dollar 
 More Frescas for purchase 
 Less liquor stores 
 Less churches that be lookin' like corner stores 
 More rap songs that stress purpose with 
 Less misogyny and less curses 
 Let's put more depth in our verses, till they left on the surface 
 While we stomp through the underground 
 The comp don't come around 
 You sort of hoping for that reflection 
 You're sort of open I'ma heed call him chosen 
 I don't play with your emotion 
 Stop acting so God damn emotional 
 I give you these bars for free like it's promotional 
 This ain't no marketing strategy 
 It had to be from the heart in order to be reality 
 Reflection... 
 What we need?
