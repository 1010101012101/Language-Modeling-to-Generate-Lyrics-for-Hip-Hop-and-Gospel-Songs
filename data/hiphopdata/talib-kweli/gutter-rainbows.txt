Talib Kweli 
 Get wit it get wit it 
 Here we go here we go come on come on 
 Here we go here we go come on come on 
 Blacksmith 
 It's the movement 
 Keep it moving keep it moving 
 Here we go here we go come on come on 
 Here we go here we go come on come on 
 Blacksmith 
 Pay attention 
 Gutter rainbows 
 Watch me flip it like the Blacksmith logo 
 I shine a light through the darkness when the night is black as Yaphet Kotto 
 All these rappers looking mad in photos 
 Saddest player braggadocio quality make up for what a lack a promo 
 You say you blast a fo-fo you don't shoot 
 More like you shot me an email but forgot to attach the vocals 
 Call 'em a bastard like their dad a no show 
 I'm too fast for slow pokes running on the track with Yohji Yamamoto's 
 This ain't fashion rap I'm bringing the passion back 
 Find me where the trouble at that's my natural habitat 
 I take it with me in the booth 
 To delivery or respect to the dead we only owe the truth 
 So if somebody feeling disrespected even when his face is smiling 
 His heart rate escalate to violence 
 Look at them tremble juggling drugs 
 Using abusing beautiful struggling they were usually bubbling 
 It's the voice of the voiceless hope for the hopeless 
 Spit game way to real they don't promote it 
 Cause the way I approach it from another angle 
 I stay in the streets and notice the gutter rainbows 
 It ain't no pot o' gold it's where the products sold 
 It's where we lock and load and and cop that rock then roll 
 So turn it up loud and turn it up now 
 Turn it up loud turn it up now 
 Welcome to my hood where the rainbows is in the gutter 
 The pain that you will discover is making the angels shutter 
 There's sex in the city but we never claimed to love her 
 I know you heard of us we're more murderous than Cain famous brother 
 Living with death smoking blunts with the Grim Reaper 
 Snitch niggas known to blow the whistle like a gym teacher 
 This gum flapper swear he a gun clapper 
 Nah sum'n backwards he really a dumb rapper 
 The trap on the corner with the oil spilling 
 Mixed with the dirt and the water collected in the gutter till the colors brilliant 
 I paint pictures so legendary 
 I been doing this your history is as short as the month of February 
 In a leap year what do we fear 
 Dead bodies lying on the ground nothing to see here 
 Be clear don't ever cross me like police lines 
 Cause libertarians will be not invited to tea time 
 It's the voice of the voiceless hope for the hopeless 
 Spit game way to real they don't promote it 
 Cause the way I approach it from another angle 
 I stay in the streets and notice the gutter rainbows 
 It ain't no pot o' gold it's where the products sold 
 It's where we lock and load and and cop that rock then roll 
 So turn it up loud and turn it up now 
 Turn it up loud turn it up now 
 Saw that [?] whip around a building to form a corner tornado 
 Finding nature in the city we cover our feet in gators 
 Bugatti's to bodegas they selling rotten tomatoes 
 Stacking chips and I don't mean potato there go another one 
 Graduated from quarter waters and Butter Crunch 
 Tuxedo nice with a gun tucked in his cummerbund 
 He get it from his mama he ain't nothing but his mother's son 
 She used to get it popping like bubblegum 
 Peddling poison was often better employment 
 The ghetto destroying any sense of self she was enjoying 
 Survival of the fittest by any means necessary 
 Got us calling drug dealers revolutionaries 
 You say he kill his people he say I feed my family 
 And you ain't kickin in you'll never understand me 
 You just stand in my way now you an obstacle 
 And obstacles end up in the hospital 
 It's the voice of the voiceless hope for the hopeless 
 Spit game way to real they don't promote it 
 Cause the way I approach it from another angle 
 I stay in the streets and notice the gutter rainbows 
 It ain't no pot o' gold it's where the products sold 
 It's where we lock and load and and cop that rock then roll 
 So turn it up loud and turn it up now 
 Turn it up loud turn it up now
