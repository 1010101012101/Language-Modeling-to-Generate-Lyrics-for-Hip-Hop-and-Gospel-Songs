 You niggaz superstitious don't step on the cracks or split the poem 
 Candle light, flickers so bright, I feel the wick can kick a sicka flow 
 And spill it like a liquor store, I spit the shit to make a cripple get up and dance 
 I spit the shit to make the average MC piss in his pants 
 I spit the shit to make a mothafucker call it a night 
 I spit the shit to see fuck wit C. Delores Tucker sex like 
 I take a sip from my creative well, in this game for a minute 
 I play this well to win it, ya go to Africa like dave chappelle, you finished 
 Cause ya prehistoric raps is borin, the number of whack rappers soarin 
 Like the percentages of teenagers who have abortions 
 These niggaz meak they lyrics weak, and they beats is corporate 
 They try snitchin on records their mouths is leakin ??? 
 Drippin 'em ova system than, Chinese water torture 
 Rippin a series of events, more unfortunate than lemony snicket

 And prostitutes front

 Monstas that rap, buzzed out ?? check the cadence of the frequency 
 Uniquely, we strong arms strategically 
 Easily I twist the ?? killa cali ?? 
 Back alleys burnin backwoods in danelis or 
 He probably wit kweli, out in BK 
 We make it easy for the djs, like instant replays 
 Conversation by the buttons, I talk and touch sumpin 
 Straight shots of the luey he flew me out to london 
 Crunchin numbers flippin more dough, like siccisero
