Yeah 
 Ludacris in this mutha fucka 
 What up talib disturbin tha peace god damnit we just gettin' started 
 Mix tape style goes like this 
 Look here 
 Now ludacris out the gate and damnit its huntin season 
 When you shot remember everything happens for a reason 
 And you never hit it right 
 That's why I'm snatchin your girl 
 She calls me mr. drummin 
 'Cause different strokes rule the world 
 I got a thirst for knowledge and an appetite for drama 
 Or appetite for destruction and a thirst for your mama 
 Either way I keep it goin' till that thing is empty 
 Been nice since mike tyson punched soda popinsky 
 Chicks keep gettin' stung 'cause they all in my swarm 
 Plus I step in they dorm they get more tears than norm 
 Its 2004 the world needs more lesbians 
 And more drunk drivers to hit drunk pedestrians 
 They walk around here with two left feet 
 A warm milk and a cold gat'll put your ass to sleep 
 How many streets steal no matter how ugly it seems 
 Long as I got on my bullet proof buddy lee jeans 
 Nigga 
 Yeah, it's like that 
 It's like that 
 It's like that 
 It's like that 
 Mutha fucka! 
 Kweli and crips niggas never heard no shit like this 
 I got your chick feelin' moist 
 You comin' softer than the ad in the back of the village voice 
 You still a toy, the cops is still a boy 
 They tryin' to get me to vote by sayin' the lesser of two evils is still a choice 
 Well maybe and maybe not 
 Niggas rhymin like the guy 80 glock 
 I'm home watching I love the 80s 
 Stop 
 Picture the ocean with the panoramic view 
 My flow the iceberg that the titanic ran into 
 Ooah 
 Rock like suicide vicitims with red flannel 
 Why your rhymes sound like they was written for clear channel 
 We used to drive to 50 states and hear 50 flows 
 Now every city knows sames songs its just again pimps and hos 
 And the kids think the key to gettin' down in the game 
 Is to copy the hot nigga and start soundin the same 
 Now you tryin' to be heard but your shouts in vain 
 'Cause you drowned out by the buzz that's surroundin my name 
 Kweli 
 It might be somethin' that you can't pry from me 
 Shut out the eye 20s see my rhymes good money 
 We're rollin' with akmed and durba swervin the streets 
 We're shaka zoolo shana and luda disturbin tha peace 
 I murdered the beat 
 I'm the nightmare that recur in your sleep 
 A word in the flesh like the wafer that the nun got converted to eat 
 Takin' the lamb of god herded the sheep 
 A whole flock of __ nigga do you believe 
 Yo wats poppin' it's the kid kain 
 Ya my nigga ludacris 
 My homeboy my dawg my brother from another mother 
 Talib kweli 
 And this is how we do man 
 Hate it or love it 
 Guess who fresher than I 
 D dies red and black lumber jack 45 in his levis 
 He has his knees highs 
 I watch eazy e rise 
 Put LA on nomatic but they ain't believe nas 
 That was 96 in the g __ 
 Told me they gon believe start writin rhymes after BIG died 
 Eyes puffy some niggas sayin' fuck me 
 'Cause I'm from the west I'm fresh and I idolize dougie 
 Now NY love me still niggas wanna hate 
 I'm embraced by 50 states and the westside love me 
 Benz told dre I'm the nigga to chase 
 And it been that way since the beef with jigga and mase 
 In my chuck taylors red ones with the fat laces 
 Ten khakis desert eagle with the hollow tip laces 
 Fresh white tee yellow rocks in my necklace 
 Real gangsters drink 40 ounces for breakfast 
 I eat fat burgers three times a day 
 So fuck you if you don't like the red paint on my 6 straight 
 I was born in the hood, I be who I be 
 And me and kweli is like mack 10 and dub c
