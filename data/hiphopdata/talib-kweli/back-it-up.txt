(Talib Kweli Verse 1) 
 A n-gga Kweli be snapping like photographers 
 Black star in the constellations like Andromeda 
 You try to start it up 
 But you not hard enough 
 That's why your career is shorter than retarded 
 Club owner gave you bottles, you the shit now 
 This shit costing twenty dollars who the pimp now 
 Stop standing on the coach homie, sit down 
 I'm at the bar but you're chick is getting this round 
 They call your girlfriend a beard, need shaving 
 You brag about what you spend so much you need saving 
 You need shaking cause you buckle under pressure 
 You can keep fronting but nobody does it better 
 Yeah, I hop on any track, peep how I switch lanes 
 This the highway of life, check the whip game 
 Check the side of my neck you see the big vein 
 Just cause you have dragon breath don't mean you spit flames 
 These n-ggas soft man, they sweeter than glucose 
 Gimme fifty feet homie or you too close 
 Personal space n-gga back it up 
 Beep beep, back it up 
 Beep beep, back it up 
 Wait a minute 
 These n-ggas soft man, they sweeter than glucose 
 Gimme fifty feet homie or you too close 
 Personal space n-gga back it up 
 Beep beep, back it up 
 Beep beep, back it up 
 Wait a minute 
 (Talib Kweli Verse 2) 
 Ayo my penmanship f-cking up your face like a bleamish do 
 Keep it banging like red and blue 
 The instrumental through 
 Killing shit, you ain't got a chance 
 You and your man is through 
 Inspiration, ran into my music like xanadu 
 You rolling through, with a rent a crew 
 And a rented crew 
 Ten of you, way too many dudes 
 Soft as betty boo 
 Steady you, talking all that sh-t 
 In them interviews 
 Annie who? shit is pitiful 
 I had to get at you 
 Spit at you, like it's Tupac at the camera 
 You ain't got no hammers bruh, talking streetsweepers 
 You a muthaf-cking janitor 
 I'm the realest n-gga that you ran into 
 Can it bruh, the shit you spit faker than the tits on Pamela Anderson 
 Catch me in the Manderin, post it up 
 Ghetto's near you, catch a close up 
 I walk through any hood like respect it 
 Cause the flow tough, grow up 
 Personal space homie, back up
