Hey how you doing 
 We all gonna be like a bunch of little Fonzi's 
 What's Fonz he's cool 
 Meet Mr. International on the runway more than a fashion show, you know 
 It's all I love like McEnroe but sorry I have to go 
 One more time yo 
 Meet Mr. International on the runway more than a fashion show, you know 
 It's all I love like McEnroe but sorry I have to go 
 Nigel Hall: 
 I've been so many places in my life and time 
 And I know this for sure I'm a life that's worth living 
 I've seen a lot of faces made a lot of moves 
 I'm international cause of you 
 I've been so many places in my life and time 
 And I know this for sure I'm a life that's worth living 
 I've seen a lot of faces made a lot of moves 
 I'm international cause of you 
 Yo let me introduce you to the Blacksmith crew we making money 
 Go to sleep with a dream and we waking up hungry 
 It's a new day stomach is rumbling oh well 
 I'm like Lloyd Banks stumbling outta the hotel 
 Overseas show I'm catching the last flight 
 Really need to go I'm hangover from last night 
 Out with Gina and Mila [?] we get silly 
 Had a ball bout to call a cab like Wet Willie's 
 When I'm in commuter traffic I'm never worried or panic 
 First class travel I'm flying Virgin Atlantic 
 I'm already checked in I'm ready to settle in 
 Going places I've never been I get my Rosetta in 
 Racking up the sky miles and getting them upgrades 
 And you hate the only place that you visit is upstate 
 Don't be mad 'cause I'm writing this rhyme on my iPad 
 Don't be sad cause tomorrow I'm catching the flight back 
 Nigel Hall: 
 I've been so many places in my life and time 
 And I know this for sure I'm a life that's worth living 
 I've seen a lot of faces made a lot of moves 
 I'm international cause of you 
 I'm a traveling man moving through places space and time 
 Thinking life hard working at your 9 to 5 
 No matter what you do you can't imitate my grind 
 24/7 love ain't that rough 
 When your career is you're passion no that ain't enough 
 So when you hear me rapping it's like I'm making love 
 Banging your eardrum slinging that good ugh 
 Taking over the planet you follow my footprints now you rolling with the greatest 
 I'm getting to know the neighbors I'm tasting the local flavors 
 Chicks from the ghetto were richer than portobello 
 My life is like a movie a novel by Paulo Coelho 
 Or the Steely Dan song about a bottle of Cuevo 
 Colombian Gold take a hit for the road 
 Its given me a vision like I was licking a toad 
 Consider me so blessed like mama making a cake 
 And the kids licking the bowl 
 Nigel Hall: 
 I've been so many places in my life and time 
 And I know this for sure I'm a life that's worth living 
 I've seen a lot of faces made a lot of moves 
 I'm international cause of you 
 I've been so many places in my life and time 
 And I know this for sure I'm a life that's worth living 
 I've seen a lot of faces made a lot of moves 
 I'm international cause of you
