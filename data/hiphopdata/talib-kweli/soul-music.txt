(Talib Kweli) 
 Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-Madlib invasion - music please! 
 (Female singer) 
 Music, it makes me feel so good 
 Early in the morning it makes me, feel like I'm open 
 And I'm strollin 
 There are times that, the music, it just, it just lets me unwind 
 I said 
 Music makes you love, it make you feel, it make it true, it makes it real 
 It can make you move 
 It can make you mewl or pray or stare into yourself until you hear the voice 
 And I, hear the voice inside 
 It's a celebration, yeah 
 It's a celebration, I hear music 
 (Male singer) 
 There are times I wanna give up 
 Then I remember this gift, that God has given to me 
 He's living through me 
 You see the vision through me... 
 Music make you love, it make you feel, it make it true, it make it real 
 It can make you move 
 It can make you mewl or pray or stare into yourself until you hear the voice 
 And I, hear the voice inside 
 (Female singer) 
 It's a celebration, yeah yeah 
 It's a celebration, that never let me down 
 It makes me feel so good 
 Early in the morning it makes me, feel so like I'm just floatin 
 And strollin, there are times that 
 The music just lets me unwind 
 Music~!
