Welcome to the new age where they're thirsty for that Kool-Aid 
 Thirsty for first in that page, really thirsty just to be fake 
 Be the first to hate what you say, trying to diss you calling you "gay" 
 Such an urgent need to express yourself, but really nothing to say 
 Don't fuck with us, we too tough, get high like you do drugs 
 Like spit me out I'm chewed up my life is chopped and screwed up 
 I know you up in this club, I know you don't give a fuck 
 You told me what you don't like, you made that clear, now what do you love? 
 There's gotta be more 
 Some live the life of the rich, some people gotta be poor 
 I've been through a door 
 I will not sell you a dream, that's what the lottery for 
 The music is clay, I shaped it, I molded it 
 Like it was pottery or the mouth with the law 
 Twist it like Robert Duvall, son, the godfather raw 
 Free as the diamond you found on the floor 
 Furnished the rhyme with the proper decor 
 I burnished the nine in my mind with the galore 
 So they burning with shaman, I'm popping the door 
 To top off the law 
 If your style is married to substance, you sound like you got a divorce 
 That's why I'm blocking and unfollowing y'all 
 I done forgot what I'm following for 
 Enough about y'all, now back to me 
 Ain't no academic leave, I'm not faculty 
 These new slaves ain't ready for my masterpiece 
 So when they hear me rap it's catastrophe 
 Cause a casualty so casually they mistake what I do for having beef 
 I don't actually wish anybody harm, now stretch your arms and clap for me 
 Wake up cause no you're not dreaming 
 Catch up with us 'cause we leaving 
 Got enough followers 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 Got enough followers 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 Wake up cause no you're not dreaming 
 Catch up with us 'cause we leaving 
 Got enough followers 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 Got enough followers 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 Ever since the day I was born, that marks the day I was chosen 
 To rise above them all and be a leader, I'm like Malcolm X when on the podium 
 Martin Luther with a dream, Rosa Parks on the bus 
 Though as funny as it seems it remind me of us 
 Through the money and the fame ain't shit gon' change for the light we adjust 
 Do it for the children without a ceiling to live up under 
 Times getting hard, that's why my niggas smoke that tropic thunder 
 If all our people spread love instead of evil 
 We would prosper our conscious to a level with no equal lethal 
 Stay true, I gave you my oath 
 What would the ancient God my nigga Thoth 
 Through all the books and the screens I was taught 
 I look at myself and pretend to learn the most 
 Our leaders dead and gone, what's left for the believers? 
 If you looking for the truth, one word: Underachievers, nigga 
 Wake up cause no you're not dreaming 
 Catch up with us 'cause we leaving 
 Got enough followers 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 Got enough followers 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 Wake up cause no you're not dreaming 
 Catch up with us 'cause we leaving 
 Got enough followers 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 Got enough followers 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 As I change the so called predestined course of my life 
 Advance my shit so now I travel at the speed of light 
 Moving these intricate insecurities out of sight 
 Moving myself onward from the darkness into the light 
 I take flight, it's goodbye to all the negativity 
 That plague millions of young innocent souls like me 
 Gave me the genius mind state necessary 
 To feast off of this unlimited figurative tree 
 Of life, I tried to tell these niggas that our purpose is to move it 
 Something like Darwin's beliefs of humans in evolutions 
 As I fall asleep on these social forms of materialism 
 I wake up and go through more colors than your normal prism 
 Would you rest my soul, I'm blinding me to a blurry of visions 
 In light of me on what to cut with such gifted precision 
 And now I'm truly livin' (bless up, bless up) 
 And now I'm truly livin' (bless up, bless up) 
 Wake up cause no you're not dreaming 
 Catch up with us 'cause we leaving 
 Got enough followers 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 Got enough followers 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 Wake up cause no you're not dreaming 
 Catch up with us 'cause we leaving 
 Got enough followers 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 I'm looking for some new leaders 
 Got enough followers
