Thinking of the master plan 
 Where there's nothing but cash inside my hand 
 Wanna dig into my pocket my profit is ever set 
 I dig deeper, you know I represent, represent 
 Yeah, money over bitches, my sisters go over everything 
 My bandz will make you dance forever, just like a wedding ring 
 Barb of the haters, the jealousy that the cheddar bring 
 Trying to get away from this 85's like Evelyn 
 Ride with me, I got 'em leaking like Nene 
 Got 'em leaking like Mickey, these monkeys biting like hickeys 
 'Cause they're seeing what I'm doing, filling them with confusion 
 Cut edges like a chewing, I'm flowing just like a student 
 Of the romance languages, only the diamonds hang with us 
 My meal is decorated with garnish just like your wages is 
 The crib's outrageous like really it's no joke 
 The girl of your dreams be coming over to smoke 
 Turn it up loud, turn it up loud 
 Turn it up loud, turn it up loud 
 Drop it, stop it 
 With all the soap operas and the soap boxes 
 Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, for the people 
 You can feel the heat from your speaker, my sound will darken your features 
 Run it down like a zebra, I move with the speed of cheetahs 
 I'm from Brooklyn where the heat is the size of a two-litre 
 I ain't asking for no followers, I'm looking for new leaders 
 Is hard not consuming all the bullshit they feed us 
 Intravenous like a cord to the womb from the fetus 
 Been hard since I started reading, alliteration is literally littered 
 Through my DNA swimming on through my semen 
 So every time I bust, babies begin being born 
 Talk turns tough till them toasters that's tucked, yeah 
 Draw it like a picture, picture a perfect painting 
 Police profiling people peacefully praying 
 Lay the law like leadears the lazy as lolly 
 Gagging on my ground, getting guap cause green is the new black 
 Meet me at the bar, we throwing a few back 
 Hopped out the car, you know who blew that 
 Turn it up loud, turn it up loud 
 Turn it up loud, turn it up loud 
 Drop it, stop it 
 With all the soap operas and the soap boxes 
 Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, for the people 
 Ayo we drink good, smoke good 
 This cat wearing funny hats like the pope wore 
 I come in looking quite clean in the loafer 
 So hood, might scheme up to no good 
 You know crook got sling in the notebook 
 I got the birds on the wire like I know I would 
 I still rep POC's like I'm supposed to 
 Come alive and down throw like I know I should 
 My rhymes like a laser beam - so focused 
 I'm in the ring so lean I need a phone? 
 I ain't lying, Batista Ferocious 
 Maybe I'm lying bare feet in the ocean 
 On the beach fall asleep and I'm floating 
 To the beat so unique like a potion 
 I love music, I'm complete in my devotion 
 (Word, say it again) 
 I'm complete in my devotion 
 Turn it up loud, turn it up loud 
 Turn it up loud, turn it up loud 
 Drop it, stop it 
 With all the soap operas and the soap boxes 
 Turnt up, turnt up, turnt up, for the people
