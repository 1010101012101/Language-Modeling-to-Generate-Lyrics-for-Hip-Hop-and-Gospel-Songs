As a kid growing up in brooklyn, my pops was a DJ 
 He had a bunch of records: Funk, jazz, rhythm and blues, soul 
 Know what I'm sayin' 
 There was this one gospel record I liked, like, like 
 Like Holy Molly, I might get some religion and leave ya holy holy, ya this rhyme so fat its rolly polly 
 Ill give intimate details so you can get to know me, 
 These corporate rapers like why this dude pickin' on me 
 You rap your way to the top but now its gettin' lonely, 
 Kids is hungry and you lookin' like steak from nick and tony's 
 But don't nobody want your jewels cause ya shit is phony 
 Say word yo shit is real, yo shit is corny, 
 Rhymes turn a new page like mark foley 
 And touch kids like when larry clark gave the part to chloe, 
 Rest in peace to Harold Hunter, the greatest from New York 
 Who started out skating for Zoo York, word 
 Hangin' out at the gavin, I was very lucky 
 The talk to rash once I got past Darren Dudley, 
 Got him on respiration that's pre-Badu 
 Bet you Garnett Reid got a Matt Doo tattoo, 
 Some times it feels like I'm drowning I gotta tread water 
 Head above the water I always remember headquarters 
 Heads up eyes open I got my mind focused 
 I find hope inside a line, my rhymes defines opus 
 Sometimes hopeless people fill my soul with evil 
 My record so hard it broke the needle, 
 At the mixtape awards niggas act like they don't give a fuck though 
 Disrespect the legacy of Justo 
 What the blood clot? no, let the blood flow 
 You ain't come to pay your respect then what you come fo, 
 Too many good niggas die, it's like a stop loss 
 Good niggas ghetto like fried wings and hot sauce, 
 How you hard the cops lettin 50 shots off 
 Baby jay-z's with the knock off Scott Storch 
 Beat you are not Short you are not Katt 
 You not a playa or a pimp money stop that, 
 Learn to masta your speech and be eloquent 
 Rappers keep peddlin sweets the beats weaker than gelatin, 
 We used to kick 'em dust and now we settling 
 Rest to peace to Dilla, Weldon we can't forget you 
 Professor x and proof we miss you word, 
 Rest in peace to Shakka, 21 gun salute in the air like 
 Bloc! Bloc! Bloc! 
 Still here cause your livin' through me 
 You're like a gift god give it to me. 
 Uh uh uh what!
