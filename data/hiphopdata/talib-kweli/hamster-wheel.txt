I see, yeah I see, see, I'm lookin' right at you, I eye-contact you 
 You see me, and I'm a beamie, uh 
 First, I'm sayin' hi, then I'm wavin bye-bye 
 We get in, we get in 
 Girl, you're so fly, you're so fly 
 Yo, these swallows is horny like charley parker 
 Be cutting 'em 'cause I'm studying these birds like ornithology 
 Follow 'em when they tweeting, holler instead of speaking 
 Give it a name, she played the wicked games every weekend 
 Broke up with a dude for almost ending a life 
 Came over for a closure, ended up spending the night 
 That cosy in this apartment, wine bottles started popping 
 Put scratches up on his back, they question him where he got them 
 Forgot it was her, she threaded him, fingers was like machetes 
 The fucking was so static, she shaded him like a faddic 
 Every single chick, she's like enough already 
 I need to be with someone else, this stuff is so petty 
 She once reacted to things he did in the past 
 Thinking it was no safe, he couldn't say no to the ask 
 The heavy so rash, she gave up all her power 
 He boarded out on the street, nowhere to live, nowhere to shower 
 How she gonna make it through the night? 
 How she's so accepting all this tension in her life? 
 She always carrying a baby with her 
 Her spitting image just like looking at her baby pictures 
 Afraid to say 'cause she dependent on man for real 
 How she running these streets but always standing still 
 She need to get up off the hamster wheel 
 She need to get up off the hamster wheel 
 How she running the streets but still standing still 
 She need to get up off the hamster wheel 
 She need to get up off the hamster wheel 
 Battery in the back, popping up with the cop 
 Top popular with the acid, the hot attack 
 Niggas whooping the holla out the drama 
 The way she passing the barber shop 
 Only job that's an option mcdonalds or telemarket 
 Often her asking together, this ain't the beatles 
 She need is a man like she going under needle 
 She doing so much cotton, it's a wonder she living 
 The money was so seductive, no wonder she ain't leaving 
 First time she fell like a woman was when a dude screamed 
 Nice ass out the car window driving past 
 Nobody showed her how to live so all she do is dream 
 They call her rocket cause the make-up is like the mash-bomb 
 Scars proeminently large on her frontal lobe 
 Behind bars for credit cards scheme she pulled a month ago 
 First she getting high, now we waving bye-bye 
 She's waiting out the station 
 Just the same as she's waiting out the station 
 Late at night for a train that never came 
 She always carrying a baby with her 
 Her spitting image just like looking at her baby pictures 
 Afraid to say 'cause she dependent on man for real 
 How she running these streets but always standing still 
 She need to get up off the hamster wheel 
 She need to get up off the hamster wheel 
 How she running the streets but still standing still 
 She need to get up off the hamster wheel 
 She need to get up off the hamster wheel
