(Feat. Lil'Flip) 
 (Chorus: E.S.G.) 
 Buy the car, buy the house 
 Fuck the wife, fuck the spouse 
 Throw the diamonds in our mouth 
 Realist rhymin in the south 
 Back to back, track to track 
 None of y'all niggas can't fuck wit that 
 E.S.G and Wreckshop you know we makin' paper stack 
 (Verse One: E.S.G.) 
 Buy the mansion, buy the Lexus 
 Buy the nine to squash the plexin 
 Showin them boys how Houston, Texas 
 Smoke weed, drivin' wreckless 
 The barbershop, haters knock 
 A nigga like me gonna bleed the block 
 Comin' down trunks pop tops drop 
 Comin' down we free to stock 
 Can't stop the shine bump and grind again 
 One slow up in ya slow independent top ten 
 I made mistakes in '98, 99 will be better 
 88 degrees feel like some pop roof weather 
 Hell what them haters say E.S.G on the scene 
 Platinum sole shuttin them doors but the game ain't complete 
 Until the fourth one release you niggas check yo shit 
 Another hit is all they get southwest will slang them hits 
 I'm da shit bitch!I know you smell the odor 
 Stretched cruise control I slam the doors on a Rover 
 Sippin syrup and soda maintain yo composer 
 E.S.G done signed with Wreckshop you know the games over 
 (Verse Two: Lil'Flip) 
 In my mouth diamonds glarin 
 Wearin nothin' but Donna Karen 
 Ridin' red turnin' heads, always keep a yellow starin' 
 Buy a house I'll buy the block 
 Buy the boat and I'm a buy the dock 
 Sittin' sideways still I hop 
 Watch the trunk still go pop 
 H-Town playas can't take the lost 
 Playin' football like Marshall Faulk 
 Sippin codine to cure my cough 
 Full time playa just like Big H.A.W.K 
 Make Em say Ugh like Master P 
 Do the body rock like P-A-T 
 Swang and bang like E.S.G 
 G's and Ballers like H.$.E 
 If I'm chillin' with a girl it gotta be a star 
 If I hold a white cup it gotta be the barre 
 Blue, black, or red don't touch my car 
 Screwed Up Click is who we are 
 25 lighters like D.M.D 
 20 inch rims on GMC's 
 Playstation flippin like GMG 
 To let the world know I'm Sucka Free 
 Like Botany Boys I'm Mr. G 
 Living the life of Luxury 
 F-L-I-P is who I be hittin a switch wit A.P 
 We millionaires and billionaires 
 Flyin to shows in a rocket 
 The money you make in a year I got that in my pocket! 
 (Verse Three: E.S.G.) 
 Better (?) ya to tux let the Klu Klux know 
 That I'm a blast ya 
 Heard how ya done James Byrd down up in Jasper 
 Ask Shawn, Chris, & Baby its time I kill 
 E.S.G and Platinum Sole that's ten thousand times a mill 
 So what's the deal all you fake snakes rattle still 
 Better guard yo grill better keep yo sill 
 A nigga get killed on the battle field 
 We popping pills and paying bills 
 Make a man steal for the scrill 
 They pop my pump back fuck a contract 
 All y'all gonna get killed 
 Scandlous skills no sex appeal 
 This is how it feels getting hit with a drill 
 Caps we peel high as a hill 
 And you know the crowds I thrill 
 And from here on to Nashville you know we lookin' trill 
 We still comin' down with the one minute grill 
 I done want no deal I'm a stay independent 
 I done want no deal I make a mill a minute 
 Then hit the mall and spend it 
 And you know I'm drippin wet 
 Comin' threw the door polo'ed down wit Noke D and D Reck 
 G's, some niggas be yellin' ki's, some niggas be yellin' hustlas 
 Some niggas be yellin' bustas, some niggas be yellin' glocks 
 Some niggas be yellin' nines 
 But to tell the truth y'all niggas ain't got a dime 
 Cause see we gonna... 
 (Chorus: repeat to end)
