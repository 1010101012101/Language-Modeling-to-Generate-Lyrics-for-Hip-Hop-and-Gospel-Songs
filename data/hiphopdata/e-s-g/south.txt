All right 
 This is yo everyday boppin bitch 
 And I'm lookin' for the niggas wit the drop top 
 Candy painted hittin the switch 
 So here's a blast for ya muthafuckin ass 
 Wit a dick in ya mouth 
 Straight from the muthafuckin south 
 Verse One: 
 Well it's the south 
 Nothin' but the muthafuckin south 
 Before ya say shit get my dick out cha mouth 
 Mr. E is who I be 
 OG fo 93 
 Studio BGs gets no L O V 
 To the east I'm feelin' hap 
 Was the hap white black 
 As I get funky then a jit jack 
 Then George Clint jock's rap 
 So bitches hold ya nose 
 Nigga watch cha hoes 
 We gon chunk dem 84s then blow the indo 
 I'm higher then an eagle 
 Rollin' deep in a regal 
 Divorce Desert Storm 
 Now I live wit desert eagles 
 Slap a hoe 
 Jack the sto' 
 I neva stole a flow 
 'Cause I'm tighter then a twat 
 And I knock on virgin hoe 
 So and if ya dick fit 
 'Cause it's dank and drink 
 Ya got me thinkin' by the quick lick 
 I'm big wit the .44 
 This ain't an indo 
 Got the money ese 
 Hell no 
 I'm out wit dat bum again 
 The fiends tongue numb again 
 The half pin sprung again 
 One dead Columbian 
 I'm I know it's gonna be he 
 Once the bird hit street 
 And the word hit the street 
 Dat I 
 Bought me a little crib in the Cristmonte 
 And last month a little punk could buy a blunt 
 I guess my life 
 'Cause Shife won't a ruin 
 But dat ain't shit biatch 
 Ya know what I'm doin' 
 It's the south 
 Comin' straight from the south 
 Fuckin' it up wit a blunt up in my mouth 
 It's the south 
 Comin' straight from the south (and I'm a OG) 
 Fuckin' it up wit a blunt up in my mouth 
 Verse Two: 
 Nothin' but a 
 O fuckin' G 
 And thank god dat it didn't happen in ninety-three 
 Jacked from a crab 
 I got fo my gold 
 Now my pockets look swoll 
 Like a nigga on parole 
 After doin' 10 L 
 Ain't cha fo a dime bag 
 Fienin fo a piece a pussy and some zig zags 
 But fuck it I'm gonna get mine 
 Kick mine and dick mine 
 Why ya lick mine and trick mine 
 Ya can't playa hate a true playa 
 So play dat Sega 
 Watch a nigga E page ya 
 Wit the rat tat tat tatta 
 To me it don't matta 
 Now who's in the backa 
 It looks like a jacka 
 I guess they wanna get me fo car today 
 But this ain't Tim 
 So I'ma show him a harda way 
 To not to fuck wit the E 
 And dat ain't nothin' but the south in me 
 And I'll be 
 Verse Three: 
 Watch cha back 'cause here I come 
 It ain't nothin' but dat bomb 
 From the nigga straight from dat muthafuckin south 
 Wit the fry in my hand and my dick in ya mouth 
 Droppin' dem bombs all muthafuckin day 
 We gotta have Bose 
 There's no date this ain't LA 
 It ain't nothin' but a nigga like the E 
 And yeah G it's nothin' but the south in me
