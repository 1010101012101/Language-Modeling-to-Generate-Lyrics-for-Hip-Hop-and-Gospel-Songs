I need a knot weather the bread is for me or not 
 I need a knot weather the bread is for me or not 
 I need a knot weather the bread is for me or not 
 Show me the spot 
 I had to get paper use to move white 
 Did it 24/7 morning noon night 
 Had to hit the block early in my true life 
 Scraping on the concrete in the moonlight 
 Powerful supply got that powder from the sky 
 I could always get it where you want it by tonight 
 Love the fluffy but I take it wet and hard 
 Push it off the sidewalk dump it in the yard 
 I'm hustler was cold blooded 
 All my customers their nose running 
 Got my muscles up pitching whole bundles 
 I ain't selling cocaine I had a snow shovel 
 I need a knot weather the bread is for me or not 
 I need a knot weather the bread is for me or not 
 I need a knot weather the bread is for me or not 
 Show me the spot 
 I use to chop green put it in a bag 
 Up and down the street let my money stack 
 They knew every week that I was coming back 
 No sticks kept it clean right and exact 
 Talking green sticky never brown crispy 
 Worse thing for my paper was when the drought hit me 
 I know my mama know because my pockets swoll 
 Soon as I walk through the door she smell it on my clothes 
 But I got to roll keep it pushing hot or cold 
 I gas it up I'm hitting every house on the road 
 Got to get it how I live I'm going hard for it 
 It ain't no marijuana man I push a lawn mower 
 I need a knot weather the bread is for me or not 
 I need a knot weather the bread is for me or not 
 I need a knot weather the bread is for me or not 
 Show me the spot 
 When I was sixteen I had crew of girls 
 Get them clean send them off out into the world 
 Use to come and see the kid to get their head right 
 Shorty talk all you want to just get my bread right 
 Never split the ends wasn't nothing soft 
 Had to get some trim then I cut them off 
 You know I bend their back I kept them in them tracks 
 You get some growth baby better bring them stacks 
 Steady go upside her head but she can't complain 
 I run that same old game baby no pain no gain 
 You got some paper and you trying to see some cuties holler 
 I ain't a pimp I'm sweeping hair at the beauty parlor 
 I need a knot weather the bread is for me or not 
 I need a knot weather the bread is for me or not 
 I need a knot weather the bread is for me or not 
 Show me the spot
