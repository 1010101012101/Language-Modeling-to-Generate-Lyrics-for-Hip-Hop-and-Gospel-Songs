Yo it's the Ox in the flesh, of course I'm fresh 
 Yes, I'm livin' for the funk like I was Lord Finesse 
 Last night I screamed till I lost my voice I guess 
 Had a few things left to get up off of my chest 
 Like I'm, facing the fact that I'm not, what my mom wanted 
 Only gold plaque that I got, had the Qu'Ran on it 
 I fliped your eviction notice over, wrote a song on it 
 Like to hear it, here it go, light your spirit, clear your soul 
 If I would've known that tonight was Ladie's Night 
 I would've stopped and swabbed my balls with the baby whipe 
 In the van, Hold your sorry little life in my hand 
 Watch me toss it in the sky and swing right for the stands 
 Battling me is like trying to ride your bike in the sand 
 I'ma eat one more helping, then I'm, whiping my hands 
 And you frustrated rappers, must hate the fact 
 That I walk in first class, have so much ladies gaspin for breath 
 Tryin' to catch me, with the ass and the chest 
 I ain't tryin' to be rude lady, I'm just passin a test 
 Got enough hastle and stress, with one woman cashing my cheques 
 I'll take the compliment and pass on the sex

 Brother Brother Brother, how ya making 'em get down 
 Come, straight to your town, vibrating the ground 
 Keep the people out there scared, of making a sound 
 That's our policy, we step out there on Star Quality

 You ain't hardcore, you soft more than Shamar Moore 
 In a tight shirt sayin' 'Let's slow this train down y'all 
 You stink hoes, spills a whole, lot of nothing 
 Got the nerve to look Ox in the eye, you got it coming 
 While your woman nod her face to the beat, you tasting defeat 
 Whiping the waste from my cleets, between the space in your teeth 
 Erogation, facial features all hung down 
 That little dumb frown is perfect for salt water to run down 
 Talk harder to some clowns, 'cause they need it rough 
 Make sure they never sleeping deep enough to dream of beating me, what 
 My styles a little belligerent, isn't it? 
 Considerin that I'm belittling them, with little more then 
 My pad and my pen and my sediments 
 Weither it's your chorus scratching, or wack track blasting, 
 Your whole approach to rapping, is ass crack backwards 
 Cats'll see me in the spot and act salty 
 Stressing you save hip hop, you can't even save a wack party

 Brother Ali is Two Hundred, Fifty Pounds of Piss and Vinegar 
 Few try to sit me down, they missing limbs and 
 I got nothing on, but a lifestyle, black tuxedo 
 An Arethra Franklin record, and I'm rockin' Captain Ego like 
 'Dun Dadda, Shit, Ya Done Poppa' 
 There's only three reasons Ali would need a Ramada 
 One; to move the bowels, two; to steal the towels 
 Three; Shave, shower, pray for my spiritual power 
 I can handle this, if my man Ant would just 
 Give me a chance to splatter some antics across his canvisses 
 Damage is unavoidable at this point 
 I twist joints till they pop lock, too loud and get ya knot rocked (?) 
 I'm too proud to let you hop scotch through 
 The section of the Earth that I occupy, without making you testify 
 Best that I could do for you, is ingore you 
 Cause Id probably conquer you if I explore you 
 Words from the Brother.
