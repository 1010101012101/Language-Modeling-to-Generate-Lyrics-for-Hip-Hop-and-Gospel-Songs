 Singing this song let the whole world know 
 Blood on our hands its wetter than it ever was 
 We say it's getting better yet it seldom does 
 Everybody wanna fuss but what gets discussed 
 When it's all said and done what will be said of us 
 This is who we are not who we have to be 
 In the lasting aftermath of a tragedy 
 Don't wanna talk no more I heard it all before 
 I just know that I don't want this on my heart no more 
 Speeding on a crash course with our final hour 
 Only thing that can bring us back is our finest hour 
 Excellence flow from every precious soul is the 
 Only way that I know to harness that kind of power 
 We can shine brighter sing bigger love louder 
 We can dream farther hope harder work smarter 
 This is that moment sand flowing through the hour 
 Glass is our only opponent that we have 
 Singing this song let the whole world know 
 Let the choir sing 
 Singing this song let the whole world know 
 Let the choir sing 
 Singing this song let the whole world know 
 Let the choir sing 
 Singing this song let the whole world know 
 All around the world different song same message 
 Dignigty in that spolight and life's precious 
 When we raise voices we're joining a chorus 
 You're not a solo the harmony is enormous 
 Echo John Lennon we echo Nina Simone 
 We echo my brother chuck d that legacy lives on 
 And when the struggle stress you 
 Let it bless you keep you strong 
 And may your voice live on forever in that song

 And so if we want to get anywhere we have to be self loving 
 Enough, to be honest with ourselves, to do some soul 
 Searching. I'm not talking about soul searching to see what's 
 Inside our soul, we got to find out what the hell happened to 
 Our soul. we've got to find that shit. I want my humanity back 
 I want to be a human being again. I want to live in a fair world 
 We've got to decide to rejoin the human family again. we're 
 Not talking about just this case, we not talking about just 
 This issue, we're talking about weather or not we're going to 
 Be human beings again. peace!
