So I'm finally gettin' home from off tour 
 Been gone since I can' t even remember when 
 I start wakin' up in my bed not knowin' where I'm at man 
 The bad part is I look over at my wife 
 And like I don't know who this person is in my bed (Tell me is it real?) 
 I'm buggin' out 
 If I wake up in a hotel room 
 Or on the bunk of a bus 
 Middle of nowhere, shit I'm completely fine 
 But let me wake up in my crib 
 I get to flippin' my wig 
 Anywhere as long it isn't mine 
 I've been on the road seven 
 Out the past eight months 
 You wanna live you gotta give 
 Your lovin' fans what they want 
 So if they want the truth 
 You gotta tell 'em it's here 
 Ask Randy Hawkins man 
 I had a helluva year 
 My first headlining tour 
 My album in stores 
 And I finally got to see 
 What all that grindin' been for 
 To get down for the cause 
 And catch a round of applause 
 And to see the shit I spit 
 Get printed out in the source 
 My heroes brung me on tour 
 I said allahu akbar 
 Thank you God 
 I don't know what else 
 I could bother you for 
 Got me out in California 
 At this Wal-Mart store 
 With the lord rockin' 
 We chillin' shoppin' for drawers 
 I blew my little video budget 
 I figured fuck it 
 You only live once 
 You better entertain your public 
 I did freeze my nuts 
 In D.C. on a handy cam 
 On the white house lawn 
 Rappin' Uncle Sam Goddamn 
 Shook hands with Busy Bee 
 I said his line from Wild Style 
 The Bee part B and he smiled 
 So I'm out in the bay 
 With Fred Hampton Junior 
 Somebody made away 
 With my goddamn computer 
 I caught a flight home 
 On my 30th birthday 
 A gift courtesy 
 Of my main man MURS see 
 I needed to see my wife 
 And Faheem in the worst way 
 Ended up havin' both 
 A blessed an a cursed day 
 As I walked on stage 
 To give 'em these raps 
 My DJ's wife was on 
 That bridge that collapsed 
 She ended up breakin' her back 
 And gettin' roughed up 
 But she already walkin' 
 You bad mother fucker 
 It's real as can be 
 I keep my people with me 
 And that's B.K., Drinkula 
 And King So Key 
 Rhymesayers entertainment 
 And what more can I say? 
 Except I gotta brand new 
 Baby daughter on the way 
 (Tell me is it real?)
