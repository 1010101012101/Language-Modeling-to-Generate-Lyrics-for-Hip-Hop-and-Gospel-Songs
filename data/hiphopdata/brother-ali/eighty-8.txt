I was raised on the hip-hop 
 More raised in more ways than one 
 This is back when hip-hop was still fun. 
 When Public Enemy was still number one. 
 Before all the pro-black cats discovered guns. (No funds!) 
 Countin' money so me and my man skate to Kool Mo' G records 
 Makin' up hand-shakes 
 He's a damn fake to say he can't relate to Mike Tyson 
 Punch out, drinkin' up the Kool-aid and getting' cussed-out 
 Bust out in the evening, I'm free when I'm breathin' incense 
 And got the EPMDin'. 
 Back then an album was something you could listen to for 6 months straight 
 (Somebody slap me if that isn't true) 
 When my religion was hip-hop, Chris dropped the testament 
 That to this day got me wanna be intelligent 
 We didn't have a ??? back then 
 We had a ??? back then 
 I rock the green, black and yellow back then 
 When Foxy Brown was droppin' in the first train of thought we had dreams 
 But (rosy carrez??) is who we saw 
 Never said that I was old school but let me get it straight 
 This game has never been as straight as it was in '88 
 Various Cuts 
 Doin' my thang with an '89 swing 
 Kick this one here for me and my king 
 '89 the number, another summer 
 One one one one 
 The mic the man, the master plan 
 And if you need 'em I got crazy prophylactics 
 Had to climax when I max, relax and chill 
 Sit down eat your slice of pizza and be quiet (Slick RickMona Lisa) 
 Buddy Buddy Buddy all in my face 
 The J to the A to the M to the E 
 I'm talented yes I'm girfted 
 Nigga' please, you work for UPS 
 It's not about a salary, it's all about reality (KRS-One) 
 And the J-U-N-E-L-Y 
 I don't slur my words when I rap 'cause that's wack 
 Kick a hole in the speaker pull the plug than I jack 
 Crashhh! 2000 sucka's!
