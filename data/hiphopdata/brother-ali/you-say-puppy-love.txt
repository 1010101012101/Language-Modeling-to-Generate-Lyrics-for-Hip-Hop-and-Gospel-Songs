You say 
 I made you fall in love with me 
 Wish I could make you fall in love with you 
 You believe in the magic that us could be 
 And what that you and I means one can do 
 Every instinct you had said run from me 
 That this new found touch is uncomfortable 
 And to truly stand naked in front of me, or yourself 
 Well that there matter is something new 
 I take no pride knowing 
 That you avoid the mirror to shun what you despise 
 Never knew your beauty you came here with 
 Till the first time you caught your reflection in my eyes 
 Never you mind what I see in you 
 Grow because you're beautiful, not because I need you to 
 Grow till you outstretch every single piece of you 
 Heaven'll see you through but you gotta believe it's true 
 Go write your story 
 Even if in the end you might outgrow me 
 I'll always treasure the chapter that was mine 
 I twist through time with a smile knowing you're free 
 Puppy love is real to a puppy 
 I still want to feel you touch me 
 I'm not saying leave me 
 Please just be free 
 I love you so much 
 I don't want you to need me 
 Puppy love's real to a puppy 
 I still want to feel you up under me 
 I'm not saying leave me 
 Please just be free 
 I love you so much 
 I don't want you to need me 
 The sky all alone is glorious 
 We behold it but we can't hold it up 
 When God says 
 "That's it" 
 and hits the switch 
 It'll all come tumbling down when it's bored with us 
 Sweet you in all your radiance 
 I can please you but I can't save you, sis 
 I adore you and might even open up 
 But even I can't love you enough for both of us 
 Can't hold you close enough 
 Can't enter the holes you boarded up 
 Close your eyes, concentrate on my voice 
 Want to make your love for me pure? 
 Make it a choice 
 Puppy love is real to a puppy 
 I still want to feel you touch me 
 I'm not saying leave me 
 Please just be free 
 I love you so much 
 I don't want you to need me 
 Puppy love's real to a puppy 
 I still want to feel you up under me 
 I'm not saying leave me 
 Please just be free 
 I love you so much 
 I don't want you to need me 
 The sky is there to behold 
 You just want to be held when you're cold 
 Just grow, stretch out your soul 
 And if you still want me, I'll watch you grow old 
 The sky is there to behold 
 You just want to be held when you're cold 
 Just grow, stretch out your soul 
 And if you still want me, I'll watch you grow old 
 The sky is there to behold 
 You just want to be held when you're cold 
 Just grow, stretch out your soul 
 And if you still want me, I'll watch you grow old
