And I promise if you take me home, 
 I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone 
 Said come on baby, throw me a bone, 
 I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone 
 And I promise if you take me home, 
 I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone 
 Said come on baby, throw me a bone, 
 I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone 
 I'ma tell you something... about me, heheh 
 That's my favorite subject, I don't know if you picked up on that yet or not 
 I never said I had a business mind 
 I just don't believe that quitting time exists, ain't no finish line to this 
 You got to give me mine, I really shine, my given time is this 
 Live and die with the grind, driven by the fist 
 Where you do place my name if I never played your game? 
 We don't race the same, I don't run inside no painted lane 
 Plus y'all pace is strange, y'all either stop or you sprint 
 Run when it's sunny and hide if it change to rain 
 I wouldn't be half the Ali that I am 
 If I slowed myself up and tried competing with these people, fam 
 I'm every bit as unconcerned as they are unprepared 
 Market flooded, needless to say I wasn't scared 
 Let's all drop the same day, I don't fucking care 
 Put listening stations in the store and let the public hear 
 Better yet, let's have an in-store performance 
 Make it oranges to oranges, me dwarfin' your endurance 
 After that we'll shoot the shit with our supporters 
 And see how many more discs of yours the indie stores order 
 See you already know I out-rap 'em 
 On the low, we out-work, out-think, and out-class them 
 And I promise if you take me home, 
 I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone 
 Said come on baby, throw me a bone, 
 I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone 
 And I promise if you take me home, 
 I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone 
 Said come on baby, throw me a bone, 
 I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone 
 Nobody's doing this thing exactly like we do. 
 I mean they do it, they just ain't doing it exactly like us, you know what I'm saying? 
 Sucker-ass motherfucker 
 My personal pedigree's so bona fide, 
 'Cause a man of my stature ain't grown overnight 
 The undisputed king of where poor folks reside 
 Because every time I speak there'll be hope vocalized in you 
 Sit and bitch with them chickens about "it isn't fair" 
 The sound system ain't shit, but I was crystal clear 
 We first-name basis with soundmen, we bring 'em beer 
 Plus I tipped 'em fifty last semester when the clique was here 
 Listen here, I ain't going give you all the secrets 
 Just these few examples help me illustrate my pretense 
 Our strength is unrelated to your weakness 
 'Cause you'll never be a worthy pool of peers to be competed with 
 I sing my shit with Son House and Syl Johnson 
 And always lose, I done lost face too 
 But I'm sporting they shoes, so let me remind you 
 Them little kicks you're trying to fit, 
 We outgrew them shits in high school 
 And I promise if you take me home, 
 I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone 
 Said come on baby, throw me a bone, 
 I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone 
 And I promise if you take me home, 
 I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone 
 Said come on baby, throw me a bone, 
 I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone 
 I don't think I'm arrogant, man, I think just I'm, you know 
 I dos what the fuck I does, man, and it's just... 
 You can kiss my ass, all I care 
 It's of foremost importance, 
 There is none like unto the Brother Al 
 This motherfucker regardless, and stop all the nonsense 
 You see me lounging, call Rhymesayer's office, I've officially lost it 
 They say my reputation precedes me 
 I don't know the meaning of off-season, I ain't taking it easy 
 Ain't taking a day off, never had a off night 
 Never been laid off, I live on the job site 
 It all pays off, though, when I squint through the spotlight 
 And see your lips are moving to the true shit that I write 
 And we going be all right, every night of my life is my night 
 'Cause I view the future like it's hindsight 
 I ain't waiting on patiently persevering 
 I see greatness in the person in the mirror very clearly 
 And that's why I take this seriously 
 Baby, come near to me and truly, truly hear me 
 And I promise if you take me home, 
 I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone 
 Said come on baby, throw me a bone, 
 I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone 
 And I promise if you take me home, 
 I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone 
 Said come on baby, throw me a bone, 
 I'll sing you a song, never leave me alone
