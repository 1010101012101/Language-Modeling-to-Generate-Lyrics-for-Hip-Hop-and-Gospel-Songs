Shadows on the sun (multiple voices) 
 Yeah, well I guess its no where different from anywhere else in the world man 
 I look out my window I see the whole thing 
 One side of the street, is Willows funeral home 
 And the other side the library 
 Try very hard to picture this shit 
 Walks is where I live at 
 Where parents are embarrassed to tell ya where they raised their kids at 
 You need some half and half of a 8 ball, you can get that 
 Fuck with little Rodney, you get all of your ribs cracked 
 In a location where slang (crack rock) 
 Is not seen as a fucking recreation but a vocation 
 And the fellas and the smokers are both pasty 
 Get one eye on Minneapolis PT, they both racing 
 3 for 50, that's the supply and demand 
 And the twin cities, American heartland 
 And they've been busy, mastermind, tearing apart plans 
 And hoop dream is ballin with blisters on their hands 
 With chains danginling from the rims 
 Pain strangles them from within 
 Till a belt around the arm, makes the vein stand at ATTENTION! 
 I try to block it out with a bed sheet, the moon lights is the curtin 
 'Cause I'm not comforted by red and blue lights when I'm hurtin' 
 Mommy loves you, yeah I knew, but I wasn't certain 
 Cause Aneice is through, but she views life wasn't working 
 As a boy she told me 'wait for your father to come home' 
 I'm 24, still waitin for my father to come home 
 And some parents only touch their children when the whips brought 
 That's why bad kids to bad shit, just so they can get caught, and get touched 
 This growing ups shit rough 
 That's a big part of why we're so mixed up 
 Shit we don't have Bar Mitzvah's, we become men the first time our father 
 Hits us, and we don't open gifts up 
 Sister Angena, from across the street is beautiful 
 But for 50 bucks, there nothin' she wouldn't do to you 
 Used to be premium pussy, but now she's used up 
 For that same 50 bucks, she's gotta do some new stuff 
 Whatever it takes to make you pull the dollars out 
 If you don't intervene, then there's a day she'll turn her daughter out 
 Speaking of kids, I'm fixing lunch for my first born 
 I had the windows wide open cause the weathers warm 
 That's when the greatest hits of Donny Hathaway 
 Got interrupted by a driveby shooting half a block away 
 Faheim was in the window, he didn't get hit though 
 All praise to Allah 
 I see all this from the desk that I write my rhymes from 
 Pen starts to scribble on its own, my minds numb 
 But, you can call me modern urban Normal Rockwell (3x) 
 I paint a picture of the spot well 
 Outside my window (5x) 
 I can just feel that... summer breeze
