They say that lighting never strikes twice 
 In the same spot when its landed 
 You wanna see the thunder cloud I'm trapped in 
 Head down lookin' for a tactic 
 Trying to find a way up out the gravity 
 Around me I'm attached too stuck 
 Floatin' on luck like a river raft was 
 Spittin' up love like its ipecac 
 If in fact 
 There's a quicker path 
 To diminish that 
 Ima get a first class ticket 
 Just to finish last 
 Often who's watchin' 
 Chip another crooked ass tooth on my options 
 The blues never had a use for its caution 
 And cut right through me 
 Like a razor blade in march wind 
 Yeah I guess I'm livin' off a habit 
 And dig enough graves just to reseal the casket 
 Bold face march into the middle of the havoc 
 Just so I could sing a song about it all 
 Tragic 
 You act like this can save me (eh eh eh) 
 You act like I don't know (you don't know) 
 I act like I've gone crazy 
 And all of this can save me 
 But I don't really know 
 I don't know no more my brother 
 Me and my blue sensitivities 
 Look at all that this music has given me 
 Instrumentally in tune with my misery 
 I could spin bad news to a symphony 
 I ain't a boy in a bubble 
 I'm a man in touch 
 With my joy and my trouble 
 Gotta fighting chance at love in this ugliness 
 I think hope deserves to know what she's up against 
 Blues, twelves, bright twenty fours 
 Knife twice as hard 
 Fighting with the guards 
 Those chosen the moment we were born 
 Highs and lows joys and woes that are yours 
 Chase the blues and one day you gon' catch em 
 Sing 'em all you want 
 You gon' wish you never met em 
 Humming the ballad of the paper thin jacket 
 Trapped in the rain again 
 Tragic 
 You act like this can save me (eh eh eh) 
 You act like I don't know (you don't know) 
 I act like I've gone crazy 
 And all of this can save me 
 But I don't really know 
 I don't know what the deal is 
 But lately I've been looking through the thick glass 
 Squintin' just to see the smidgin' of the kick backs 
 My little ticker only flickers with a mishap 
 An lashes out at me every time that I admit that 
 Look at what I did with the ashes 
 Smokin' in the boys room 
 Ditchin' outta classes 
 Hand full of shattered stained glass 
 With a grasp tight around it 
 Just enough to make a couple wounds last as scars 
 Metals rose petals 
 Scatted on the path likes its Hansel and Gretel 
 Burn from the water I splash from the kettle 
 In efforts to make a documentation of what I went through 
 Hell 
 I guess I'm playin' from the attic 
 Pullin' up the floorboards diggin' up the hatchet 
 Firm footed standing in the middle of the static 
 Just so I could sing a song about it all 
 Tragic 
 You act like this can save me (eh eh eh) 
 You act like I don't know (you don't know) 
 I act like I've gone crazy 
 And all of this can save me 
 But I don't really know
