Get yourself together now because it's hit time 
 Your known as the hit makers 
 Breaker breakers, party makers 
 They'll make your back crack, your liver quiver 
 For all you cats, who never put more dips in your hips 
 More cut in your strut, more glide in your stride 
 If you don't dig that, you gotta hold your soul 
 If you don't dig this mess, you came to the wrong address 
 Because singing might be loud and clear 
 Ayo, the music made 'em jump back 
 Fuck that, how y'all gonna contrast somethin' fat, without lettin Ali touch that 
 Gun whack, read his lips 
 You're not serious, I got few equals and no superiors (so here he is) 
 A seasoned veteran, an ego reckon 
 I turn it up another notch to keep the people guessin' 
 Y'all ain't fuckin' with the ahk so quit your feeble session 
 Double teamin for the evening, so you heed the lessons 
 So no, here we go 
 Lookin' at me like they know me 
 Only bout as far as they drunk ass can throw me 
 Do it, somebody's bound to catch it, no breakage 
 Never that, we keep it basic like breakfast 
 So taste it, the vitamins are subtle 
 So tighten up or Slug'll, even try to decipher the puzzle 
 But shut up though (fuck that, sucka jump back) 
 I hold the game like Notre Dame, I know your dame 
 (We call her hunch back), Ali run that 
 From cats lips to gods ears 
 We align y'all punk bastards and cross hairs 
 Applying our thug tactics till y'all scared 
 Don't stop till your punk ass hits the back stairs (oh yeah) 
 Fuck that, jump back, yo, what's that 
 Drippin' off her nuts, wait, why she got a nutsack? 
 You fuckin' rappers are she-males 
 From the retail to the e-mail, defeat felt 'cause you need help 
 Y'all need to watch and observe and then follow 
 If we open for y'all it's still our show 
 I hear the same ol' shit wherever I go 
 Like Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah 
 Y'all need to watch and observe and then follow 
 If we open for y'all it's still our show 
 I hear the same ol' shit wherever I go 
 Like Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah 
 (Rappers steppin to) Ah yeah they get their shits burned 
 I throw a roll of quarters and cyphers and then I get learned 
 (Yo I don't care were you represent son, where's your chicks?) 
 We'll take her out for breakfast if you want to let your lips run 
 Listen, I know your mission 
 Some type of magician that likes to go fishin' 
 On the mic with air tight precision, the leaders keeping tradition 
 When you ain't even keeping the rhythm that the DJ is spinnin 
 Calm down little camper, I've got the answers 
 You should fuck exotic dancers 
 You should grow a pair of tits and some antlers 
 It doesn't matter, turn it up, what the fuck you think that amp's for? 
 I write poems, write rhymes, write my name in the snow 
 And I could use all of that to bend the frame of your hoe 
 And I should but instead I'll just pay the waiter and go 
 But if I didn't have a wife, yo your kids'll be albinos 
 Your respect is like a stick in the grass 
 Mean mugs and tree hugs, I'll go on about it 
 I wear my toilet paper so that y'all can kiss my ass 
 With your tongue out and write a love song about it 
 Write that shit inside of your book full of funny little scribbles 
 The love comes in vomit, the money comes in dribbles 
 The Minnesota missiles, self taught, communication 
 Mutilation, holding pictures of your sister naked 
 Ha ha, You to drunk to walk down the stairs 
 And now you standing here choking on my pubic hairs 
 Telling me your name is if you think the brother cares 
 If you keep bumping your gums, yo we can fucking take it there 
 Yo Make a room full of bump rocks stop and do twats 
 (Rest those shots from a cop, and ask him who's your pops) 
 Who's you daddy, Fuck that, jump back and act happy 
 (Sing my fucking chorus before I punch you in the face) 
 Y'all need to watch and observe and then follow 
 If we open for y'all it's still our show 
 I hear the same ol' shit wherever I go 
 Like Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah 
 Y'all need to watch and observe and then follow 
 If we open for y'all it's still our show 
 I hear the same ol' shit wherever I go 
 Like Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah
