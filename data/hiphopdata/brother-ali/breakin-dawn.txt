 Hey, hey, hey, ah 
 (Lord I just gotta find a way) 
 Old master had a leper for a child 
 Left him out to fend for hisself in the wild 
 They laughed at him anytime he went to town 
 So he kept to his self and he seldom came around 
 Loved life and he loved his kin 
 But he couldn't understand why they ain't love him 
 Slept out in the shed all alone 
 And all he ever wanted was some friends of his own 
 A few hands saved him, took him in and raised him 
 Taught him about love and struggle and patience 
 Gave him the family comfort he was cravin' 
 He worked when they work and he sang when they sang 
 He sang so clear, so loud 
 That the masters of the children could hear him from the house 
 They recognize his voice and ran out 
 Everybody wanna know what the ruckus all about y'all, child 
 Preach on Mr. Preacher Man, they say 
 Everybody wanna hear what you have to say 
 Stand tall, speak loud, boy, that's the way 
 Them songs of yours bring us a brand new day 
 Preach on Mr. Preacher Man, they say 
 Everybody wanna hear what you have to say 
 Stand tall, speak loud, boy that's the way 
 Them songs of yours bring us a brand new day 
 Ha, ha 
 (another day) 
 , ha 
 Hey, hey, hey, ah 
 (Lord I just gotta find a way) 
 See good Lord, I've been waitin so long 
 For y'all to come out here and take me in the home 
 The world's so cold with no place to belong 
 They said, "Come on in boy, sing your song." 
 He stepped inside and to his surprise 
 It was so damn fly, he can't believe his eyes 
 Ate and he drank and he felt satisfied 
 'Til he sat by the window and he glanced outside 
 Loved ones out workin' 
 Eyes got full and his heart start hurtin' 
 'Cause them folk been singin' for years 
 But ain't any one of them set foot up in here 
 Hold up, how you get so much 
 Livin' off folk like us that got it so rough 
 The way you hold 'em in your cold clutch 
 Makes me think that you don't love your own soul enough 
 Preach on Mr. Preacher Man, they say 
 Everybody wanna hear what you have to say 
 Stand tall, speak loud, boy, that's the way 
 Them songs of yours bring us a brand new day 
 Preach on Mr. Preacher Man, they say 
 Everybody wanna hear what you have to say 
 Stand tall, speak loud, boy, that's the way 
 Them songs of yours give us a brand new day 
 (Another day) 
 , ha 
 Hey, hey, hey, ah 
 (Lord I just gotta find a way) 
 Closed his eyes as he sang every note 
 The songs he was taught and the ones that he wrote 
 Stood up, cleared his throat, grabbed his coat 
 In those last moments, a few words were spoke 
 "I used to peak at this old house in awe 
 Imaginin' what it must be like and all 
 And this the finest spread these eyes ever saw 
 But I don't mind sayin I feel sorry for y'all 
 All that gettin', so little givin' 
 Led a lot of y'all to forget what's missin' 
 Built you a big pretty prison to sit in 
 Strut around here, convinced that that's livin' 
 ' 
 But we gonna keep on singin 
 Keep on solderin', keep on buildin' 
 Keep on teachin' and keep on listenin' 
 And keep, keepin' on, till the whole thing's different" 
 In the shed, the sun start to set 
 Said all his prayers and laid down his head 
 Everything said that he needed to say 
 And one of these mornings we'll wake up to a brand new 
 Preach on Mr. Preacher Man, they say 
 Everybody wanna hear what you have to say 
 Stand tall, speak loud, boy, that's the way 
 Them songs of yours give us a brand new day 
 Preach on Mr. Preacher Man, they say 
 Everybody wanna hear what you have to say 
 Stand tall, speak loud, boy, that's the way 
 Them songs of yours give us a brand new day 
 Ha, ha
