I gave you that name, boy... 
 I will never stop feelin' sorry that your home got broken 
 I feel that I owe you for the road that I chose 
 But I believe things happen the way they're supposed to 
 And you'll always be with me wherever that I go 
 I was right there for your first breath 
 I used to lay you on my chest when you slept 
 I fed you, changed you, read to you, bathed you, 
 I'm not trying to hold that over your head, 
 I'm saying thank you 
 God put you into my arms for me to teach you 
 Sometimes I gotta not be popular to reach you 
 But boy look me in my eye when I speak to you 
 I tell you these things because I believe in you 
 Respect, patience, excellence, and truth 
 Make good choices and always follow through 
 But above all else know Allah always watch us 
 And Everything we do comes back upon us 
 All right, let's talk about your mommy 
 I need you to know that I used everything inside of me 
 To make you as healthy as you could possibly be 
 And I just couldn't see a good future for us three 
 And you gonna have questions as you grow 
 But there's certain negative things that you don't need to know 
 And baby boy that's what this is about 
 We live, learn, and figure it out 
 I just pray that you don't remember us sleepin' on the floor 
 And me cleanin mouse droppings out of your toys 
 It took alot of hard work for us to get where we at 
 And young man, we ain't quittin at that 
 Just know that it hurts me to death when I leave and go tourin 
 I'm scared that it might make you feel unimportant 
 But our bond is so strong that the moment I get off 
 We seem to pick right back up where we left off 
 I try to say that I do it for you 
 But in my heart I know that's not entirely true 
 So if I ever come home and feel that I've hurt us as friends 
 I swear to God that I'll never tour again 
 I ain't never met a child quite like you 
 Words don't suffice for me to describe you 
 You have a genuine goodness inside you 
 I watch you and wonder if I was ever like you 
 It's me and you, brother, for life 
 So when you put me in the ground, look for me in the clouds 
 You make me the definition of proud 
 You taught me what this life is really about 
 Faheem...
