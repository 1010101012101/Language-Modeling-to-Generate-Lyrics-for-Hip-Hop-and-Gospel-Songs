I came in the door nineteen eighty four 
 Paint on the wall got chased by the law 
 Once got soul in the place full of flow 
 Was never given the zone had to create my own 
 As clean as the nose on my face that I placed to the stone 
 Had to stake my claim to the thrown 
 Ain't no mistaken the sacred in his tone 
 Ali the new name by which greatness is known 
 Y'all act like MCing is a new sport 
 Your too inexperienced your teeth are too short 
 Every culture has a right to passage 
 You wanna bypass it and sell me your practice 
 One for the lunch money 
 I don't run from you punch-drunk dummies 
 I invite you all to come for me 
 I set up shop hungry when it wasn't sunny 
 I been here long after y'all are done humpin' 
 Talk to me when you've done somthing 
 Other than swingin' back 'n' forth from hating to nut huggin 
 No, all criticism isn't constructive 
 Some need to be destructed, your done with 
 And either you retire to the sideline 
 Or imbrace this time, this rhyme with your eyes wide open 
 Shit won't have to earn them accolades 
 A-N-T gonna take you all back to phase one 
 Yes Yes y'all you don't stop 
 Now come alive A-N-T and give me what you got 
 Brother Ali rock shock the house we most definitely 
 We bout to turn your doubt y'all 
 A yes yes y'all and you don't dare stop 
 Well come alive A-N-T and give me what you got 
 Brother Ali rock shocking the house we most definitely 
 (Scratching:) (the way I feel now I just got to rock) 
 Y'all ain't heard nothing I gave you your first lesson 
 From what you discussin' over the percussion you 
 Never compare to me 
 You a parent tearin, repeating what you hear fly through the airwaves 
 Carelessly 
 The meaning get lost in translation 
 You a copy of the authors first page 
 Counterfeit money, only get it in small denomination 
 You'll never be prominent - face it your imitation 
 Equal sacrament, sea bass generic ass 
 Sprayin' through closed concerts simulacrum 
 We used to distribute our music ourselves 
 Our records shouldn't even be held on the same shelve 
 Its bad enough they put y'all with 'rock the bells' 
 Cliche the culture we're best to be involved in it 
 Y'all will sqaunder in it 
 No need to think for a minute by pushing limits 
 You can see a pond to fish in 
 And you will get strangled by your lines 
 Whether your anglin or sayin' ryhmes in due time 
 Send your dues back to shoe shines and clipin coupons 
 Fuck you and fuck the lighter you open your brew on 
 You slither out from under a rock 
 And then present yourself for something you not 
 The Brother you jock 
 Try true hip hop Preston forgot 
 Swing it on the first fight and mother fucker I spot 
 What the fuck not? 
 I would love nothing more than to bust your box 
 And blood clot a porn spot 
 Three things I got I love'em alot 
 Do anything to protect them from the vultures of block 
 Hover above on the block, you mother fuckers better not 
 Yes Yes y'all you don't dare stop 
 Now come alive A-N-T and give me what you got! 
 Brother Ali rock shock the house most definitely 
 We gonna turn your doubt y'all 
 Yes yes y'all you don't dare stop 
 Well come alive A-N-T and give me what you got! 
 Brother Ali rock shock the house most definitely 
 We bout to turn you out y'all 
 The champion is back with his man again 
 Crack the book open and fill another chapter in 
 And we just wont stop come alive rhymesayer give me what you got Ah!
