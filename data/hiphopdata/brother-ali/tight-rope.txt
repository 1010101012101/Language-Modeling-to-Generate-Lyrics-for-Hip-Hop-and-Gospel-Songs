Frigid frozen Minnesota 
 Chip on his shoulder 
 Sick sleeping on a pissy sofa 
 Unwanted visitor in a different culture 
 Missing home and he cant go their civil warin' 
 Listen solider forget getting over 
 Prison state around the corner homeless is even closer 
 Kids with similar skin color still don't even want ya 
 Spit and insult ya 'cause they have been here longer 
 He leave his crib he guaranteed the pigs approach ya 
 Where ya going where ya from any weapons on ya? 
 Your family is stressed out your getting older 
 You don't live the way they did back in Somalia 
 It's extra difficult to be a daughter 
 Trying to keep it modest with the sinners all around you 
 Wear the wrong garment your parents get an ulcer 
 If you wrap it up the other children picking on you 
 Live in two worlds with your eyes closed 
 Tip-toeing on a tight rope 
 Holding on for survival 
 Nobody to blame this is just how it goes 
 Live in two worlds with your eyes closed 
 Tip-toeing on a tight rope 
 Holding on for survival 
 Nobody to blame this is just how it goes 
 Holidays and you know what the business is 
 You get two birthdays and two Christmases 
 Older you get you resent how sick it is 
 They're trying to cover their guilt with the gifts they give 
 Bounce from his house to her house 
 Too bad that marriage didn't work out 
 Now you don't have a your house 
 Daddy fighting mommy they both tell me they love me 
 If I get to close to one the other one start acting funny 
 Ma went and had a baby with a different dad 
 You act happy to please 'em but you really sad 
 Seeing first hand that family that you will never have 
 Plus you ain't no real brother, you're just a half 
 Got to pick up the pieces and move on 
 Bedtime stories and greet them on the phone 
 Live in two houses and neither one is home 
 Wishing you were grown have the freedom to get gone 
 Live in two worlds with your eyes closed 
 Tip-toeing on a tight rope 
 Holding on for survival 
 Nobody to blame this is just how it goes 
 Live in two worlds with your eyes closed 
 Tip-toeing on a tight rope 
 Holding on for survival 
 Nobody to blame this is just how it goes 
 Daddy was a preacher 
 Mama was a Sunday school teacher 
 Big brother a football squad leader 
 Now far be it for you to disappoint or displease them 
 You're just being what you feel you see in 
 That mirror every time you peer in 
 Swallow the tears inside that empty feeling 
 Her boy terrified to let the world in 
 He has girlfriends but doesn't want a girlfriend 
 He retreats inside himself 
 Where he lives life itself in secret 
 Daddy says people go to hell for being 
 What he is and he certainly believes 'em 
 Cause there ain't no flame that can blaze enough 
 To trump being hated for the way you love 
 And cry yourself to sleep and hate waking up 
 Its a cold world y'all, shame on us 
 Live in two worlds with your eyes closed 
 Tip-toeing on a tight rope 
 Holding on for survival 
 Nobody to blame this is just how it goes 
 Live in two worlds with your eyes closed 
 Tip-toeing on a tight rope 
 Holding on for survival 
 Nobody to blame this is just how it goes
