(Somebody told me, that the obtuse... don't worry about it. Get down with me and we'll set you free.) 
 (Hit it) 
 Yeah, yeah, y'all need to swing like that right there 
 (I want everybody to jump out their seats! And start clappin' your hands!) 
 (Ali) 
 Rhymesayer entertain 
 Try to name a better chain 
 Reveal your jealous aim 
 Some things will never change 
 Best twain your family together man 
 Them people cellophane 
 They lie on their mother's name 
 I'm invincible 
 Walk with my word 
 And my balls and my principles 
 Like a true prince should do 
 Only givin' you 
 A little bitty glimpse of truth 
 As I'm livin' through 
 Imagine what I'm fittin' to do 
 I ain't that hit it and quit it 
 Dude livin' for that minute 
 Then spittin' I'm hittin' 
 Get residual 
 Peddle hard and settle not 
 For even a notch 
 Beneath the premium spot 
 Cream of the crop 
 Believe it or not 
 I'm over every night 
 Like one life changin' 
 Moment at a time 
 Please trust you'll find 
 No better design 
 I'm so justified 
 I'm boasts of every kind 
 Nose to the grind 
 No wait, no never mind 
 I can tell you turn blue in the face 
 The end of time 
 Viewers have a go on 
 Bare witness to the job 
 And your ass would probably 
 Went and did it by now 
 So now, come now 
 Walk with me 
 I think and I walk 
 And I talk awkwardly 
 Ifin' you gotta see 
 In order to believe 
 Then your ass must be blind 
 None strong as me, Ali 
 Come down 
 Walk with me 
 I think and I walk 
 And I talk honestly 
 I show strangers 
 What the ought not to see 
 But that's just our nature 
 None strong as we 
 (Slug) 
 Call me Slug 
 That's it don't need no acronyms 
 Tryna keep the masochist 
 Tucked inside the pacifist 
 But god it's gettin' hard to give 'em passes 
 When they act as if the came upon 
 The south side of Nazarreth 
 Can't imagine this, like a beauty pagent 
 Where them models protect and serve 
 The law of averageness 
 Coat hanger on the mic 
 Rappin' manikins 
 Stash 'em out behind the garage 
 Where the trash be in 
 Don't go and get mad 
 I ain't your daddy kid 
 And you not Ant 
 So why you tryna sample this? 
 Puff your little titties out 
 Ego expandin' them shenanigans 
 Will catch a free ride 
 Up in that ambulance 
 Can't fix some damages with bandages 
 Another mid-life crisis 
 Tryna brag on all the ass you get 
 Cash it in and take a look at who you're dancin' with 
 You're just a middleman 
 Between the fans and your management 
 Minneapolis, taste the passion 
 With a twist of lemon 
 'Cause I'm on some old fashioned shit 
 So tell Anakin 
 We're lookin' for where Lando is 
 Coachin' the champion 
 Go fix a couple sandwiches 
 (Ali) 
 Yeah, come now 
 Walk with me 
 I think and I walk 
 And I talk awkwardly 
 Ifin' you gotta see 
 In order to believe 
 Then your ass must be blind 
 None strong as me, Ali 
 Come down 
 Walk with me 
 I think and I walk 
 And I talk honestly 
 I show strangers 
 What the ought not to see 
 But that's just my nature 
 None strong as we 
 Used to raise babies 
 In a funky old dirty place 
 So I kept me 
 A snub nosed .38 
 Took it to a pawn shop 
 On a friction paid 
 Ran with it 
 Didn't wanna send 'em 
 To the pearly gates 
 In the gut hear the beat drop 
 See me hop up off the sheet rock 
 And strut like a peacock 
 Get your teeth knocked 
 Clean out your speech box 
 Must not believe that meat's 
 The greased part 
 I wrote god a love letter with street chalk 
 Fell through potato chips 
 ____________________ 
 And there I stood 
 In all of my splendor 
 Till I did believe I told 'em 
 Everything that I meant 
 So come down, come now 
 Walk with me 
 I think and I walk 
 And I talk awkwardly 
 Ifin' you gotta see 
 In order to believe 
 Then your ass must be blind 
 None strong as me, Ali 
 Come down 
 Walk with me 
 I think and I walk 
 And I talk honestly 
 I show strangers 
 What the ought not to see 
 But that's just our nature 
 None strong as we 
 (But the squares won't dance 
 'Cause they just all fakes 
 And they can't understand 
 The commands of the breaks)
