Are you here to confuse me? (x5) 
 Woman, I gave you the grand tour 
 There's no reason for you to look closer 
 But you do so I show you 
 It ain't pretty here now but it will be 
 One day I promise, when the sun rays are honest 
 I chip away at the tint on the windows 
 Stain in the glass, it's a pain in the ass 
 I scrape and I scratch till my arms grow weary 
 Meanwhile I warned you not to stand near me 
 I think I built the fence a little late 
 The demons were already in, now they can't escape 
 I've been toe to toe with most of em' though 
 As a whole they must perish in order for me to grow 
 Huddled in the gloomy little cracks that they inhabit 
 They pass away the day I deactivate my habits 
 Each one gets buried in the backyard 
 In tiny little graves marked only by a black scar 
 Kindly watch your step 
 This silence isn't finished being awkward yet 
 Trophies lay in the basement to stay safe 
 Today's mistakes are in a lighted trophy case though 
 And I want you to know 
 I only invited you 'cause I ain't thought you would show 
 But I'll be damned if you ain't grab my hand 
 And presented yourself from the threshold of the heartland 
 Are you here to confuse me (x2) 
 I don't mean to confuse you (x2) 
 You'll notice antique swords adorn the walls 
 They're really not here for decoration at all 
 I save them shits from old relationships 
 And I swing 'em at you later if you stay in the mix 
 Don't you realize nobody's really been inside here 
 Since it was last drenched in dry tears 
 Decorating was a senseless idea 
 'Cause only the blind lonely prince resides here 
 We dine here on a balanced diet 
 Ego when it's loud, self-hatred when it's quiet 
 Inside the castle this is what the life is 
 Sign here after you read the fine print 
 It's not much, but all of it's yours 
 Take great caution if you want to explore 
 Watch your head when you opening the doors 
 And always remember that the choice was yours 
 And I want you to know 
 I only invited you 'cause I ain't thought you would show 
 But I'll be damned if you ain't grab my hand 
 And presented yourself from the threshold of the heartland 
 Are you here to confuse me (x4) 
 Are you... are you... breathing?
