C'mon, ma, can I borrow the keys? 
 My generation is car-pooling with doom and disease 
 Buckle up, skipper--the New American Asterix 
 You're riding shotty with Jesus of Nascar-eth 
 At the end of the day, we all sittin' on twenty-fours 
 Three hundred and sixty five horses, no horse shit 
 With nothing but a learning permit 
 Delinquents on the autobahn poppin' our airbags off, worthless 
 I'm not depressed, man, I'm just a fucking New Yorker 
 Who knows that sittin' in traffic with these bastards is torture 
 I'll be in a jalopy with a mami getting head rest 
 And howl at the glowing moon roof as proof that I'm not dead yet 
 And y'all can all give me a hummer (suck it) 
 'Cause in the meantime, I'ma pimp this ride like fly formula one-er 
 This is the El-Product summer 
 With a gleam of factory gun metal sheen grey and no vin number 
 Drive, Drive, Drive 
 Hopped in the hooptie screaming "freedom is mine!" 
 Drive, Drive, Drive, Drive 
 Bumpin' the tune I so conveniently provide 
 Drive, Drive, Drive, Drive, Drive 
 Don't have to be flashy, I'll use any old ride 
 Drive, Drive, Drive, Drive 
 Hop in the whip and peel away, stay alive 
 Cars drive by with the booming system 
 Like New York is Fallujah with metal gear using Christians 
 Posted up for the gods of oil mining 
 In a military humvee with no bullet proof siding (sorry, guys) 
 Brooklyn, baby, I'm waterlocked walkin' nervous 
 When the curfew was imposed closing transportational service 
 This gonzo-matic fear turns me Hunter S. Thompson 
 With my lawyer leaning over the side view mirror vomiting 
 You call 'em windows, I call 'em asbestos lesseners 
 For this wheezing in my chest I'll need more than fucking air fresheners 
 There ain't no easy pass, hands on the dash 
 You'll get rocked in casbah if you're moving too fast 
 Here come the cannon balls, run--get in your gremlin 
 The days of thunder's creepin' up sooner than you expected 
 Paranoid brethren disable their OnStar knowing they'll trace us 
 Pull us over and shout "get out le car!" 
 These TV thugs got the heart of Herbie the Luv Bug 
 It don't take a speed racing mind to see that they're just thugs 
 I'll wrap your promo truck with a NAMBLA stencil 
 To prove that you're fucking babies, frontin' up in a rental 
 I knew a kid who navigated a slippery 
 And fuel injected a speed ball on hs way to Atlantic City 
 Out the race before even making his mark 
 And now he'll never pick his shit up out of long term parking 
 My triple A card has one too many initials 
 And autobot on the fringe of liquid addiction spinning fish-tails 
 About to careen on some Toonces shit off the cliff (Toonces, no!) 
 But love of the sport of racing is keeping me out of coffins 
 Camu was like "Fuck it, just keep the beats dirty dusty" 
 I grabbed the CB radio like "ten-four, good buddy" 
 I'll keep running the track, even when muddy 
 'Cause my insurance don't cover leaving behind the pit crew that love me 
 So I drive
