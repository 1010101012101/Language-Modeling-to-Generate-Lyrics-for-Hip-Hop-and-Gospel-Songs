When a live wire lights little metal rail right 
 When a marvel of engineering steered me clear into the plight 
 Right before the bodegas open, after the peak of night 
 Before the paper's delivered, I sat on the corner and sparked a light 
 The same corner I perched when I zone-dropped on the block first 
 At almost 5:00 o'clock, watching for sunspots or store clerks 
 Alone spot, almost kinda like the zone was forgot 
 As if the grid had been reset and couldn't catch to the clock 
 Or the stoop was stuck in the past a half minute and I sat in it 
 With a loosie Newpy drift out of my lips, taste: half minted 
 Come on 
 And I felt like a hundred bucks in the pocket of a gambling lush 
 At a Wonder Showzen flow with the droids of destructo luck 
 Fugitoid on the run again, the sky gleamed the maroonist coloring 
 Layered against the bluest tone from where the thunder lived 
 And there I was directly under it 
 Like some dejected little grey they told to stay and wait for the mothership 
 A cotton ball in a blizzard of mischief or brain prison 
 With a thought that rode on the bus and came for conjugal visits 
 And fucked its way into my grey matter the tattered territory 
 Stayed chattering and nagging till it demanded it yell it for me 
 And I tried to hold the thing back but the meditation was otherly 
 Fixated on what a friend said and relating it to my struggling 
 "Metropoloid void so damn smothering" 
 But we were children of Poisenville and saw the seduction less repugnant 
 And reserved the right as the triggerman with the back up plan of self-destruction 
 And I touched the type of chemicals that could pull me towards that function 
 It's the stuff I find hard for discussion 
 How the fuck do you explain your own self-destruction and still remain trusted? 
 Come on 
 To answer the question, yes- the city wants you gone 
 And that's the only thing connecting us, but the connection is so strong 
 So how dare you assume that I'll sleep when you're dead 
 This is well outside the boundaries of acceptable behavior 
 I will not give you the go ahead and you will not be remembered fondly 
 I'm throwing down the gauntlet, fuck you this isnt your decision 
 And for all the holy fuck I give your little spectacle is ended 
 But don't think for just one second you've honored your obligations to me 
 I'm serious look in my eyes, I don't find this funny 
 Or whatever you imagine poetry and justice feels like when you combine them 
 I am not going to allow this on my watch buddy, nobodies impressed 
 With your imagined sacrifice device or insurmountable regret 
 You are not uniquely pained and if you go we won't be sorry 
 And who the hell are you to me through the banality of watching this 
 'Cause many better men have gone for clearly better reasons 
 And I starkly must remind you that you have not even been trying 
 And thats the only thing remarkable about you, stop me if I'm lying 
 We are always outnumbered but we were never out militia'ed 
 There's no dignity for criminals, no ministry for the wicked 
 In this town if you make a sound you're the leper with the most fingers 
 The league of extraordinary nobodies the other teams bringing in ringers 
 No faith in the majority, no hope for the little ones 
 Sally pulled a pistol out, Billy got a blunderbuss 
 So what the fuck are you feeling that makes your struggle so wonderous? 
 Enough to arrogantly pull what's left of the rug out from under us? 
 I think not, you're in the same barrel all us other crabs are caught 
 And if I have to live, you have to live 
 Whether you like this shit or not 
 Come on 
 Dedicated to the drowning 
 And the noble futility of the desperate friends forced to watch 
 And to my good friends who refused to allow it to happen to me 
 You know who you are, you know what I'm talking about 
 Believe me, man, I promise 
 I'm never ever ever gonna get that way again 
 Never never ever gonna get that way again 
 Never never ever gonna get that way again 
 Never never ever gonna get that way again 
 Never never ever gonna get that way again 
 Never never ever gonna get that way again 
 Never never never gonna get that way again 
 Never never ever gonna get that way again
