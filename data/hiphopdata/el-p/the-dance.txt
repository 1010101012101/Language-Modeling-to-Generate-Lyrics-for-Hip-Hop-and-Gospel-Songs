You didn't think me and El was comin' like this 
 Def Jux Motherfucker and we run this shit 
 Got you all up on your keyboard stunnin and shit 
 Oh you got a couple jokes now you funny bitch (HA HA) 
 Have you laughin' all the way to the bank 
 On point make a cut like we holdin' a shank 
 Got it all up on ya back now you walkin' a plank 
 Try to do it like this but you drawin a blank 
 Do it double time all up in yo face 
 Like piranhas when you drop fresh meat in the tank 
 Fell off of the game can't keep ya rank 
 Mad cause you try to rock sweet but you ain't 
 Been around no-will shit where crews peel clips 
 Niggaz that kill for fun 
 Wanna talk that ill shit sayin' how you kill shit 
 Bullets still in ya gun 
 Koolaid in ya veins so now you gotta change clothes 
 'Cause you pissed ya pants 
 Saw me durango said you wanna tango 
 Now this is the dance 
 Where ya shoes at where ya crew at 
 Claim you do gats but you do rap 
 What you gonna bust a verse right before the guns burst 
 Push ya girl on the ground so that you can run first 
 Now you about to get rolled up hold up wait 
 Just an emcee that was tryin' to make cake 
 Now you gotta gun all up in ya face 
 All of a sudden found god like run and mase 
 Thought it be fun to front on tape 
 Now you wish you woulda have stuck to drum 'n' bass 
 But you had to be hard on the boulevard 
 When you never gang banged a day in ya town 
 Try to be a manhuter the streets ain't a jungle gym nigga stop playin' 
 Around 
 Lay it down 
 (Chorus: repeat 3X) 
 This is the Dance! 
 You don't wanna be late 'cause the moment won't wait betta get ya shit straight 
 This is ya Chance! 
 You don't have to be fake with a heart full of hate just try to say thanks 
 Murs fall up on the spot like what up bitch 
 Approached the finest girl like shut up bitch 
 Than I grab the microphone and I cut up kids 
 Like a hot knife straight through a butter stick 
 Now I'm in the spotlight about to rock all night 
 Shot of tequila than a hot mamacita 
 Who said she know to swallow but not margaritas 
 Body on point so I follow the leader 
 Need more tequila so I swallow the liter 
 How can the night get sweeter (can't) 
 So I passed out woke up do it again 
 Won't neva roll up ya crew in the wind 
 High velocity high viscocity slippin right pass your animosity 
 Fans are constantly, askin me 
 Who said what and who has beef 
 My crew got stuck in we to musty 
 So try to weigh it out with the truth laid out (stop the gossip) 
 That's just played out there's more to ya life than underground rap 
 What you waste all ya time and you wanna run it back 
 All on the message board runnin' ya yap 
 At the end of the night only wanted to chat 
 Now you know that you got issues 
 That early in the morn you should look at some porn 
 And jack off right in the tissue 
 Than call it a night that's probley the life 
 Go to sleep with the girl that you callin ya wife 
 Wake up to the same shit different day 
 Everybody onto work and they on the way 
 'Cause we all got bills and rent to pay 
 Lent to the earth wasn't meant to stay 
 So before I'm gone I wanna make a hit song that'll always get some play 
 Got the homey el producto workin in the cut so what you got to say 
 (El-P) 
 You wanna trace along the pattern of fair please rest 
 I wanna pattern how the drum scheme mechanism I.D. jux breath commence fresh 
 Test the mesh, metal on the chestplate tech 
 Better wear the smile right, wanna frown like die right 
 With a highlight primal fright in a prime life of a double ox razor blade fade like 88' 
 It's the revenge on the whits and lazerface oh break two three 
 God to analog monkey not me rock hard and shit 
 The radio flyer kit, flyin with a boombox pack wit' clips 
 Faggots wanna ratta tat tatter this 
 And a PT cruiser he creed lucifer 
 Here comes the booster bruiser, betta get used to losin movement 
 They couldn't move like el, ox, murs, lif or bazooka tooth die so useless 
 So use this tip that'll have a little truth in it like (poof) 
 Deep space nine milli mechanism fist raise the roof again 
 Who stays on a move that says 
 Jukie with a shake ring catapult crawl through the trenches 
 Revelation manifacture eat senses all city 
 All compositive battle turn logic pretty 
 All the hard edge tomorrow brings heads or home up in me come get me 
 I'm for this shitty dizzy spinning lawless constant progress whose with me 
 Fabolous thunder bird word nerd unda that tom pill shit 
 Who heard kill quick 
 And independent since 96' they still ride ya dick 
 I refined the style with wild wit from an era with an automan mix 
 Community watch groups enlist young kids 
 Hit the road skippy 
 I don't answer to you george bush or the war time committee 
 Dumber than a mongaloid race movin shit 
 With a heart of hell's tutelage bruisin shit 
 Every time you make a move the industry start the new movement kid 
 I'm not losin bitch 
 Essentially on the edge of a generations new ruthlesness 
 Who's in charge, take me to ya leader man stop the foolishness 
 Cop the new shit bitch
