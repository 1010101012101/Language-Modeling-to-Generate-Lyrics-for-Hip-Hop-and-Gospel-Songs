(Feat. Stephanie Vezina) 
 Twilight is coming 
 Soon now the night will start to fall 
 Who will remember me 
 When there'll be nothing here at all 
 I peer through the darkness 
 Straight up from where the heavens call 
 Hanging above me 
 Clearly the meaning of it all 
 Of it all 
 Heavenly bodies 
 Glowing breathlessly for me 
 Carry me with you 
 Take me where I long to be 
 Take me there where I'll be free 
 Starlight is blinding 
 Echoing through eternity 
 Flooding my body 
 A grisly symphony
