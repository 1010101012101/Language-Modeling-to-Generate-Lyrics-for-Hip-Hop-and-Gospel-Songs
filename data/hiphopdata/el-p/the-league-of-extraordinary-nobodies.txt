The League Of Extraordinary Nobodies was filmed in front of a live studio audience 
 I just counted in my head how many people in this room 
 I'm talking to that I would never give the time 
 Here we are all being vain and looking at ourselves in mirrors 
 Very closely nodding straight up in a line 
 All the funny little stories that are told 
 Are being fueled by what amounts to nothing more than minor crime 
 But I'm a whore and I'm exploring territory 
 Where the party and the pussy both are numbered with a dime 
 I've been thinkin' that this frozen glow I've chosen 
 Is a candidate to lead me to a very sudden end 
 Another room up in the tombs, an ugly substance 
 Where the grave diggers are shoveling that dirt up in her heads 
 The very fact is that I'm sitting here with zombies talking endlessly 
 But couldn't tell you one thing that was said 
 I get surrounded by the friendliest of strangers 
 Who would sooner kill themselves, than give a fuck if I were dead 
 I just realized the tragedy of this is that her hand is on my leg 
 And she so clearly wants to fuck 
 (oh fuck) 
 I know I'm wide, and I would certainly oblige 
 I can't continue getting high and then confusing it for lust 
 I'm not an angel, but the baggie we unfolded 
 And just split to give a lick is dripping at me colored rust 
 And you seem nice, but I still hate you for the moment 
 'Cause I'm too smart to be open, this is artificial trust 
 I've been noticing the fact that nothing glorious can happen anymore 
 We've run the gambit of our filth 
 But here I am again, pretending spontaneity exists 
 With idiots all lifted out there on no gills 
 Aren't you disturbed that everything you did tonight 
 Is something else you did already and its meaning is still nil 
 And all the people in your presence are just weapons 
 It's just simple as the theory that the dying love to kill 
 Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody 
 Everybody here is so alive 
 Oh, what a night 
 Oh, what a night 
 Oh, what a night 
 You would tell me if I was crazy, right? 
 I've been wondering how arrogant it is for me 
 To keep doing the things that killed so many that we know. (No, No, No) 
 I've been noticing how quickly motherfuckers have the answers to existence 
 Just as soon as someone goes. (Go, go, go) 
 We change the channel for a week or so of cleansing and reflecting on ourselves 
 But then it's back to that old show (It's a show) 
 I hear the cackles of the crowd, they're laughing at us 
 And we haven't even gotten to the part where it's a joke
