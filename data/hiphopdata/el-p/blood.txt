(Don't look now, you're becoming... your parents.) 
 I plug the ladies in 
 Mom kept the babies in 
 Do right Do right Do right Do right Do right {*3X*} 
 I plug the ladies in 
 Mom kept the babies in 
 Do right Do right Do right Do right Do right {*7X*} 
 I saw a dream flow slow 
 Through the soluble hemoglobin 
 With jackles from every trade 
 With boogie faces from motors 
 She's walking beneath the rain 
 Connected by flesh extensions 
 While I've been through every puddle 
 My little walkers connected and... 
 I shout grate the biscuits 
 Grip the slip and repeat it 
 Baby boys in the puddle 
 And mothers sent us to pen again 
 This is the big fear 
 And I'm reaching up from the swamp in here 
 I'm taking away the trust 
 While the screaming can turn the a saint (?) 
 She wrote 
 Throw us out in a week 
 With a flash little man huddle 
 And infinite maternal wear 
 We used to sleep on cardboard 
 I stutter with chopped image 
 Of rapping while she listens to playing 
 I heard of trouble funk 
 Wake me with a sentence 
 I saw your dream flow slow 
 Through the soluble hemoglobin 
 With Teddy Ruxpin cut daggers 
 And tusslin' with monster motors 
 You wouldn't stop water choking 
 He has that vein of magic 
 And I slip below the city far below the big erratic 
 I plug the ladies in 
 Mom kept the babies in 
 Do right... {*3X*} 
 I plug the ladies in 
 Mom kept the babies in 
 Do right Do right... {*3X*} 
 When I say he I mean I 
 (Can prevail) 
 When I say you I mean we 
 (Will prevail) 
 When I say she I mean God 
 (Give us strength) 
 Do right do right do right do right do right... {*5X*} 
 I saw your dream flow slow 
 Through the soluble hemoglobin 
 Where emotions cause no emotions 
 A battle scar opens on 
 Mob smile 
 Dat style 
 The dance maneuvers of a little child 
 Look to the side lines where I shine upon my time 
 The physic declines through sharp finds and blood lines 
 Upon the heath the dew remains cold 
 Though the sun shines 
 The other: speak not of it 
 The moon will drag the oceans tide and then my heart will split 
 Back hunch 
 Eyes well 
 Thoughts mutilate a slide show 
 The darkest thoughts were used in a row 
 Where did the child go? 
 A kiss is floating throught the air but never landed 
 Will you accept all these excuses in exchange for understanding? 
 We saw a dream flow slow 
 Through the soluble hemoglobin 
 Where our love resembles clothing 
 And the beats are human clothing 
 And the thoughts of focus of consistence 
 Supersidal magic 
 I slip beyond myself into the realms of bad magic 
 I plug the ladies in 
 Mom kept the babies in 
 Do Right... {*fades out*}
