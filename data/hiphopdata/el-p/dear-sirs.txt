Dear Sirs: 
 If the pavement comes alive on Flatbush Ave. with toothy smile 
 Comprised of traffic cones and manholes become eyes 
 And birds burst into flames while singing Satan's praises 
 And fold into the sky and rain down ashy danger 
 If every office empties and all slaves walk in dazes 
 To a pool of liquid money where they bathe blissfully naked 
 And drugs no longer taunt me and flooze around my conscience 
 And every woman-beating rapist is securely in their coffins 
 And every open hydrant in a Brooklyn time summer moment 
 Is opened up by cops and folds out into an ocean 
 And rent is paid by bread literally and parking isn't paid for 
 And food stamps can be planted and childhoods can't be damaged 
 If fire can power spaceships that safely ship the creators 
 Of dynamite and gunpowder to the graves of all who faced it 
 And the slurping nerf of bureaucrat life and bean-counting slave owners 
 Is twisted in on itself until they shave off their own faces 
 And the coke and crack in the nation is collected in a top hat 
 And force-fed to the children of every CIA agent 
 And the dustheads get an angel and an acre's worth of rainbow 
 And the projects turn to clouds and the stupid aren't so proud 
 And the sniveling grimace mongrels of infected money 
 Slobbing pesticrats ignite into a brilliant beam of light 
 And mercy is the rule and the exception's mercy too 
 And the desert comes to Brooklyn and the president goes to school 
 Time flows in reverse, death becomes my birth 
 Me fighting in your war is still, by a large margin 
 The least likely thing that will ever fucking happen 
 Ever
