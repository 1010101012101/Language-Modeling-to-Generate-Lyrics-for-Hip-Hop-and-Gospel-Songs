 Cheddar cane, leather interior range 
 Inferior Timothy Leary estranged 
 Theories are nearly insane, bleary 
 ? Surely by years of the same gears 
 It's weird to the same ears whose careers 
 Is to aim spears at the gears in the chain 
 And weird to the ears of the lame squares 
 Of the gear and chain set 
 Bruising their ? losers approvingly 
 Maim truthers to losers of games blibbity blibbity blop 
 Hideous all bark, no bite 
 Mama said "don't fight" 
 Papa said "yeah, right" 
 Sister in the dark with a flashlight 
 I'm walking through the park in the lamp light 
 Shark and the lamb with the land mines

 The mouth is the eyes of the soul 
 The soul is the ass of the brain 
 The brain is the back of the train 
 Back of the bus, acting and such 
 ?, Discuss 
 Act with us, or 
 Pack it up, or 
 Slice the price that's twice as nice and jack it up 
 Who gives a fuck what I'm talking bout? Walk it out 
 Knock 'em out the spot, let me talk it out 
 Do the wok, baseball bat, all that 
 Fall back, give a fuck about what you wanna call that 
 New school Terror Squad 
 Terror gone, terror god 
 Little white bumps on gold keys 
 People act like they know me

 And Planned Parenthood at home which is my other land 
 Confuse 
 Wish I had a hovercraft to crash, I'd love that man 
 My brother man said I could cop one for a hundred grand 
 A hundred grand is all I need 
 A hundred is enough for me 
 Enough for me to twist some weed 
 Make some funnies with my G's 
 Some more money with my G's 
 Half a million in rupees

 Addicted like ? to ? do something to me 
 Yo, my man 
 You ain't funny, you Robin Williams, you got me all mad 
 If you doubt I spit fire you probably a drag 
 Mrs. Doubtfire, you probably all sad 
 Probably wack like Affleck in Hollywoodland 
 I probably would man 
 On American Bandstand 
 If I was from back then and not a tan man 
 It's Himanshu, who could it be 
 In that red Budweiser hat, who but me? 
 White dad swag, my seeds change the world 
 Don't have kids, you're not that ill 
 Too much greed in the world 
 You can see hilarity ensue

 The street meat feed youth 
 The boogie men bend rules 
 Elite scene double breast monocle men move

 I'm fine, and you? 
 Fine like sinew 
 In arm outstretched 
 Inject in you

 Cargo bay loads, the drones just hit Mach 2 
 Burner hatch opens, the drone stops drops two 
 The kumbaya bitches who flash us flash you 
 Fuck us? Fuck that 
 Burn air, vaccuum

 Yeah I stay guerilla ? to the block, true 
 Come on it's the way of things, relax act cool 
 No hablan Ingl√©s, ? great disgrace 
 ? Trace 
 No option to talk it out, no route labeled 'escape' 
 ? Fuzzy friend crunchy plus cutter with hate 
 El-product plucking the little wings off your fly shit 
 Hands under the magnifier fry quick 
 Pinning back eyelids 
 Gaze upon the god that has subjected us
