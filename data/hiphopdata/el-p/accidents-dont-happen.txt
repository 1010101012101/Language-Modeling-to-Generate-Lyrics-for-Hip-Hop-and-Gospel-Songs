(El-P) (official) 
 Yo, I touch with rusted clutch, then spun out of the dust 
 And careen into the temples of automated destruct 
 Nanotech bugs in the blood get unplugged 
 Fishing for the fly shit hybrid 
 I run among the mudskipper swarms through warnings and good morning Beiruits 
 Little Billy Blunderbuss looking for more recruits 
 City life is practice casket truancy 
 That's the rule of you and me, brash unmasked lunacy 
 Friends used to laugh fast, grasped little truth from me 
 Now they check their bags with a staff claspin' Uzis 
 Who deserves the wrath without warning 
 The same sky for the martyr with a spork scorch New York forfeits 
 Run among the poppy fields order some more clips 
 Store trips are weird but the fear is forceless 
 Bloomey bought the city of Lego and shitty metal hull 
 Jitters to the floor boards burnt almost aborted 
 Flight of the accidental tourist, morbid 
 The advertising gods so oddly courtship 
 Godly corporate squads plot these tortures 
 Holiness is hard and it's costing god fortunes 
 (Guess he took a second job on the force to afford it) 
 I don't want a part of these self fulfilled prophecies 
 Man it's too much for my stubbornness, I hate the people runnin' shit 
 Now if you sleep at ground o below, wishing you peaceful sleep 
 Where horror on the surface emerges less frequently, 
 Metal bars of ancient Rome dissolved from the scenery (now what the fuck) 
 I'll take a hostage and walk through the mosh pit 
 Pristine untouched, NB703's untouched 
 Trust is a commodity crushed by Pol Pottery 
 Your cookie cutter laws contain flaws in philosophy 
 Tumbling down a flight of Escher bach steps delight 
 Cause the man who raped my sister wont sleep right tonight 
 Now I suppose the pretty horses in fours could love more 
 But I'm exhausted by the scope of this dark god on opiates 
 Breakfast for dystopian ruthless hope movements 
 Seasonal and festive the butchery's lookin' good 
 And now writers block is a prison camp where free press regress 
 Now you can hypnotize the herd 
 I'm alive with fly visions that attack like Alfred Hitchcock raising rabid carrier pigeons 
 True the only form of com not tapped is trapped strong 
 In the cranium of future rebel infants whistling the song 
 I know you're listening, get down with this bitch, whistle along. 
 (Cage) 
 It's like the Bilderburgs came to dinner with filthy birds 
 They pussy all infected I'm lookin' for milky words 
 They pulled my third eye out then they let it dry out 
 Had to pour my belief in Chrst to find out 
 What I look like with no skin 
 Who mandated while the back of my paper is still luminated 
 Even your no flipped egyptian Euro 
 Got my website shut down by the Bureau 
 Can't kick it with the dead until my life stop 
 But Bush got a ouija to talk to Adam Weishaupt 
 I breath artist time fans the artist 
 Put a couple G's together before harvest light 
 I'll take all this 
 The hell I'm doin'? 
 Dippin this whole fuckin' pound in enbalmin fluids 
 You think I rhyme to do it? if it's (?on point?)) shot is 
 If you can't help but sleep peel off your eyelids. 
 (CamuTao) 
 It's the year 2010, you can say what you want 
 But I bet if you light this blunt, dummy, the feds'll come runnin' 
 Lock you up, lock you out, you ain't tryin' to listen 
 Cameras in your food, dude, look they're trying to listen 
 Lock you up, lock you out, we got bugs in the house 
 We're being monitored, they know we got thugs in the house 
 Don't light your blunt, bitch, they'll hit you with a switch 
 Hit you with a beam, hit you in the brain, make you go totally insane 
 Wild out, guns in the spot, flippin' on you niggas 
 They take you out, then the Feds push guns on the roof 
 They take 'em out, melt you out 'cause you know too much 
 After that you know your ho's get touched 
 Look, Then the meaning starts 
 Download your chip to a memory card 
 Give your chips and send 'em to a city job
