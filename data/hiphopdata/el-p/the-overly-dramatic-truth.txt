(1st verse) 
 I became for you what you had asked, telepath 
 You're too young to ask out loud, I'm too old to not know that 
 I can talk like you've not heard, I know weapons, you think words 
 I exposed you to these terms, you still chose to roll unheard 
 That could work but, I'm so fast, you're so open, I'm so crass 
 I'm too weak to hold that back, you still think intrigue will last 
 You can't imagine of my past, I just can't explain all that 
 I wish I could trade your place, so romantic full of faith 
 I must spare you, I must learn, I refuse to be your first 
 First to put you in your place, first to make you speed your pace 
 I'm a man now (good or bad), you're a girl still (good for you) 
 Don't think this don't make me sad, this is something I must do 
 Keep your own time (leave me be), trying to spare you 
 Trying to be God melodic, man on fire, Coward long gone, all desire 
 Fuck you raw now, it's my fault 
 Fuck you raw dog, I can't stop 
 Should've listened, should've left 
 I can't stop unless you're dead 
 It's so simple, open head, I will knit my savage thread 
 Help me help you, walk away, leave this unamazing grace 
 You don't know from pure disgrace, you still think I'm here to save 
 I'm not even really here, I can't give what I can't take 
 (2nd verse) 
 What a ride, what a slide under the door, what a score 
 You think I'm a genius, I know I'm a whore 
 What a time, what a climb in for our lives, what's in store 
 You seen lit forever, all I see is war 
 I will pull your hair back, fuck you on the floor 
 Pour myself into the act, poor myself, boohoo I'm bad 
 'Cause I know that these moments end, but telling you the truth is sad 
 You deserve the ignorance of bliss that I still wish I had 
 Don't you let me keep you here, don't ignore my greatest fear 
 I need you to not need me, you need not believe just flee 
 I will put myself inside you, find some way to run and hide you 
 I can't be responsible, do as I say, not as I do 
 Keep your own time, leave me be, I'm tryin' to spare you 
 Tryin' to be God melodic, man on fire, coward long gone, all desire 
 Fuck you raw now, it's my fault 
 Fuck you raw dog, I can't stop 
 Should've listened, should've left 
 I can't stop unless you're dead 
 It's so simple, open head, I will knit my savage thread 
 Help me help you, walk away, leave this unamazing grace 
 You don't know from pure disgrace, you still think I'm here to save 
 I'm not even really here, I can't give what I can't take 
 This is not my ego talkin', I know I'm no perfect draw 
 And I do love the way you lay there, I do like the way we talk 
 Maybe I'm just condescending, maybe this thing isn't wrong 
 Maybe you should lay right there, put your hands up in the air 
 Keep your own time, leave me be, I'm tryin' to spare you 
 Tryin' to be God melodic, man on fire, coward long gone, all desire 
 Fuck you raw now, it's your fault 
 Fuck you raw dog, I can't stop 
 Should've listened, should've left 
 I can't stop unless you're dead 
 It's so simple, open head, I will knit my savage thread 
 Help me help you, walk away, leave this unamazing grace 
 You don't know from pure disgrace, you still think I'm here to save 
 I was never even here, I can't give what I can't take 
 (Fades out) 
 You still think I'm here to save
