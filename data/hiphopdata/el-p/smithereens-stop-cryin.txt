Fell asleep late, neon buzz 
 P.T.S. stress, we do drugs 
 City air strange, sticky lungs 
 Mayor Doomburg gives no funds 
 And I'm cryin (cryin') 
 Call out with a fiendish ring 
 Broken into smithereens 
 Every thing's exactly how it seems and it would seem that I am 
 Cryin 
 In a world of super duper whores the kids just want a little more, 
 Little tycos do the bloody mind sex with a veteran's decor 
 So when I step in the stop frame I became pure BK 
 'Cause I grew up around the Krazy Kings and inhaled second hand spray 
 Where the walls talk your defiances and alliances were made 
 With a fugitive dash after class to harass the gods of fame 
 And the goons that I collude with on this rude shit same way 
 And will break a crab down in public just to manipulate they pain 
 Why should I be sober when God is so clearly dusted out his mind 
 With cherubs puffin above him tryna remember why he even tried 
 Down here its 30% every year to fund the worlds end 
 But I'm broke on Atlantic Ave. tryna cop the bootleg instead 
 Pure savage established hard rock talk circa 93 proof 
 Walk the high road to infinity with simile truant moves 
 When the wandering ration line derail I steal food 
 Maybe tread where the sidewalk hawks look alive and hide tools 
 On a bed that someone else made, tryna wait for the next boot 
 And it drops when you took prime-time hellemundo off mute 
 Old folks say "time to build", but demolition pays more loot 
 Rip patch from your hazmat suit, slip past with an odd bop (woop) 
 El-Producto sorta strange they say he stares at you long range 
 Perhaps he's lookin' at us all with his thousand yard gaze 
 And he sees how MC's became contorted with their own lies 
 And went from battle rap to gun talk like we ain't notice the change (yeah right) 
 It's the city I broke down in, the velour couture township 
 Where they lost the rock box batteries and forgot how shit was founded and I'm 
 Cryin 
 And critics all see me twisted, they don't get my whole existence 
 An actual b boy brainiac who'll smack you out your mittens 
 Now I feel that motherfuckers owe me dap for contributing actual raps 
 That's not a construct for the radio on that plasticine path 
 I'll be your homie, bust through the Dolby lonely, all cast aside and homely 
 Wildly pour chrome heat of vigilante words, insert hurt in a dome-piece 
 And the last of all I have is yours now surrendered nice and calmly 
 As a tot played on a block of bricks and double dutched with the zombies 
 I'll rip your squad with nothing but a cock ring on and a pair of puerto-rock dunks 
 I built the bag that cats will drown in when the water's colored rust 
 And the last thought that I had in the back of the little bus 
 Was of a Oklahoma City flair through kiddy flesh fade to dust 
 Move with me little soldier bitty, we'll cloak and dagger the city 
 We'll hope to stagger magnificence till the pattern of blasphemy's quitting 
 And I keep my meaning tucked deep so y'all creepers give me some privacy 
 Don't ask for something literal from a child of secret society 
 There's a position to be filled you fuckin' assholes, keep your eye on me 
 But save your precious advice cause all my life everyone's lied to me and I'm cryin 
 Fell asleep late, neon buzz 
 P.t.s. stress, we do drugs 
 City air strange, sticky lungs 
 Mayor doomburg gives no funds 
 And I'm cryin 
 Call out with a fiendish ring 
 Broken into smithereens 
 Every thing's exactly how it seems and it would seem that I am
