Just because I walk 
 Like Obi-Wan Kenobi 
 You people talk 
 But you don't even know me 
 But that's all right 
 'Cause I get down with GC 
 So I walk on 
 And listen to their CD 
 Some people laugh 
 They do it just to spite me 
 Behind my back 
 They don't know what I see 
 But I don't care what they say 
 I don't need them anyway 
 I'll just go about my day 
 But anyway 
 You go out on Friday night 
 I'll stay in but that's all alright 
 'Cause I have found a clique to call my own 
 In crowd, out crowd, I don't care 
 Your crowd, my crowd, we can share 
 'Cause I have found a clique to call my own 
 Let's go! 
 So come and talk to me 
 On my computer screen 
 The best years of our lives 
 Aren't as easy as they seem 
 But one day we'll look back 
 And then we'll have to laugh 
 They used to call us names 
 Now they want our autograph 
 To get the girl and make the grade 
 It's all a show it's all a game 
 And I would lose it if I played 
 It's all the same 
 So I don't care what they say 
 I don't need them anyway 
 I'll just go about my day 
 But anyway 
 You go out on Friday night 
 I'll stay in but that's all alright 
 'Cause I have found a clique to call my own 
 In crowd, out crowd, I don't care 
 Your crowd, my crowd, we can share 
 'Cause I have found a clique to call my own 
 She said she'd call 
 But I know she won't 
 She won't 
 She won't 
 You go out on Friday night 
 I'll stay in but that's all alright 
 'Cause I have found a clique to call my own 
 In crowd, out crowd, I don't care 
 Your crowd, my crowd, we can share 
 'Cause I have found a clique to call my own 
 I don't care what you say 
 I don't need you anyway 
 I'll just go about my day 
 But anyway 
 I don't care what you say 
 I don't need you anyway 
 I'll just go about my day 
 But anyway
