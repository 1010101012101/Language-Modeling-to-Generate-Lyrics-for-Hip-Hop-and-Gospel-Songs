(Tracey Lee): 
 Ha, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 For the '98 this is how we do 
 Queen Pen y'all, Tray Lee y'all 
 Rock on y'all, D-dot y'all 
 Come on 
 (Queen Pen): 
 For all the honeys in the ghetto 
 That's holdin' there own 
 Rock the body 
 (Tracey Lee): 
 For all my puffed out 
 Dogs in the club thugged out 
 Rock the body 
 (Queen Pen): 
 And if you know that it's a fact 
 That we got your back 
 Rock the body 
 (Tracey Lee): 
 Ain't no doubt 
 Queen and Tray Lee turn it out 
 Rock the body 
 : 
 (Tracey Lee): 
 Lyrically I spray y'all, it's Tray y'all 
 Slay y'all niggaz it ain't hard to face me 
 Break y'all niggaz like A.C. 
 Stay armed in case these cats want to hate on me 
 Kill or be killed, I'm God-sent 
 My calling making shit bounce like Spaulding 
 Y'all know cuevo mke Tray flow en fuego 
 Its T. Lee spitting and I'm down with the Queen 
 (Queen Pen): 
 Radio play just really advances my chances 
 With big time niggaz holdin' legal finances 
 Ghetto star just about the whole of my life 
 Got eyes in the back of my head like mice 
 With ya chat bat boy, I lived it 
 I figure you just wake up in the morning 
 And blamed it on a nigga, you's the type of nigga 
 I leave standing at the bar 
 Have your thirsty ass waiting for my car tomorrow 
 It's them lame chicks that fuck it up for us 
 Runnin' around the club being a bag of darts 
 A bonafide child I got years in this 
 Holding down fort, real Brooklyn shit 
 Weed rolled in fry talon dreads was rich 
 Ain't nothing changed since '86 
 We stopped transportin', start making hits 
 Ghetto from the start, Queen represent 
 (Queen Pen): 
 For all the honeys in the ghetto 
 That's holdin' there own 
 Rock the body, rock the body, rock 
 (Tracey Lee): 
 For all my puffed out 
 Dogs in the club thugged out 
 Rock the body, rock the body, rock 
 (Queen Pen): 
 And if you know that it's a fact 
 That we got your back 
 Rock the body, rock the body, rock 
 (Tracey Lee): 
 Ain't no doubt 
 Queen and Tray Lee turn it out 
 Rock the body, rock the body, rock 
 (Queen Pen): 
 Niggaz talk shit on the regular 
 And those be the one's that's sweatin' y'all 
 Whether east or west D servin' ya 
 Tray Lee and the Queen Pen murderer 
 If it's not real boo then why bother 
 Tell me why windows shot wit bags of copper 
 Jack yo ass up like my baby father 
 I said jack your ass up like my baby father 
 (Tracey Lee): 
 When Tray Lee come through it's party time 
 But a party ain't a party till you spark a dime 
 Y'all can hate but I'm a still make ass shake 
 Still got the steel by the waist runnin' through y'all 
 Me and Queen Pen find us at the bar schemin' 
 I still owe dough, so who I gotta get to break even 
 RNF niggaz who live for the weekend 
 Still drinkin', hey still leaving the club with hoes 
 They seen us on Keenan 
 You dealin' with pros, goddamn 
 Future of the game turning cats into "what happen to's" 
 Like Brains, Tray ain't change 
 Still spit on, still ride everything that I get on 
 Still be in the club with Timbs on 
 Raw dog forever, I got something for all y'all 
 Whatever 
 (Repeat Chorus 2 till end)
