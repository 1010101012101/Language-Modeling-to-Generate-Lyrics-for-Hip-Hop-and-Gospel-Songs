 Break it down now 
 TR 
 (QueenPen of the click) 
 Little man 
 Funky Mama represent hah 
 Me and my boys 
 We forced to do big things this year 
 Make a lot of noise in this here 
 We comes through with the multiple ends 
 Stead flows through with the multiple Benzes 
 Cartier lenses 
 Me and my mens is 
 Bout to take over with the vengeance 
 Watch your spot 'cause we hot to trot 
 See we plotted for the top spot 
 And that's what we got 
 Now we holding like combo rom dom flows 
 Queen throw her nookie like Madonna 9 4 
 What?! Y'all ain't know? 
 Untold damage shit 
 I got the flow that you can't through managed 
 Make you all vanish like Copperfield 
 Drop to the bottom 
 To the rise 
 To the top of the field 
 Drop your shield 
 Y'all going to be OK 
 And I'll be much sleeker in the COK 
 'Cause I am 
 (Chorus by Teddy Riley) 
 ---The QueenPen of the click 
 The littlest G with the hottest shit 
 Here's one thing y'all should never forget 
 That she flows like now other chick 
 (I am) 
 The QueenPen of the click 
 The littlest G with the hottest shit 
 Here's one thing y'all should never forget 
 That she flows like now other chick 
 (QueenPen) 
 ---Rock chicks I'm dying from boredom please 
 I can't wait for y'all to fall like autumn leaves 
 So I can shine like six for these 
 The less for y'all, the more for me 
 I puts it down like bad kids 
 Stop the madness shit 
 I roast y'all bitches with ad libs 
 This garbage should stop 
 When the hottest shit drops 
 And y'all can't front on this shit knocks 
 Even haters got to love to state us on a status 
 Y'all wanna help get that ass? 
 Hey you 
 Want a debut number one like we do 
 You gots to roll with my crew 
 We gots to pause with the rims 
 Got the rings in the ice 
 Put it all together, let it all gleam nice 
 Got to pay a mean price you go against my click 
 And here's one thing y'all should never forget 
 That I am 
 (Chorus by Teddy Riley) 
 (QueenPen) 
 ---I run circles around you birds 
 Straight serve you 
 Day to night we keep it tight like a girdle 
 Nine to five y'all should make it your job 
 To keep QueenPen close to your ears like a bob 
 We make this world revolve with this music of ours 
 From S50's the music guitars 
 You know the program 
 That no man interrupt your flow 
 And if that's your man 
 You better let him know I'm like a Damian Oman 
 Six, six, six 
 The way I've been flowing is sick, sick, sick 
 Ice broke glowing 
 Focus on arithmetic 
 More that that to get close to this 
 Straight hits I mean with my nigga TR 
 And him and I be straight shining 
 It's all in the timing and how this shit clicks 
 And here's one thing y'all should never forget 
 That I am 
 (Chorus by Teddy Riley) 
 (QueenPen) 
 ---Yeah this is dedicated to Crown Heights Brooklyn 
 To all my street team 
 That finally made it 
 You saw we made it 
 Here I am 
 I'm out
