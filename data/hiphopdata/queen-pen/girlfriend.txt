(Feat. Me'shell Ndegeocello) 
 Queen Pen: Me'shell Ndegeocello, play for me, c'mon talk to me 
 Me'shell: anyone know, it never ceases to amaze me how everbody's always in 
 Somebody else's business, looking for something, but 'cha know, for what 
 It's worth - 
 We could give a fuck! 
 Me'shell: Girlfriend, girlfriend, yes I had your girlfriend 
 Queen Pen: If that was your girlfriend, if that was your girlfriend, if that 
 Was your girlfriend, she wasn't last night [x2] 
 Now how you just gon' be playa hatin' on me 
 'Cause I got mad bitches just wanting me 
 And I got mad niggaz just checkin' for me see 
 I got more stock than you ever see, I be... 
 The one that your main squeeze been diggin 
 Pull you out your closet, sex on weekends 
 It's my business of what I do, him or her, he or she, inside you 
 So while you be yappin' and talkin' to your friends 
 Beefin 'bout that yellow chicken, the green benz 
 I'll be havin' all your people's info with the second part of my ??? 
 She slid the number, what you gettin' mad at me for 
 She said she was single when she closed my car door 
 Me'shell: so queen tell me, where did you meet her, 
 Queen Pen: 
 On the Sunday, mac, she was walking out ??? 
 I was just chillin', mindin my own business 
 Sittin' on the corner, waitin for my sister 
 When she slid by, maybe 4 or 5 times 
 Wanted me to notice the rhythm of her thighs 
 Oh boy, uh, girls are just so funny to me 
 I can see how niggas get into these beefs 
 She knew she had a man when she came up in the piece 
 She said she was a regular and how about me, 
 If she gave me her digits would I call her after three 
 The way she fliked her hips made you move to have to see 
 How these Chinese jamaican tried to draw it by me 
 It never ceases to amaze me 
 [Me'shell:] Ain't nobody gotta know just how much you want me 
 Now how I've ran, you've only a few 
 But you can back track and ask them how I do it how it is 
 Who the flyest chick, with the phattest whip 
 And run her all night, like a burger with a chip 
 And if it's all good then I feature it again 
 Like a fix remix, (if you need a fix) 
 See you gots to be real like my ex beverly 
 You don't have your man just stressin out on me 
 'Cause he can't control how you throw your pussy 
 I'm a baller and I been for a ??? 
 And if I choose to jerk her off then it's all on me 
 See you claimed that was your girl, well that's not how it seems 
 Uh, it never ceases to amaze me 
 [Me'shell:] 'Cause I like to get down so if you's wants ta I will 
 I love to love ya' baby
