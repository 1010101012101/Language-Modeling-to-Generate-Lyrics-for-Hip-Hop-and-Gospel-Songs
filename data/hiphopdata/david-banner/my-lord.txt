In this biatch, hit that 
 I'm fucked up, shit 
 All the soldiers, stand up now 
 My Lord, I'm losing my soul and my mind 
 The Devil creeping 'cause I keep on fallin' behind 
 My Lord, I'm losing my soul and my mind 
 The Devil creeping 'cause I keep on fallin' behind 
 My Lord, I'm losing my soul, hey, I'm losing my mind 
 My Lord, I'm losing my soul, hey, I'm losing my mind 
 This Hennessey got me on my knees, screamin', "God please 
 Let my people be free who fightin' off over seas" 
 For a man who don't give a fuck, who steals slaves 
 Jesus, I'm tryin' to walk the path that you gave 
 Goin' down a new world order 
 Got my boys on the corner tryin' to flip a quarter 
 I'm in the east coast, I'm tryin' to soak in this dirty ass water 
 And my ex-girlfriend said I got a little daughter 
 My Lord, I'm losing my soul and my mind 
 The Devil creeping 'cause I keep on fallin' behind 
 My Lord, I'm losing my soul and my mind 
 The Devil creeping 'cause I keep on fallin' behind 
 My Lord, I'm losing my soul, hey, I'm losing my mind 
 My Lord, I'm losing my soul, hey, I'm losing my mind 
 I got more places where niggas wanna kill me, fill me with slugs 
 I got some nothing they suck 'cause I don't give a fuck 
 About nothing man Michelle died, a nigga cried and I let it go 
 I gives a fuck about a hoe 
 Give me dough my nuda my acres bustin' at you fakers 
 Killin' you quakers in the name of my maker 
 Patty cake, patty cake bakers man give me land 
 I'm tryin' to live life in Gods plan man, damn 
 My Lord, I'm losing my soul and my mind 
 The Devil creeping 'cause I keep on fallin' behind 
 My Lord, I'm losing my soul and my mind 
 The Devil creeping 'cause I keep on fallin' behind 
 My Lord, I'm losing my soul, hey, I'm losing my mind 
 My Lord, I'm losing my soul, hey, I'm losing my mind 
 Yeah, searchin' the raggly tags for what I'm 'bout to ask 
 Lord, I be feelin' all alone and I'm goin' fast 
 Another day in the high feelin' goody good 
 Still the same ole weed man it's understood 
 Pop, pop and gone in the wind victims of ghetto war 
 Busted up and over seas what are we fightin' for 
 Something busted in me pussy niggas trip 
 But I stay ready for you bitches with the extra clip 
 Killas that live on the side 
 So I get aim at fame triple crossin' bosses 
 They so quick to erase yo' name rippin' the rains is a slide 
 That's goin' about my side, Lord, I hope I know I'm doin' wrong 
 I know you still by my side, losin' my mind 
 My Lord, I'm losing my soul and my mind 
 The Devil creeping 'cause I keep on fallin' behind 
 My Lord, I'm losing my soul and my mind 
 The Devil creeping 'cause I keep on fallin' behind 
 My Lord, I'm losing my soul, hey, I'm losing my mind 
 My Lord, I'm losing my soul, hey, I'm losing my mind 
 Yeah, south side nigga
