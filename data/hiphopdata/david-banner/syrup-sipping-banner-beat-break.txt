A see what's crazy to me is, 
 We didn't subliminally became what they think we are anyway 
 And like we just some ol' country ass dumb niggas 
 And we not that we so much more fucking that dude 
 And mama told me somethin', she said, 
 You being a visionary is your curse as well as a blessing 
 She said you gonna be blessed with visions 
 That regular niggas ain't gonna be able to see, that's gonna make you be alone
