This is where the young folks are born 
 And the old people die 
 We're just tryin' to get by 
 Tell 'em meet me at the crossroads 
 If your the good or the bad 
 If you gotta choose now 
 We gonna make it some how 
 Tell 'em meet me at the crossroads 
 This is where the young folks are born 
 And the old people die 
 We're just tryin' to get by 
 Tell 'em meet me at the crossroads 
 If your the good or the bad 
 If you gotta choose now 
 We gonna make it some how 
 Tell 'em meet me at the crossroads 
 The candy lady told me 
 It's y'all late 
 Dem demons comin' 
 My souls tight 
 Bodys old, let I'm sick of runnin' 
 You better pray 
 One day, look you gotta choose 
 Right or wrong, you gone, young man make a move 
 Revelations drawn closer 
 Man a 3 headed beast 
 The chosen one might not rise from the east 
 South side ima ride till the gas gone 
 I wish I could call Jesus up on the phone 
 Like lord I'm still burnin from the slave trade 
 Can't reproduce 'cause our folks got aids 
 The black folks is killin' black folks, not gays 
 I spray the AK and pray, why were you late 
 This is where the young folks are born 
 And the old people die 
 We're just tryin' to get by 
 Tell 'em meet me at the crossroads 
 If your the good or the bad 
 If you gotta choose now 
 We gonna make it some how 
 Tell 'em meet me at the crossroads 
 This is where the young folks are born 
 And the old people die 
 We're just tryin' to get by 
 Tell 'em meet me at the crossroads 
 If your the good or the bad 
 If you gotta choose now 
 We gonna make it some how 
 Tell 'em meet me at the crossroads 
 Cut my wrists in fear 
 When do I go from here 
 My mind's less than clear 
 Do I turn in shame 
 From what could save 
 Do I find my knees and pray? 
 Its great, lord 
 I'm sorry for my sins 
 I prepare for the end 
 You just let me know when 
 Its hard like a boulder 
 This world's gettin' colder 
 But ima stand strong 
 Till you call for your soldiers 
 This is where the young folks are born 
 And the old people die 
 We're just tryin' to get by 
 Tell 'em meet me at the crossroads 
 If your the good or the bad 
 If you gotta choose now 
 We gonna make it some how 
 Tell 'em meet me at the crossroads 
 This is where the young folks are born 
 And the old people die 
 We're just tryin' to get by 
 Tell 'em meet me at the crossroads 
 If your the good or the bad 
 If you gotta choose now 
 We gonna make it some how 
 Tell 'em meet me at the crossroads 
 Let the devil come and go 
 Tell 'em let my soul be 
 'Cause I got the lord with me 
 Let the devil come and go 
 Tell 'em let my soul be 
 'Cause I got the lord with me 
 We were blind now we see 
 In the end we'll be free 
 We were blind now we see 
 In the end we'll be free 
 This is where the young folks are born 
 And the old people die 
 We're just tryin' to get by 
 Tell 'em meet me at the crossroads 
 If your the good or the bad 
 If you gotta choose now 
 We gonna make it some how 
 Tell 'em meet me at the crossroads 
 This is where the young folks are born 
 And the old people die 
 We're just tryin' to get by 
 Tell 'em meet me at the crossroads 
 If your the good or the bad 
 If you gotta choose now 
 We gonna make it some how 
 Tell 'em meet me at the crossroads 
 Tell 'em meet me at the crossroads
