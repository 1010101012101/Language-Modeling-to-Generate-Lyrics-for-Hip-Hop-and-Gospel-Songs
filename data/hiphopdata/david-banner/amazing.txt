I be goin' ham, I be goin' crazy 
 I be goin' hard, hard enough to have a baby 
 They go, "Oh" and tell me I'm amazin' 
 They go, "Oh" and tell me I'm amazin' 
 'Cause I be goin' ham, I be goin' crazy 
 I be goin' hard, hard enough to have a baby 
 They go, "Oh" and tell me I'm amazin' 
 They go, "Oh" and tell me I'm amazin', oh 
 She said she headed my way, pronto 
 Come up to the penthouse suite, condo 
 She only come over to get bathed, bongo 
 Come tonight, stay until the mornin', Alonzo 
 She said she tryin' to come, can I assist, Rondo? 
 Headed to the bedroom? Nah, follow 
 She like a wack rapper, no spit, swallow 
 She told me I'm the best and I respond, "Yeah, I know" 
 That's sort of like my motto 
 See it in her eye a little fear, madam 
 Hop up in my push-back seat, Phantom 
 It only happens for a small few, no random 
 Now let me shoot it in your Mariah, Cannon 
 I be goin' ham, I be goin' crazy 
 I be goin' hard, hard enough to have a baby 
 They go, "Oh" and tell me I'm amazin' 
 They go, "Oh" and tell me I'm amazin' 
 'Cause I be goin' ham, I be goin' crazy 
 I be goin' hard, hard enough to have a baby 
 They go, "Oh" and tell me I'm amazin' 
 They go, "Oh" and tell me I'm amazin', oh 
 Hey, lil' mama, won't ya freak some? 
 You and your girlfriend together, that's a threesome 
 You are my sex slave, don't want your freedom 
 We do it over and over, here we come 
 Hey, lil' mama, won't ya freak some?

 Yeah, baby, hop up in my sweet front seat, Mercedes 
 I know that you had couple drinks, faded 
 Said she feelin' good, let me make it 
 Better than it was, so what you think, later? 
 You could meet me at my hotel suite, naked 
 She was like, "Nah", I'm like, "Pssh, better take it" 
 So used to being regular, she don't understand 
 A man ten steps ahead of her 
 Yeah, I can change your decimal 
 I'm your lottery ticket, have you scratchin' like eczema 
 She seein' lights like a signal and I'm askin' 
 "What ya all up on me for?" 'Cause we go 
 I be goin' ham, I be goin' crazy 
 I be goin' hard, hard enough to have a baby 
 They go, "Oh" and tell me I'm amazin' 
 They go, "Oh" and tell me I'm amazin' 
 'Cause I be goin' ham, I be goin' crazy 
 I be goin' hard, hard enough to have a baby

 They go, "Oh" and tell me I'm amazin', oh 
 She only come over to get bathed, bongo
