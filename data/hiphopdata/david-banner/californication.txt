In californication, yeah, bitch I'm from the country but that don't make a nigga soft 
 Big city niggas come south and get their wigs knocked off 
 Tell me, I just hustle and flow 
 Find a track to start and pimp on a hoe 
 The block got hot a nigga, had to get low 
 Get the fuck out of dodge and hit my uncle on the east side 
 Trevon, wharrup neph what's cracking 
 I wanna visit L.A., I'm already packed 
 Been already stacking so we gonna get turned up 
 Soon as you land, purple kush gonna get burnt up 
 Shit, the next day I'm in the LAX 
 Uncle Trey pulled up in a Camaro SS 
 Black on black, sitting on 23 
 Bumping rich boy like bitch throw some of these 
 2 bad bitches in the back seat, one of them for me 
 Next kid I will name Marie 
 Rolling up some trees on the 1-0-5 east 
 Roll down the window, just to feel the breeze 
 It's real nice, feeling like paradise (sheesh) 
 And all I can see is sunshine and palm trees 
 Welcome to californication 
 Welcome to californication 
 Where we're going? To the hood 
 Now I wanna see the swat and the green shower slugs 
 Fool, that's where the cops be 
 Nigga, I ain't got no driver's license or assurance 
 Sure enough the cops put us over on corners 
 Everybody out the car, the cops set us on the curve 
 They searched the ashtray and found a roach full of herbs 
 What's this in that cigar? Medical marijuana officer 
 I got a weed call 
 What condition you smoke weed for? 
 Trevon Jones, place your hands behind your back 
 You're under arrest for warrants go to court tornt Monday 
 Monday? It's Wednesday man, 
 Or maybe Tuesday, you heard me ma'am 
 Now if you keep it up, I'll arrest you for obstruction of justice 
 Trev like, take the car, fuck this 
 Have fun, call my homies, go clubbing with your dumb ass 
 At least they ain't found my gun stash 
 Welcome to californication, you might come for vacation 
 Welcome to californication, you might leave on probation 
 Welcome to californication, everyone knows, anything goes 
 Welcome to californication, in californication 
 I dropped the bitches off, now I'm off to my uncle house 
 Stopped by the liquor store, nothing but the thugs out 
 White teeth and chunks when niggas hit me up like 
 Where you from homie? 
 Lifted up his shirt on me, Colt 45 
 And dawg I wouldn't strap another would walk up like 
 Nah, he cool, that's Dave Black, Tray lo folks 
 Visiting from Mississippi, 
 Pass the pine of Hennesey, here sip this with me 
 I'm Javon, we're gonna get it popping tonight 
 Wassup, Hollywood around, these niggas are flocking at night 
 What's flocking? Breaking in homes, BNE, burglary nigga, damn you slow 
 Oh we kicked it in the hood drinking smoking kush twist up 
 Hood rat with the big butt chose up got our dicks up 
 Kissed my auntie on the cheek see you laters 
 Now we 5 niggas deep and J bonds Navigator 
 The club's off the chain, I'm seeing models and stars 
 NBA players straight buying out bars 
 The state of Arizona tryna segragate 
 But my dick don't discriminate, 
 Black girls white girls, pimping I just like girls 
 California girls, Katy Perry tight girls 
 Met an Asian with fake tits next to a hype girl 
 She took a pot of breath sniffing on that white girl 
 VIP bottles and all that, this sun branded nigga started pouring out cognac 
 I said Pipin what you doin'? He said fuck you too 
 And that's the last thing he do and 
 I took a bottle and I cracked that nigga, smacked that nigga 
 Security bust me like arrest that nigga 
 Tearing up the club, all 5 of us 
 Asian bitch grab me like hurry up slide with us 
 But the cops were outside stopped her, detained me 
 Found some coke in her purse, motherfuckers blame me 
 Next thing you know I'm in the county jail 
 I walked in the cell, my uncle Tray's right there 
 And he's just shaking his head then he laughed at a nigga 
 Don't be in the bed, don't let the bright lights fool ya and lay you trinket bless 
 It's been 24 hours I just caught my first case 
 I'm just here to see the Hollywood sign get locked up 
 Niggas doin' crazy, tribe lights get popped up 
 As they tripping on me for no reason 
 Jail politics, county niggas in season 
 Welcome to californication, you might come for vacation 
 Welcome to californication, you might leave on probation 
 I'm telling you that 
 Welcome to californication, anyone goes, everything goes 
 Welcome to californication, in californication
