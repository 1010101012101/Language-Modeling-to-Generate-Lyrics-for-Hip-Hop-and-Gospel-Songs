I'm a king yes I'm a dime, nigger what you want? 
 And I'm off to yeager bombs, and I'm your daddy 'cause I pay your mum 
 And it's hard to hate on niggers, when you the most hated on 
 You know what? I don't give a fuck, your girls pussy's my cologne 
 And she's on my private jet, she says she wanna try that mile high 
 Jungle better be shaved 'cause I ain't fucking wildlife 
 And she's smoking loud right, can you here me now? 
 But she still be super high when my plane be touching down 
 Can't tell me stop it 'cause I'm gon' cop it 
 Anything you got my goonz gone rob it 
 Nigger it's my time and you can't clock it 
 And I'm throwing racks, tell that nigger pop it 
 And she the best dancer going hammer 
 And this new girl way better 
 What's my name? you know the answer 
 Who did the beat? 
 And bitch I'm tall as Yao Ming 
 And bitch I'm tall as Yao Ming 
 Look at my daddy, look at my daddy 
 Look at my daddy, look at my daddy 
 Yao Ming 
 Look at my daddy, look at my daddy 
 Look at my daddy, look at my daddy 
 It's all about my business, start collecting interests 
 Fill my own wishlist so everyday it's Christmas 
 I don't have no time to wait, I need my money with the quickness 
 Ain't nothing like fast money, can I get a witness 
 They say that I've been gone, now say what you mean 
 Bitch, if I fell off I landed on the movie screen 
 They think I'm off the scene, but it ain't what it seems 
 They wonder why my self-esteem is called that Yao Ming 
 My money coming in, that shit coming out 
 You can gon' bump your guns, I put this pistol in your mouth 
 Mississippi motherfucker, ho I'm from the south 
 If you ain't talking 'bout no money, then bitch don't open up your mouth 
 And bitch I'm tall as Yao Ming 
 And bitch I'm tall as Yao Ming 
 Look at my daddy, look at my daddy 
 Look at my daddy, look at my daddy 
 Yao Ming 
 Look at my daddy, look at my daddy 
 Look at my daddy, look at my daddy 
 It's mister pretty muthafucka 
 Bitch I am the trill man 
 Spit that gangsta boogie 
 In my zone, but they still dance 
 Them raiders be like haters 
 We the trill clan, no the real clan 
 Think where you got your style from 
 You niggas old as my lil man 
 'Cause I'm ready to go 
 She next to blow 
 Like her fat ass, baby flexible 
 Got a gallery with collectibles 
 I pay my taxes, eat my vegetables 
 I'm Texas throwed, my necklace gold 
 Keep a bad bitch, couple naked hoes 
 A couple of deals with no records sold 
 That comma comma decimal 
 Grippin and spittin' that tech 
 Come for respect 
 Trippin', I'm flippin your neck 
 All on my set when I'm pitchin' and flippin' that wet 
 Then the dealers feelin' a threat 
 Shawty dancin' got a whole lot of ass on her 
 She don't like to jig it, nigga I'm a pass on her 
 I said I'm off of the hook 
 She open off of my looks 
 I got her braiding my hair 
 I got her rolling my kush 
 I told her I am a crook 
 Because her heart's what I took 
 Holla if you need a job lil mama 
 It's off of the books 
 And bitch I'm tall as Yao Ming 
 And bitch I'm tall as Yao Ming 
 Look at my daddy, look at my daddy 
 Look at my daddy, look at my daddy 
 Yao Ming 
 Look at my daddy, look at my daddy 
 Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
