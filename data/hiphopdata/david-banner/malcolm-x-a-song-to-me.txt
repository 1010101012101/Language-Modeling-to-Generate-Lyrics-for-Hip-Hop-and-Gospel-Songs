This grown men shit 
 I don't wanna teach 'em 
 I don't wanna teach him how to sell, choppin', cook, yell 
 All my baby rappers either dead or in jail 
 I don't wanna teach 'em, I don't wanna teach 'em 
 I don't wanna teach 'em, I don't wanna teach 'em 
 Don't wanna teach these little girls to put their pussy on the pole 
 And at the end of the night get that money off the floor 
 I don't wanna teach 'em, I don't wanna teach 'em 
 I don't wanna teach 'em, I don't wanna teach 'em 
 What about Patrice, Malcolm he would be 
 I don't want these kids to grow up and be me 
 I don't wanna teach 'em 
 I used to teach 'em 
 'Bout what? Knock 'em out 
 Them pussy niggas nah I'm talkin' bout 
 Big dope, big weight 
 We only sell to us, self hate 
 Big guns, we only shootin' us 
 Big pimpin', dumb fucks 
 No revolution, they dead broke 
 No history on black folks 
 We fucked up, y'all niggas know it 
 These kids are our way, me and Tony 
 You ain't got keys, no bricks 
 Bitch boy niggas, no dicks 
 And if you sellin' in the hood why you proud nigga? 
 Them eye pokes, getting high nigga 
 These our kids in real life 
 You rappin' 'bout what what they living like 
 I don't wanna teach him how to selll, choppin', cook, yell 
 All my baby rappers either dead or in jail 
 I don't wanna teach 'em, I don't wanna teach 'em 
 I don't wanna teach 'em, I don't wanna teach 'em 
 Don't wanna teach these little girls to put their pussy on the pole 
 And at the end of the night get that money off the floor 
 I don't wanna teach 'em, I don't wanna teach 'em 
 I don't wanna teach 'em, I don't wanna teach 'em 
 What about Patrice, Malcolm he would be 
 I don't want these kids to grow up and be me 
 I don't wanna teach 'em 
 Certain rappers gonna want beef 
 This ain't 'bout y'all, it's about me 
 My soul, our kids 
 White folks, their dope and our cribs 
 Big chains, big whips 
 'Round your neck and our wrist 
 No bullshit, no mystery, a man ain't shit on this earth without history 
 The only thing they gonna say about black folks 
 We like to fuck hoes and sell dope 
 Shoot jump shots and run balls 
 Take white money and give it right back at the mall 
 Louis Vuitton, hate niggas 
 Gucci hate niggas, Hilfiger been said fuck niggas 
 I admit that I wear that shit too 
 But black folks the first to yell fuck FUBU. 
 I don't wanna teach him how to selll, choppin', cook, yell 
 All my baby rappers either dead or in jail 
 I don't wanna teach 'em, I don't wanna teach 'em 
 I don't wanna teach 'em, I don't wanna teach 'em 
 Don't wanna teach these little girls to put their pussy on the pole 
 And at the end of the night get that money off the floor 
 I don't wanna teach 'em, I don't wanna teach 'em 
 I don't wanna teach 'em, I don't wanna teach 'em 
 What about Patrice, Malcolm he would be 
 I don't want these kids to grow up and be me
