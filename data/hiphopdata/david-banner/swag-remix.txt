Everybody in my city pushing keys and that's all these kids see 
 That's the only thing they hear then that's the only thing they'll be, 
 We call it swag, swag, swag 
 We call it swag, swag, swag 
 The homies is busting slugs, the women is shaking ass 
 The white girls call us "nigga" and we just sit back and laugh 
 And call it swag, swag, swag 
 We call it swag, swag, swag 
 Banner, let me get them, let me speak up 
 Let me tell them bout swag, let me tell them bout fraud 
 Let me tell them bout fraud and growing up black in a land so cold 
 You can freeze your soul if you don't have your wits about you 
 I allowed you, if you talk that swag should... 
 I been chilling on tour around the world 
 And most of the egos really don't move me 
 I came from the hood but I came up good 
 My mama raised me right, 
 I was more into Malcolm than into talkcom 
 Different kind of fight 
 I see niggas sell out who they really are for fame and money 
 Denounce a profit just for profit with no interest to stop it 
 My calculations showing as the people we regressing 
 Most of the rappers I know they're intelligent 
 But they would never bless you with a lesson 
 They would rather feed you to bitches, drugs and guns 
 Like fucking clowns 
 They ain't concerned with your block 'cause they in the burbs now 
 What's worse, a white supremacy plotting to kill you with evil? 
 Or black faces on the TV poisoning our people 
 Mentally in the streets, our brains are in a body bag 
 I hope you vote Obama twice, but some of you won't 
 Just blame it on your swags, swags, swags 
 Everybody in my city pushing keys and that's all these kids see 
 That's the only thing they hear then that's the only thing they'll be, 
 We call it swag, swag, swag 
 We call it swag, swag, swag 
 The homies is busting slugs, the women is shaking ass 
 The white girls call us "nigga" and we just sit back and laugh 
 And call it swag, swag, swag 
 We call it swag, swag, swag 
 Is anybody on the next level 
 With me, I'm hearing niggas disregard 
 Y'all think it's witty, 
 I ain't laughing, we don't play in Mississippi 
 Even when I was broke, selling my soul wasn't tempted 
 Now the white cop shoot a black kid 
 You will see if you twist that's it 
 You march for a minute, that's it 
 Get a new outfit, and it goes like this 
 Cook, swag, cook, swag 
 A black kid did me, nobody made 
 They won't speak the truth, these niggas been scared 
 Call my flow the pudding, the proof's in there 
 I say the shit they say I shouldn't I ain't never cared 
 I've been everywhere the game spitted and left it there 
 I brought a couple slugs to your hood, pray I don't leave them there 
 I hope that you don't give me a reason, double dare 
 I'm hard to scare, I'm what they fear, a black planet 
 Everybody in my city pushing keys and that's all these kids see 
 That's the only thing they hear then that's the only thing they'll be, 
 We call it swag, swag, swag 
 We call it swag, swag, swag 
 The homies is busting slugs, the women is shaking ass 
 The white girls call us "nigga" and we just sit back and laugh 
 And call it swag, swag, swag 
 We call it swag, swag, swag
