Hello it's Mr. David Banner, your bitch eater 
 I suggest that you don't kiss or hug her and don't eat her 
 I Run DMC's in this bitch in my adidas 
 I was chose to expose when you chose as a leader 
 Yes I'm fresh like a rose picked from the garden of Eden 
 I'm stepped out the rose my game rose like Easter 
 I got a couple bitches that's painted like Mona Lisa 
 Now I fuck 'em at my leisure and I never touch my visa 
 So ghetto, my kicks so retro, got nuts like a rhino, call them Mark Echo

 Try to get up in the bed with her 
 And put my third leg in her

 Waiting for one of these niggas to cross the line, like a touchdown
