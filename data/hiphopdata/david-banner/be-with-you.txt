I want you to be with you 
 One for the money (yes sir) 
 Two for the show 
 Three for all the ladies just standing outside my door 
 Yelling Oh It's that Mister David Banner 
 If I say yes she wants me to be her like I got ... 
 My sedated walk to the bus with the PIMPS... 
 Open up my head and say yes 
 And then come with me 
 I just want to be with you 
 I got a bar in the bus 
 We can discuss feature plans 
 Me and you and all your friends 
 We could visit for our lands 
 Like showers in ... 
 Bear foot in South ... 
 Would this ... served with bear hands 
 That's back in Mississippi 
 All you gotta do is close your eyes 
 And come with me girl 
 I wanna be with you 
 I told her 
 I got the chips 
 If you got the dip 
 She said when I did 
 Better be equipped 
 I'll keep my hand on her hips 
 I told her give me all you got 
 Until your given is gone 
 She said her love is eternal 
 And I won't be living that long 
 Well I'm not immortal 
 But I swear I'm no wimp 
 'Cause I die twice 
 And keep coming back as a pimp 
 Too close for comfort 
 Too close of home 
 You're too close from the front of the stage 
 To be alone 
 Here's my number 
 When I'm gone 
 You can call me on the phone 
 I don't buy it being shy 
 You're supposed to be grown 
 Be smart on her past 
 Holly Marry is being ... 
 I wanna be with you 
 Now put your hands up in the air 
 Yeah them where I can see them 
 Put put them away 'cause where I'm about to take you 
 You won't need them 
 I'll treat them 
 Forever please 
 Scream and squeezing and breathing hard 
 Believe in Luda like you believe in God 
 Alleluia please pass the ... 
 You're so weat that I'll be calling out for oxygen 
 I just wanna be with you 
 Those huge baby eyes 
 Keep running off at the mouth 
 And you're telling me 
 How you learn these rappers from the South 
 Thinking how I ... I just wish that your soul ... 
 We can go to Planet Lack with a land that made us love it 
 You can lay off on your back ... 
 So you know it stays black girl 
 I wanna be with you 
 Look I'm one of the best guys 
 Not one of your ex-guys 
 If you get drunk don't worry 
 I'm gonna let my sex drive 
 I'll keep my hands on the wheel 
 If you put them in reverse 
 Put on you safety belt 
 I'll put you in rehearse 
 Your frame will ... to women the same size 
 You're so fine 
 I'm about to put you in my Fab Five 
 I wanna be with you
