Know what I'm talkin' 'bout 
 Mississippi mothafucka, Newton county 
 What I live and die for, ball for da kids 
 Know what I'm talkin' 'bout 
 Niggas out here flashin' and ballin' and shit 
 Know what I'm talkin' 'bout, I'm supposed to be so hard 
 Fuckin' rebel flags still flyin', fuck 'em, some hoes 
 We from a place, where dem boys still pimpin' them hoes 
 We from a place, Cadillacs still ridin' on vogues 
 We from a place, where my soul still don't feel free 
 Where a flag means more than me, in Mississippi 
 (In Mississippi) 
 We from a place, where dem boys still pimpin' them hoes 
 We from a place, Cadillacs still ridin' on vogues 
 We from a place, where my soul still don't feel free 
 Where a flag means more than me 
 Still ridin' Cadillacs, still bump in the back 
 Mothafuckas talk shit but we still in the hood 
 Mississippi in this thang, Pinky rang in my hand 
 Peanut butta top, lovin' wood 
 Crackas only come to buy crack 
 And cracka cops only come to bust niggas who sell that 
 We from a place where dey scream 
 Pimp a hoe, pimp a hoe 
 We from a place where dey still 
 Chop dem boes, chop dem boes 
 We from a place where yo grandmama still showin' you love 
 And we still eatin' chicken in the club bitch 
 We from a place, where dem boys still pimpin' them hoes 
 We from a place, Cadillacs still ridin' on vogues 
 We from a place, where my soul still don't feel free 
 Where a flag means more than me 
 (In Mississippi) 
 We from a place, where dem boys still pimpin' them hoes 
 We from a place, Cadillacs still ridin' on vogues 
 We from a place, where my soul still don't feel free 
 Where a flag means more than me 
 We from a place, where mega evers live and mega evers died 
 We from a place, what we chokin on sticky green to get high 
 We from a place, where ya used to come in the summatime 
 Now y'all don't mention us in ya rhyme we kin folk, ya we broke 
 Some talk wit' a drawl but bitch we ball 
 Runnin' through wit' two techs screamin' fuck all y'all 
 We from a place, where da rebel flag still ain't burnin' 
 New schools but the black kids still ain't learnin' 'bout shit 
 But hit da streets and learn to pimp on a bitch 
 Five-O aw shit throw, yo crack in the ditch 
 And y'all nigga run, y'all nigga run like Forrest Gump 
 They got pumps and them crooked cops love to dump in Mississippi 
 We from a place, where dem boys still pimpin' them hoes 
 We from a place, Cadillacs still ridin' on vogues 
 We from a place, where my soul still don't feel free 
 Where a flag means more than me 
 (In Mississippi) 
 We from a place, where dem boys still pimpin' them hoes 
 We from a place, Cadillacs still ridin' on vogues 
 We from a place, where my soul still don't feel free 
 Where a flag means more than me
