Ain't no tellin' where I might be 
 I got places to go, and people to see 
 Ain't no tellin' where I end up 
 I got shows to rock and hoes to fuck 
 Ain't no tellin' where I might go 
 Coast to coast or just next door 
 But... I gots to go. 
 Roll up on the tour bus, smokin' a blunt 
 Then heard a duh duh duh duh 
 What chya baby mama want? 
 Nothin' but good fuckin', dick suckin, train runnin' 
 She lickin' on my nuts, cocked to her ear 
 She hear me cummin 
 Watchin me go, she swallowed cum, you kissed the hoe 
 Tongue and lip ooh! man you really lickin' my ball 
 "Heard you fucked my baby mama last night?" 
 "Nigga, no." but she did bring me no seeds, sticks oh 
 I'm lyin' when come over cot lyin' in her draws 
 Nigga all off in her draws, and that's your baby mother 
 If it makes you feel better she's a good dick succkkker. 
 My job takes me outta town, all expense paid 
 Wakin' up with a hangover two thousand miles away 
 Its seems easy... weed, women, and wine 
 Four hours of sleep is all you get 
 Now its time to tally hoe to the show 
 "Ay yo yo let it go" 
 Bust through the door, rockin' dro and grab a hoe 
 And get back in the van with some titties in hand 
 Let her meet ur new friend who's willing to spend 
 The whole night, another flight, another gig, another city 
 Touchin on somebodys baby mama's titties 
 Niggas in the lobby, wonderin where their women are 
 Third floor having a lesbian bitch seminar 
 Can't get attached, I have a plane to catch 
 I wish I coulda hit that, but I'll be back 
 "Yo ain't no tellin' where I'm gonna be at, but you know... I gotta go" 
 Yeaa it's the game of the chili circuit 
 I might tendin in it 
 I'm paperchasin and rappin' but it ain't no symonym 
 My money ain't a game so I ain't worried bout winnin' it 
 I'm worried about makin' it, stackin it and spendin it 
 Ain't no pretending it don't make no world move 
 Same way you can't pretend my shit don't make ur girl groove 
 See god work in mysterious ways, but I don't 
 And the devil will make a deal wit yo ass, but I won't 
 Now you can have the cleanest paint job on ur truck 
 6 TVs, wood with leather seats stitched and tucked 
 The biggest chrome rims playa I don't give a fuck 
 If I holla at ur bitch, guaranteed she gettin' fucked 
 You can yell and you can scream, and you can fuss and you can fight 
 Like it's the worst night of your life 
 To me its just another night 
 I ain't carin bout ur drama, or breakin up ur home 
 You just a joke for the crew and material for a song mayne
