Still spinnin' off last year 
 My dear, get more pussy than a past meal 
 Bitch I'm balling with my club like Paul Pearce 
 Black folded 
 Fade away shot pear 
 I'm still flying off the flow lear 
 Matter of fact I'm flying off to say hi to Ilyr 
 What I sail doesn't come with a beatle 
 That kind of slurp doesn't come with your meal 
 Niggas sticking on plan 
 'Til I Glock a AK and start crushing this brand 
 I do work 
 I'm just tryin' to skate as fly as a king 
 You know dope boy don't give the time to plans 
 Work, niggas sticking on plan 
 'Til I Glock a AK and start crushing this brand 
 I do work, 
 I sail to work 
 I got work 
 I'm rich and got work 
 I'm praying for forgiveness, crime blood in my eyes 
 I'm trying do better, but somebody gotta die 
 Fuck your gun trick with the Mickey Mouse click 
 Aka 47's Mac 11, let's get her, bitch! 
 Counterfeit kick doors, hoes tied up with some duck 
 I stopped smoking weed, fuckin' go, light it up! 
 The movies and the money mean nothing to my men 
 Who disrespects me nigga, I leave him dead in some fuckin' woods 
 Hard work, but no skill, though 
 Never had an honest job for bill folds 
 Just a blog and a scale under some I'll folks 
 And we ain't kicking it, we ball, no feel though 
 Bust some heads over here, no deals hoe 
 Tell you "go and fuck yourself, no dildo" 
 Fuck your government, I probably never will vote 
 Nigga, Tony Montana, our hero 
 Niggas sticking on plan 
 'Til I Glock a AK and start crushing this brand 
 I do work 
 I'm just tryin' to stay as fly as a king 
 You know dope boy don't get retirement plans 
 Work, niggas sticking on plan 
 'Til I Glock a AK and start crushing this brand 
 I do work, 
 I sail to work 
 I got work 
 I'm rich and got work 
 Down South ain't been the same since the hurricane 
 Katrina! 
 Niggas lost in the cliffs and the everything 
 See the judge, give you time for squire cane 
 Thirty years for a kiss, not the fairest change 
 I'm free, but believe I feel their pain 
 So I got the big cover like Vera Wang 
 Full time trap nigga, probably never change 
 Got the rabid Crib McGyll suck the celophane 
 Dance hard like giraffe cock 
 80 tornados, been locked and got his ass popped 
 Both bloods, all skills, niggas keep it real 
 Pushing halla burden made over 2 bill 
 Our innocent skills, niggas out here dyin' 
 Women famous I pull which nigga dick they ridin' 
 Now I say reality shows 
 But in reality all bitches ain't nothing but hoes

 Niggas sticking on plan

 Dope boy don't get retirement plans 
 Work!
