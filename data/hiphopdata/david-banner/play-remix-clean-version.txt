 (Verse 1: David banner) 
 Touch on your body like you want some girl 
 Work it like your boy just bought you a pearl 
 I wanna see you run in the middle of the dance floor 
 Your man named Buck, what you think your finger made for 
 And Ima beat it on up 
 You get it wet enough, and I might lick it up 
 Lickey lickey lickey like a peppermint swirl 
 Work them hips 
 Run girl 
 Uh, I wanna see your legs shake 
 Take you to the crib, we can jump till the bed breaks 
 Uh, we can jump till your body ache 
 Think about the type but right now, girl, mastur 
 (Uh uh) bate for you boy, freak you in the clubs 
 Stop worrying about them other hoes 
 It's me in your world 
 Work them hips 
 Run girl 
 (Verse 2: Kaine) 
 Hey how you doin' lil mama? lemme whisper in your ear 
 Tell you sumthing that you might like to hear 
 You got a sexy Lil body and your boodie look soft 
 Mind if I touch it? and see if its soft 
 Naw I'm jus playin' unless you say I can 
 And I'm known to be a real nasty man 
 And they say a closed mouth don't get work 
 So I don't mind asking for twork 
 You heard what I said, we need to make our way to the bed 
 So you can start getin it dead 
 You like to rub it, give it to me that frwaky stuff 
 Don't be holla at me if it get to rough 
 Switch the positions and ready to get down to business 
 So you can see what you've been missin' 
 You might had some but you never had none like this 
 Just wait till I show you this 
 (Verse 3: D-Roc) 
 You fine, but I ain't gone sweat ya 
 See I wanna toy with it, tell me what's up 
 Walk around the club with yo thumb in ya mouth 
 Mouth, mouth take your thumb out 
 There might be a lil kosher to deal with 
 Wet thang crunk up they don't spill it 
 I keep it really hot when I'm puttin' in work 
 Wanna skeet skeet you bout to get your feelin's hurt 
 'Cause I'll beat dat thang it's on 
 And knock da walls of a broad till she scrawl 
 Like (Ooh!) 
 Yeah something like that, but it depends on the swing of the baseball bat 
 Get some on da counter make the Plates fall Back 
 On the floor she ain't screamin she a but so it bread 
 Bread... bread 
 Wanna do it so good get it in bed 
 (Hook: David Banner & (D-roc in back round))
