Dreams is screaming demons hearing death whispers hello 
 My shell's strong, my soul's green lantern wearing yellow hello week 
 A hell week pledging for heaven state I got a knife to say tin 
 Swimming in hell's lake fire ire wiz saying calls within criss miss 
 My hood but of that, white man named Bill good and my sexing 
 It's like rumble telling sound wave it's time for my ejection 
 Obama want election but my folks still suffering 
 My friends popping pills but the thangs ain't buffering 
 Man it's hard for a pimp mama burped me from my ass instead of boy used to shit 
 But she squeezed before I dip but trip a small from a glitch 
 She said you feel me? Yeah I like your senses 
 Ma look up in fresh, time for me to do self 
 Like georges for the jerkin, I try suicide but the gun wouldn't work, bang 
 It's the same damn thang, the boys clubs whosing while they build the peer of change 
 Look at your pinky [?] the souls on the main 
 Yeah we really volunteered souls on the hand 
 But I'm from Mississippi where you let your nuts hanging 
 Where the white folks let my ass justice do the same, damn, damn, damn, damn.
