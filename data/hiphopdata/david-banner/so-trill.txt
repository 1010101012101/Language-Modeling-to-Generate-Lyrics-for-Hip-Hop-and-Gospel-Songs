 Song: So Trill 
 Album: Mississippi:The Album 
 Bread and water... This what it comes down to 
 I remember when these kids got killed up in Pearl 
 Is it the end of the world? Grown men acting like bitches 
 Bitches actin' like men, and it's all good 
 As long as all these records keep sellin' 
 Niggaz time cut so these snitches keep tellin' 
 Y'all know it ain't right... 
 And I ain't bending for these hoes 
 Is this the part when my God comes back and starts throwin' elbows? 
 Man these children gone astray, and no daddies in the home 
 So they turn to gun play, or they just turn gay 
 Half-bit like they rich broke, niggaz swisha sweet 
 So I sit, in a lac and just smoke, stayin' down in the street 
 Vernon Dixon? Georgetown in the hills 
 The subs and the boys in Hattiesburg so trill 
 The delta and coast, the queens is what I boast 
 But these kids in the south is what a nigga love the most 
 Damn, the kids is what a nigga loves most 
 Fuck, so trill... 
 I grab a pen and pad and try to tell you how I feel 
 And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill) 
 It's hard in the south when you try to stack a mill' 
 And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill) 
 I remember when the twin towers fell 
 Did the boys in the G know, or just didn't tell? 
 I ain't forgot about Gore, and them trick ass ballots 
 Numbers tossed around in the mix like a salad 
 Or a bird in the Bush 
 Or a brother up in office tryna give a big push 
 Y'all don't try to praise God now 
 He been watchin from the jump, I'ma crunk 
 Quick to pull the sawed pump, skull and bones y'all can kill me 
 I'ma G, and the world is gon' feel me 
 Bet you neva thought the truth would come straight from the middle of Mississippi 
 So P-Boy keep pushin'.. 
 We some big ones, life would street, man we all on a mission 
 I grab a pen and pad and try to tell you how I feel 
 And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill) 
 It's hard in the south when you try to stack a mill' 
 And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill) 
 This for my boys in the pen and my thugs on the county farms 
 If it's war then I swear I'm gonna raise them arms 
 And come and getcha, send me a kite... 
 And I promise that I'll write ya back or smoke a fat sack in ya name 
 I ain't no bitch or no hoe or no trick 
 Tryna ride a nigga dick just to make a quick hit 
 I ain't writin' love songs for prissy bitches 
 I make songs for the queens who lost sight in the hood 
 Mayne I made some bullshit but it's good 
 And if ya see me then you see this shit across my chest 
 I pray to God, let my spirit do the rest 
 I pray to God, let my spirit do the rest 
 (Hook until fade) 
 I grab a pen and pad and try to tell you how I feel 
 And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill) 
 It's hard in the south when you try to stack a mill' 
 And scream to the lord it's so trill (so trill)
