 Yeah 
 I see the fear in your eye, player 
 And we ain't worried 'bout these commentators 
 And we ain't worried 'bout no sack 
 Where your quarterback at? 
 Hes layin' on his back 
 And tell kamish that I'm trying to bring the pain 
 I'm trying to lead this thing with 5 Superbowl rings 
 I play this game like it's the last day of my life 
 I'm on defense playing I ain't trying to be nice

 They said we couldn't make it didn't have what it takes 
 So I think about that with every bone I break 
 Yeah We imprevent that's a fake 
 We switched it to a blitz make the quarter back shake 
 Yeah now he layin' on his face 
 50 more yards two minutes I can taste 
 The thrill of victory I won't let it get to me 
 If we stand tall right now we part of history
