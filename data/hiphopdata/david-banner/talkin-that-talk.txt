(Chamillionaire talking) 
 Hey! houston Texas (houston Texas). chamillionaire the mix tape messiah. 
 I feel like niggas need to show some respect off in here mayne. 
 Tell 'em the name, tell 'em the name. chamillitary mayne. 
 (Chamillionaire chorus) 
 I hear you talkin' that talk (that talk), I heard you was talkin' 'bout me ('bout me) 
 Soon as I ask who you talkin' to, you replyin with naw it's not me (not me) 
 No bite for all of that barkin (that bark), how mad that y'all done got me (got me) 
 They ain't keepin' it real like they talkin', pussy niggas is all that I see 
 (Chamillionaire verse one) 
 You could be hungry, ugly, chubby, homeless, crippled and blind 
 And still be better off then niggas talkin' lip to a nine 
 I hit that track with david banner talk that lip to me now 
 Pussy niggas like to hide, drop a bomb and surprise 
 Tired of lettin niggas ride, gave 'em to many times 
 I'm sick of tryin', sick 'em ??? flippin and flyin 
 Now they got me yellin' out what? like a skit from jon 
 Chamillitary ain't gon ride, y'all niggas quit ya lyin' 
 Cause you know that you falsifyin, niggas know they can't stop the giants 
 A shoulder to stop the cryin, move over this spot is mine 
 Takeover its about the time, time to put all these boys in line 
 You walkin' into my shoes, but you know you'll get dropped to tie em 
 (Chamillionaire chorus) 
 I hear you talkin' that talk (that talk), I heard you was talkin' 'bout me ('bout me) 
 Soon as I ask who you talkin' to, you replyin with naw it's not me (not me) 
 No bite for all of that barkin (that bark), how mad that y'all done got me (got me) 
 They ain't keepin' it real like they talkin', pussy niggas is all that I see 
 (David banner verse) 
 If it jumps off it jumps off, let the front of the pump talk 
 Sumthin that'll knock yo fuckin' lump off 
 Think I'm bammer think I'm country, well I am bitch 
 And I gout bullets I can share, and I ain't selfish 
 Baby boy I got just what you need, them slugs that'll fly through trees 
 And knock off kness, knock off ears 
 Knock off peers, got beats that'll knock by see us 
 Roll up, get ya throat cut 
 Catch a buck fifth, watch yo chest lift 
 Dope rhymes, cause the small eyes take a smith 
 Bitch I'm tryin' to make yo nose bleed 
 Like russians rushin the shit outta apollo creed, ima ride 
 (Chamillionaire chorus) 
 I hear you talkin' that talk (that talk), I heard you was talkin' 'bout me ('bout me) 
 Soon as I ask who you talkin' to, you replyin with naw it's not me (not me) 
 No bite for all of that barkin (that bark), how mad that y'all done got me (got me) 
 They ain't keepin' it real like they talkin', pussy niggas is all that I see 
 (Chamillionaire verse two) 
 Betta respest the messiah, hey where the hell is your manners man 
 Knock you off of yo henges, like you got hit with a battle ram 
 You'd be stupid for challengin, knock you out of yo skeleton 
 You be down on the floor like a lil flip or a banner fan 
 I hustle man, I hustle a grand like dude at atlantic 
 Then what I do with it, flip it kinda like that do that he mad at 
 The talkin' stops when a rocket is sendin you out the planet 
 You'll be just timber-n-a-lake, like that dude pullin janet 
 That could get you shot or damaged, I bet that you cry or panic 
 That could get you cut beat the hell up, then goodbye advantage 
 Put your feet on the concrete, I hope that you got 'em planted 
 Now stand back so I can (blap), and make you lose alll your balance koopa 
 (Chamillionaire chorus) 
 I hear you talkin' that talk (that talk), I heard you was talkin' 'bout me ('bout me) 
 Soon as I ask who you talkin' to, you replyin with naw it's not me (not me) 
 No bite for all of that barkin (that bark), how mad that y'all done got me (got me) 
 They ain't keepin' it real like they talkin', pussy niggas is all that I see 
 (Chamillionaire talkin') 
 There you have it baby. I'm hearin y'all but y'all full of (that talk). 
 If you got sumthin to say ('bout me) don't say it behind my back come say it to my face. 
 If you feel you got sumthin to say ('bout me). hey banner (that bark) 
 Lets ride out mayne ('bout me). show some respect. 
 Tell 'em the name, tell 'em the name chamillitary mayne
