The same people in the year 1606 
 Enslaved black folks in the same of the crucifix 
 And gave us a Jesus with light blue eyes 
 Hell on earth but heaven in the skies 
 While they eat they pie now, 
 Native Americans got slaughtered layin' passed out 
 I wanna mash out, but I feel alone 
 African American, but Africa she ain't our home 
 Man listen they look at us as cotton pickers 
 They might as well 'cause we love to call ourselves niggas 
 And George Bush is apart of a bigger problem 
 All America loves hate they will never stop it 
 And every rapper that I see has a key but not a key to be free 
 If God is only one how could she be three 
 Maybe the key to hell lies in the trinity 
 There's no divinity in politics 
 I cop more chips if I call my mother a bitch 
 Or made a record like this 
 The greatest story every told 
 What if I said I didn't wanna tell stories no more 
 What if I wanted to tell the truth 
 We fucked up (fucked up)
