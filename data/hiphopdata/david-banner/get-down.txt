 By the time I hit the door, I saw hoes on the floor 
 Niggaz dressed in suits, trickin' all the damn hoes 
 Me, I'm a pimp, I ain't payin' for no sex 
 Man, I'd rather buy a car or a new Rolex 
 'Cause I got street paint, so hoes flock like birds 
 I got one hoe in range and one hoe in the surbs' 
 When I hit the club, I'ma be wit David Banner 
 A thug ass nigga wit bad table manners 
 We act bad my nigga, what is y'all sayin'? 
 Like when we walk up in the clubs, niggas hold there girls hands 
 'Cause the know we run trains, choo, choo all night 
 How could a girl leave me and be witch you all night? 
 But it's all right 'cause you know we don't kiss 
 Like Too Short said bitches, ain't shit 
 I tries to tell ya that most girls really freaks 
 And this how they gottta make there money every week 
 Real girls, get down on the flo', on the flo' 
 Real girls, get down on the flo', on the flo'

 Steppin' in the club, lookin' just like a pimp 
 We cash, so, were screamin' out

 Sisqo made you show your thong, bitch

 So girl, get on the flo', go and get it how you live 
 And make it so hot, hot and show your pussy lips
