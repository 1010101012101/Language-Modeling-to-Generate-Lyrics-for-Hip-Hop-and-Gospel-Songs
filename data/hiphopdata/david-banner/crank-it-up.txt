(David Banner - Intro) 
 It's bad, that I gotta take out my muthafuckin time 
 To get y'all punk bitches straight 
 First of all don't worry bout what the fuck I got bitch 
 Countin' my money like you a hoe 
 Real men don't worry bout what another nigga got (FUCK YOU!) 
 You punk ass bitch 
 Fuck em' Static 
 Ooh! 
 (Chorus - Static) Repeat 2x 
 We Ridin' (Big Bodies) 
 With (TV's) 
 V-12's (V-12's) 
 (S.U.V.'s) S.U.V.'s 
 Crank It Up (Whoop!, Whoop!) 
 Crank It Up (Whoop!, Whoop!) 
 Drank It Up, Girl let me spank it up 
 (Verse 1 - David Banner) 
 We got uh 
 Big cadillac 
 With yo bitch in the back 
 Hold my dick in her mouth 
 While I pack em' a stack 
 She gimme ya riches 
 While you yap bout yo gold 
 It's on my cars (Ha, Ha) 
 That bitch bought me a boat 
 See she bought me a car 
 And it's lookin' like yours 
 Only difference is my nigga, I got wood on the doors 
 I got wood on my wheel 
 And I'm bustin' my steel 
 I fucked yo main bitch 
 (Nigga) How does it feel? 
 (Verse 2 - David Banner) (Lady Singing) 
 Y'all talk shit while we still winning 
 She's on my dick 'cause my rims kept spinnin' 
 Then I bust up the block 
 The system that knocks 
 I keep fuckin' yo bitches, while y'all keep bitin' the pot 
 (Diamond in the back, the sunroof top) 
 (Pilled up my stocks, now I'm pissin' off the cops) 
 Fuck that sangin' my nigga 
 We can chop up them pigs 
 Man I'm ready for war, if any my niggaz get killed 
 (David Banner - Outro) 
 If ya ride around town in his truck 
 Put his keys in the air and crank it up 
 And if that boy got wood on the wheel 
 Grip that motherfucker tell me how it feel 
 Now Crank It Up (Repeat 5x) 
 Yeah!
