(Feat. Akon, Lil' Wayne and Snoop Dogg) 
 (2x) Chorus 
 I got a 9 mm 
 Ready to go off any minute 
 So you feel it 
 Because of the law I had to conseal it 
 If you fuck around you are make me revel it 
 (Lil wayne) Tool on deck 
 Why would I lie 
 Nigga youz a pussy 
 Hope you got 9 lives 
 I could hit a nigga wit the 9-9 times 
 Country ass boy 
 Country like Leanne rimes 
 Mississippi d-banner 
 And lil weezy anna (lilousiana) 
 Everybody got tools 
 So you will need a hammer 
 I'm a pill poppin' animal 
 Syrup sipping nigga 
 I'm so high you couldn't reach me wit a fucking antenna 
 Your fucking wit this man 
 You can be this man dinner 
 The 9 give me brains 
 But the AK add lever 
 The rapper is insane 
 Flowing like a mad river 
 Make your ass quiver 
 Like you nekkad at winter 
 Hollygrove honcho 
 Hard time giver 
 I'm a shark in the water 
 You just long john silver 
 I got a girl 
 You want to meet her 
 Her name is 9 milimeter 
 (2x) Chorus 
 (David banner) 
 If I got 9 slugs, 9 bullets gonna fly 
 If I got a red beam, 9 people gonna die 
 9 momma's gon cry, 9 spirits in the sky 
 9 preachers preachin, 9 sermons tellin' 9 lies 
 Cause each and every one of y'all 9 nigga's wasn't shit 
 I would of rather kept the 9 lugers in the ruger clips 
 The index finga slip I let the 9 spit 
 I lick 'em all like 18 tits on 9 chicks 
 I'm a suicide risk, 9 slits on each wrist 
 If I died 9 times, the next go arounds a bitch 
 And if I come back I throw 99 souls 
 And shove 9 inches of dick in 99 hoes y'all 
 (2x) Chorus 
 Snoop Dogg 
 Ima west coast original, Black John Wayne 
 Nigga here we from we like to pop that thing 
 (Hey) you better stop that main, 
 Fat mouth the dawg and imma pop (pop) bang 
 Kids wanna bust me, hoes wanna suck me 
 Nigga's wanna touch me, none of that trust me 
 I'm too slick to slide, never snitch I let it ride 
 I set aside, all my feelins when I'm killin', like a villain 
 Move quick like a cheetah, imma killa 
 I ain't here to lock up, I flash the heeta and then lock ya whole block up 
 Dip dop deeta, Banner turn the beat up, 
 Illa for realla my nilla deal another card 
 You niggas always actin' hard, 
 I keep a 9 mm in my waist and got two more in the car 
 Yeah you all bout to get so quit it, 
 Tryin' to conseal it you fuck around and make me reveal it so kill it skillet 
 Chorus until end
