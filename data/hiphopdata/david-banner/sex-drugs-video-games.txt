Look me in my eyes girl and say I never loved you 
 Pass God and mother, girl, I put nothin' above you 
 If my life existed then I really thought she was you 
 The way your friends talk shit they might as well be fuckin' you 
 I'd be lyin' if I said there was no pussy on the side 
 I'm alone in L.A., I was just tryna get by 
 I gave all I had but my soul and my manhood 
 You got selfish, now I'm thinkin' that you want that too 
 Under the spell of these witches 
 Don't die fuckin' lonely, fuckin' with them better bitches 
 They say I'm from the sin but they ain't got no men 
 Regardless of my fallacies, you and I were friends 
 Ha, I guess your mother got a wish 
 That I would my daughters feelin' like shit 
 I won't call no names but if it's all the same 
 Your mother and your friends control my video game (damn!) 
 Damn, I missed callin' your name 
 I guess the sex and the drugs control my video games 
 Sex, drugs and video games 
 But they'll control the instinct, nothing to our brain 
 They're playin' with the pain 
 But I think I'd rather die than be on TV tryna leave a fuckin' lie 
 They call it sex, drugs and video games 
 But they'll control the instinct, nothing to our brain 
 They're playin' with the pain 
 But I think I'd rather die than be on TV tryna leave a fuckin' lie 
 Sometimes I get high but should've turned state 
 Rumpa said they ballin' but these niggas getting raped 
 I know, 'cause I got it all on tape, you could view it all it ain't 
 Niggas publicizing hate like it's Carmen versus Drake 
 Yea, our soul is controlled by the music that we make 
 When a guy wanna be known for more than just plain 
 Let me say that I'm a tad bit embarrassed 
 That wife on stick is cool that these nigga off in Paris 
 But to Africa, a child's sake, burnin' out this song 
 I'm a nigga 'til I die 'cause I heard it in your song 
 Real hoes get down on the floor, I know 
 'Cause I bought your fuckin' CD and that picture told me so 
 Then I aks little buddy could I ever change his mind? 
 On the dime he said yea, if you can stop my folks from dyin' 
 Huh, could I ever change his mind? 
 He said yea, David Banner, if you could stop my folks from dyin' 
 And that's real 'cause y'all niggas keep kill 
 'Cause it's sex, drugs and video games 
 But they'll control the instinct, nothing to our brain 
 They're playin' with the pain 
 But I think I'd rather die than be on TV tryna leave a fuckin' lie 
 They call it sex, drugs and video games 
 But they'll control the instinct, nothing to our brain 
 They're playin' with the pain 
 But I think I'd rather die than be on TV tryna leave a fuckin' lie
