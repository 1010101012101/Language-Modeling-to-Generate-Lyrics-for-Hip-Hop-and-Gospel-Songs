Young rich and dangerous but not Kris Kross 
 Me I was just a running boy till I made it the boss 
 Got a lot on my plate breakfast, lunch and dinner 
 Call me dear on heart killer yeah bitch I'm a winner 
 On my block it's lil' kids pulling pistol's 
 In Iraq it's innocent kids dying from missiles 
 That's why I'm back and taking the title from those before me 
 Matthew Broadway can never see the day I reach glory 
 I know partitions is wishing that banner stop 
 But I'm ridin' with banana flow and hat cock 4 shots 
 To my cousin that's lock 
 Come back soon tome rest in peace to my rilla roc 
 I'm a affiliated hustler so keep ya talk to a minimum 
 Hate on me first class to ya grave I'm sending em 
 Give me the rock and I'ma run it back 
 To all my young niggas out thurr stugglin' I hope you make a jack 
 Where you at. 
 Back one more again it's Nate Dogg 
 One day I might stop but not now 
 My game to damn strong to be stopped 
 Got hoes every place that I stop 
 Got beef tell you what I'm goin' do 
 Call up David Banner and demolish ya crew 
 Man them laws looking for me man 
 Rob to Mississippi All The Way To St.Lou 
 Stressing bout to take 4 blunts to the head 
 Making a revolution listening to dead prez 
 He say, She say I don't curr what they said 
 Number 1 hustler said equip with the bread 
 IRS tripping so fuck the FEDS 
 Taking shit to these devils cut off my legs 
 Lord don't let 'em put me in my death bed 
 For my son, nieces and nephews life I plead 
 Sit drinking yak till my eyes get red 
 Pass me a clip I'm a magnum to the lead 
 I hope society will let my love spread 
 Cause my lil' cousin steadily thuggin' before they go I'm dead. 
 We take no shit from No nigga that's flossin
