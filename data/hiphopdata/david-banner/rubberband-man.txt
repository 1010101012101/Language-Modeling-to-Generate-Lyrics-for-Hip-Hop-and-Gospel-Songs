(David Banner) 
 Chorus) yo 
 Ay, who I'm is? 
 Rubber band man 
 Wild as the Taliban 
 9 in my right, 45 in my other hand 
 Ay, Who I'm is? 
 Call me trouble man, always in trouble, man 
 I-I-I Worth a couple hundred grand, Chevys, all colors man 
 Rubber band man, like a one man band 
 Treat these niggaz like tha Apollo, and I'm tha sandman 
 Tote a hundred grand canon in tha waistband 
 Lookin' fo' a sweet lick? well this is tha wrong place man 
 Seven time felon, what I care 'bout a case man? 
 I'm campaignin' to bury tha hate, so say yo' grace man 
 Ay, I don't talk behind a nigga back, I say it in his face 
 I'm a thoroughbred nigga, I don't fake and I don't hate 
 Check my resume nigga, my record's impeccable 
 Anywhere in tha A nigga how TIP is highly respectable 
 And tha M-I-A nigga I'm tryna keep it professional 
 'Cause all this tongue rastling finna have me snap'n, I'm tell'n you 
 From the bottom of tha Duval, Cakalacky to New York 
 And everybody show'n me love that's one to you all 
 Yeah, to all my Florida niggas, my Cakalacky niggas, my L.A niggas 
 And all the New Orleans 
 Call me trouble man, stayed in some trouble man 
 Some niggaz still hatin' on shawty so, they some suckas man 
 Got a couple fans that love to do nothing other than 
 Lick, suck, show no 'spect, but still I love 'em man 
 Dig it, lil' pimpin' got tha mind and the muscle 
 Stay down on his grind put tha crown on tha hustle 
 Ay, I could show ya how to juggle anything and make it double 
 Weed, blow, reel estate, liquor sto' wit' no trouble 
 Young cats is play'n today Marvin Gaye of my time 
 Tryna stay alive, live'n how I say in my rhymes 
 My cousin used to tell me, take this shit a day at a tyme 
 And told me Friday died, Sunday we a day in tha ground 
 I still smile 'cause somehow I know he see'n me now 
 And so I'm doing all my shows just like he in the crowd 
 Ay, throw ya lightas up for my cousin Toot, (Rest In Peace) 
 Aaliyah, Left Eye and Jam Master J! 
 Grand hustle man 
 Mo' hustles than hustle man 
 But why the rubber band? it representin' tha struggle man 
 My folk gon' trap, until they come up wit' another plan 
 Stack and crumble bread to get theyself off they momma land 
 Gangstas who been servin', since you was do'n tha run'n man 
 Went down, did 10, back 'round and rich again 
 That's why I'm young wit' tha soul of a ole man 
 I'm shell shocked, get shot slow ya roll man 
 Still ryde around with tha glock on patrol man 
 I ain't robbing, I'm just lookin' for that dro' man 
 For ma niggaz slangin blow, pimpin' hoes 
 Rollin' vogues, 24's 
 Let these other niggaz know
