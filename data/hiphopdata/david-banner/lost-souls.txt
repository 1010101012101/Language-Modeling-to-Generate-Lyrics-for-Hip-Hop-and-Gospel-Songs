I'd like to welcome y'all back to Mississippi, 
 Yeah, I missed y'all niggas. 
 I just want you to know (Yeah), God is for the thugs too.(Yeah) 
 This is for my thug niggas, all the pimps and the drug dealers, thieves and the motherfuckin killers. 
 The ones who ain't never had shit, that's why we get crunk in this bitch.

 Daddy in the pen, momma out suckin dick, 
 I ain't never had fam so I ride with my click. 
 Said I die for my click, jealous hoes die too, 
 I would have been a lawyer by the age of 22, 
 But I won't so I don't give a fuck about killing dudes. 
 I sell crack too, I will jack dudes, 
 I dropped out of school to buy my daughter some food. 
 And her momma don't live around here no more. 
 They took her life when they kicked in my door. 
 Yelling bitch where the dope, then blow, blow, blow 
 They thought I was a beast, tell the bitch look now, 
 Imma smoke my weed, Imma fuck me a hoe, 
 Imma want your dough, Imma kick your do', 
 Imma slap your hoe, Imma take your date, 
 When I think about the Lord I got to see one day. I'm sorry... 
 Imma get me a 'laq, Imma ride down ten, 
 Imma pray to the lord, I won't die in the pen. 
 Gotta serve for my sins, Imma serve me a cop, 
 I gotta watch my back for the fuckin' undercovers. 
 Yelling:Fuck the clips! Fuck the PD! Fuck em! Bitch 
 Imma come up to the crib, Imma flood my block, 
 Imma ride downtown, yelling fuck Trent Lott. 
 They done raped grandmama, they done took our land, 
 Now they wonder why a nigga don't give a hot damn, damn, damn...
