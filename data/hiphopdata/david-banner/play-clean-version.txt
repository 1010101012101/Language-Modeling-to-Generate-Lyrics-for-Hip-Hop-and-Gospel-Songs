 Touch on your body like you want some girl 
 Work it like your boy just bought you a pearl 
 I wanna see you run in the middle of the dance floor

 And Ima beat it on up

 Lickey lickey lickey like a peppermint swirl 
 Work them hips

 Take you to the crib, we can jump till the bed breaks

 Catch it in your mouth, like your last name Moss 
 Set a seat for your boy, then you run it on in

 Beat it like Mr.Calipark on the drum

 Work it, work it, work it, till you make that body cream 
 Move it to the right move the finger to the left 
 Work it all around till you run outta breath
