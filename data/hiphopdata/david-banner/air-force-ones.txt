 I said give me two pair 
 I need two pair 
 So I can get to stompin' in my air force ones 
 Stompin' in my air force ones 
 Nelly: 
 I like the all white high top straps with the gum bottom 
 There's somthin' about 'em that's dirty that's why I got 'em 
 I leave 'em strapped and laced and come up out 'em 
 The last person that touched 'em I been shot 'em 
 Kyjuan: 
 Now if you looked 
 And seen lime green Forces and kiwi 
 You couldn't get this color 
 (If) You had a personal genie 
 You now I keeps it hip-hop 
 My niggas flip flop 
 Yeah my Force Ones and tip-top 
 Now form a flip-flop 
 Ali: 
 I like the limited edition 
 The khaki and army green 
 Patent leather pin stripe you should see how I do the strings 
 Size twelve with the strap 
 Red and white with a cardinal cap 
 All flavors well it just depend on when and where I am at 
 Murphy Lee: 
 Don't get me 
 Don't get me wrong man 
 And Murphy lee ain't dumb, man 
 'Cause if the shoe is on the shelf you should have some, man 
 You can not sit up and tell me that you have none, man 
 You may not have three or four but you got one, man 
 Murphy Lee: 
 We up in footlocker 
 I'm looking like I need those 
 Ten and-a-half and if you got 'em give me two of those 
 I can tell she never seen Murphy Lee befo' 
 'Cause she just standin' thurr as if I'm shootin' free throws 
 I said excuse me miss I only wanna buy shoes 
 She said I love you Murph especially in the white and blue 
 I said the white and blue sound nice 
 Make it twice 
 And I signed her autograph 
 "Thanks for the advice" 
 Ali: 
 Yo, I keep it real, dirty 
 Dirty, you know how I do 
 Purple and gold with the Lakers 
 The Broncos the orange and blue 
 I like 'em floppy with ankle socks 
 Lows, mids, and high tops 
 With the clear sole, but it's tims and fat laces when it is cold 
 But when the winter go 
 And the hot summer flow 
 Then its back to the all purpose with them lil' dots in the toe 
 And nuttin' 
 Stoppin' this dough 
 That I'm spending fa' sho' 
 On them Nike Air Force N E behind the O 
 Kyjuan: 
 O K Li 
 I treat my shoe like my ride 
 Chrome on the fat laces and put wood on the inside 
 Spray candy on the swoosh 
 With the electric poofs 
 Fixin' put kit on the sole now I got a whiter shoe (ooh) 
 You see that low mid skittle purple poof, I'm drivin' 'em 
 (Kyjuan, were you getting them colors? Are you dyin' them?) 
 Ten is my size in them 
 No point in tyin' them 
 Ain't no point in tryin' these on 
 They know I'm buyin' 'em 
 Nelly: 
 Now don't nothing get the hype on first site like white on whites 
 Them three quarters... them lows, they all tyte 
 The only problem: they only good for one night 
 'Cause once you scuff 'em you fuck with your whole night 
 What's my basis? 
 The look on sto owner's faces 
 This kids outrageous hes buyin' 'em by the cases 
 'Cause once I cop 'em 
 I gut 'em and switch the laces 
 They all purpose, ya heard me, kinda like my datin's 
 Kyjuan: 
 I wore spurs at first 
 Now it's tape on them 
 Damn, when those come out? 
 So I write the date on them 
 These Louis Vaton Ones? 
 You gotta wait on them 
 I had to get 'em early so I spent mo' cake on thm 
 Murphy Lee: 
 Look I'm tryin' to keep it up like a one minute man 
 While Ali on the Kawasaki two head bands 
 Jewelry and all (Who Wilin'?) 
 Fish bowl in the mall (I got some fifteens...) 
 Security buyin' shoes and all 
 Nelly: 
 Now sometime I get 'em free 
 Sometime I gotta pay 
 Walk in the mall and they now what I'm 'bout to say 
 Gimme the black, and the platinum, and leather gray 
 Ones in the back and the pair you got on display 
 Ali: 
 Now in da boxes were I keep mine 
 You should peep mine 
 Maybe once or twice 
 But never three times 
 I'm just a sneaker pro 
 I love pumas and shell toes 
 But can't nothin' compare to a fresh, crispy, white pair of the
