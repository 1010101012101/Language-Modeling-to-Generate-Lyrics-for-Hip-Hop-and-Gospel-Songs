Yeah, DJ Clue 
 Lemme breathe 
 Everything 
 Ice he sees 
 Diamond rings 
 Whatever you want 
 I got it all 
 But I gotta let you know 
 Always watch 
 Out for those 
 Triflin friends 
 Tryna play the role 
 Next to me

 So I wana let you know 
 Never see me out with no ametures 
 We only need to see yours and managers 
 The ice bright from southern cali Canada 
 But you hater out here

 Ya pissed 'cause I'm on a speed boat 
 In maowi hanging

 Hoppin out in cali swangin 
 But its hard to find me though

 Lemme breathe 
 Everything

 Diamond rings 
 Whatever you want
