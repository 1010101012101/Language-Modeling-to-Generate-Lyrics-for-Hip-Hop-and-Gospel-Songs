Yo, everywhere I go 
 You screamin RJ 
 I don't know if they talkin' bout Ray j or me 
 Darkchild 
 Baby you don't know about me 
 'Cause if you did you wouldn't be 
 Acting 
 Like you are too good for me 
 When everybody knows my name 
 An everybodys callin you, crazy 
 Stop and think where you need to be 
 Gurl why do 
 You say that you don't want me 
 When you know you do 
 You frontin 
 When you know you wana make your move 
 Stop playin' and do 
 Baby anything you want with me 
 Its crazay 
 'Cause everywhere I go 
 They're screaming Ray J 
 Baby jus in case you didn't know 
 You know 
 That once you been with me 
 You never wana leave 
 Its crazay 
 Every shorty wants to be my 
 Babay 
 And baby jus in case you didn't know 
 You know 
 That once you been with me 
 You never wana leave 
 If I change my mind about you 
 Guaranteed there's one thing that 
 I won't do 
 That's give a second chance to you 
 So if your really checkin' for me 
 The time is now for you and I 
 To be 
 Together doin' things my way 
 Gurl if you could have this chance 
 You should come and take my hand 
 And stop the games 
 'Cause I know hte right things to do 
 Show you how our love could be 
 If you just believe in me 
 You'll see that I'm the one for you 
 Its crazay 
 'Cause everywhere I go 
 They're screaming Ray J 
 Baby jus in case you didn't know 
 You know 
 That once you been with me 
 You never wana leave 
 Its crazay 
 Every shorty wants to be my 
 Babay 
 And baby jus in case you didn't know 
 You know 
 That once you been with me 
 You never wana leave 
 Repeat 
 If you feel me and your thinkin' that I'm hot say 'hot' 
 An if you really diggin what I'm doin' don't say stop 
 Stop tryin' to make me feel that we can reach the top 
 Baby your gon let me know if we can make it -hot
