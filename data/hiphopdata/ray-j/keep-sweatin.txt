(Feat. Fat Joe) 
 Pullin up to the club 
 Six coke dealers in my truck 
 Slidin to the v.i room 
 Hypnotik is in my cup 
 Then I felt someone grab me 
 And say ain't you from cali 
 Then say welcome to miami 
 Yeah she was on me heavy 
 So I brushed up like wats up 
 So her jeans was tight as wat 
 I say next she made me step 
 Back a minute she was wet

 Tossed her up like makavelli 
 And yeah she was on me heavy

 Sweat drippin down her face 
 Took my mind to a different place 
 Club was kool 
 If I had my way yeah we'd be at my place 
 Krazzi how she was down 
 Looked at me and said lets bounce 
 Gt coupe in velour 
 Looked at her and said swell huh 
 Then we started to roll out 
 Almost to my crib and she's down 
 For wateva you know I'm down
