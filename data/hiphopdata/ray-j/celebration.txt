It's a celebration pop pop bottles 
 Do it big like the movie, that's the motto 
 Number one spot so the haters just follow 
 And every time my hands go up, I'm hearin' a 
 Round of applause, hearin' a round of applause 
 Hearin a round of applause, hearin' a 
 Clap clap, snap snap, encore bravo 
 Baby make a wish up on these flashing lights 
 It'll make it all come true tonight 
 Twelve in the mornin', hauntin' this club 
 Because they saw the ghost and the phantom pull up 
 And ladies if you single, we in the vip 
 I'm buying out the bar, baby drinks on me 
 Now they screamin (hello hello) 
 Tryna get physical, but we we tryna see how low can you go (hello hello) 
 Mama say no mo, your body just said it all (oh) 
 And my glass is raised, make a toast to gettin' money (oh) 
 This is how we play, now its time to celebrate 
 It's a celebration pop pop bottles 
 Do it big like the movie, that's the motto 
 Number one spot so the haters just follow 
 And every time my hands go up, I'm hearin' a 
 Round of applause, hearin' a round of applause 
 Hearin a round of applause, hearin' a 
 Clap clap, snap snap, encore bravo 
 Right about now we all leavin' 
 Shawty said it's a go with no breakin' 
 Tryna tryna take a pic with her phone 
 I said slow down she said baby I'm grown 
 Now she sayin' (hello hello) she workin me like a pro 
 Booty clap clappin bravo, now she sayin' (hello hello) 
 Then we hit the front door, now she singing like she on tour (oh) 
 And my glass is raised, make a toast to gettin' money (oh) 
 This is how we play, now its time to celebrate 
 It's a celebration pop pop bottles 
 Do it big like the movie, that's the motto 
 Number one spot so the haters just follow 
 And every time my hands go up, I'm hearin' a 
 Round of applause, hearin' a round of applause 
 Hearin a round of applause, hearin' a 
 Clap clap, snap snap, encore bravo 
 Baby make a wish up on these flashing lights

 Lookin' like I got mother nature on the pay role (ah) 
 It stay rainin' but luda keep shinin' 
 'Cause me and shak zu went half and bought a island (oh) 
 Chris cut half a milli for the watch 
 Whippin hunnit foot yachts up to fitty five knots (ok) 
 Ten years been payin' my dues hoes 
 Get it right, paper long as penelope cruz' nose (woo) 
 Ten and a half alligator boots 
 And tailor-made water repellent cashmere suits (ah) 
 He so booji all in the jacuzzi 
 Such a virgo and that's why he so chosey 
 I like her but I'm diggin' you too 
 Y'all can do me like a wishbone and break me in two (haha) 
 Come one and come all at a time 
 'Cause my bottle service look like an assembly line (ray) 
 It's a celebration pop pop bottles 
 Do it big like the movie, that's the motto 
 Number one spot so the haters just follow 
 And every time my hands go up, I'm hearin' a 
 Round of applause, hearin' a round of applause
