 Warren g verse 1: 
 Every now and then I feel a little about it, 
 The VIP get a little crowded, 
 You should see the piece with the diamonds inside it 
 It's so vibrant, platinum all around it 
 When I take flight, how can I stay grounded 
 Got the 2 6 pep boys been around it 
 Shawty wanna shake the spot like right now 
 5 cut a cranberry Saturn right now 
 Mama got back, pretty little thang 
 Kicked in the door with bullied out the game 
 PYT, pretty young thang 
 I told her cross over stop messin with the lames 
 Switchin 4 lanes like money ain't a thang
