Yeah yeah yeah 
 Talking: 
 I know we been here before girl 
 I promise it's the last time 
 I know we on this shit again 
 But we done come to far to stop or give up 
 And I know you think it's better to just to leave 
 And this is were we disagree 
 But I know I'm shooting with my words 
 'Cause I got only words 
 You know my actions are louder then what you heard 
 And I'm tired of this arguing 
 Can I wish for one last thing 
 That means the world to me 
 'Cause I know what we got 
 Even when you don't 
 We rock baby till the wheels fall off, feel me 
 It's real love & I still believe if I wish on one last thing 
 Last call, last kiss, baby just one last wish 
 Last wrong, last slip, baby just one last wish 
 Been through it all, fought through the pain 
 And our love is even stronger, girl we can do it again 
 So that's all, & that's it, baby just one last wish 
 Last wish 
 You trippin' right 
 Nawh, girl I'm sick and tired of deja vu 
 Cause here we are again at the top of our lungs 
 See we both know we love harder then we 
 Give each other chance to seee 
 And every time I see tears of hers 
 Tell me is it really worth 
 You crying me lying it's absurd 
 A better man is what imma be 
 So I wish for one last thing 
 And that's you and me 
 'Cause I know what we got 
 Even when you don't 
 We rock baby till the wheels fall off, feel me 
 It's real love & I still believe if I wish on one last thing 
 Last call, last kiss, baby just one last wish 
 Last wrong, last slip, baby just one last wish 
 Been through it all, fought through the pain 
 And our love is even stronger, girl we can do it again 
 So that's all, & that's it, baby just one last wish 
 Last wish 
 Damn, if I could just wish for one last thing 
 This is our last wish 
 We been here before 
 Got out of control then we let it fall 
 It's time that we pick it up and never have to sacrifice 
 This is our last wish 
 It's a new set up we can do it better 
 Me and you against the world take over together 
 And that's how real love should be 
 So baby 
 One last call, last kiss, baby just one last wish 
 Last wrong, last slip, baby just one last wish 
 Been through it all, fought through the pain 
 And our love is even stronger, girl we can do it again 
 So that's all, & that's it, baby just one last wish 
 Yeah
