 (Ray J) 
 Girl, you had everything 
 But you played around 
 Now look at you you're hurting 
 Cause you lost the only thing that made you happy 
 Now you really do regret it 'cause you're struggling 
 And now you wanna run back to me, baby 
 (Ray J) 
 'Cause I can love you (yes I can) 
 But now we are through 
 You made me change all the feelings I had for you 
 You wouldn't change you 
 You could have love so true 
 But you're the same and that's why I'm so cold baby 
 (Ray J) 
 Baby, you couldve had everything (you everything) 
 But you had to play with me (but you had to play with me) 
 Now you want to me back in my life (back in my life, baby) 
 You don't have to play with me (yeah, yeah) 
 Tryin' you to make believe (make believe) 
 Cause you know I don't need you in my life

 (Ray J) 
 You thought you had me 
 Cause everyday I told you just what I was feeling 
 So instead of you growing closer to me 
 See you flipped it all and took advantage of me 
 But now it's all caught up to you, baby 
 (Syn. Voice) 
 I betcha regret it dontcha 
 Shouldn't have tried to play me butcha 
 Read it from the script you tripped 
 You wish you were with me now 
 -Chorus over Bridge2- 3x
