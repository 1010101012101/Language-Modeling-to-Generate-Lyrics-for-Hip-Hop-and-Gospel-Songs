 Yeah yeah, yeah yeah 
 Neptunes, ahahaha 
 We got dirty in the brand new maitresse 
 I had you walk around with your thong on back with 
 I know you feel surprise just how long I last it 
 Tellin' on yo freeze and I'm a nasty basty 
 Yo, you know what I like? models and actresess 
 You know the wind just scream "He loves you not" 
 You know the wind just scream "Tire ass pass" 
 When I see ya at the beach and I be like "She hot" 
 Baby pause let me freeze the frame 
 Cause slide down my pour let me ease the pain 
 With the roll on the dubbies in the greasy Range 
 And don't a eight rex cox and play a range 
 And with that body ain't no tellin' what I do to ya 
 I have you moanin' while I'm growinin' 
 With that body I can hell but to do ya 
 In the mornin we be telephonin me 
 Show me the rulin me in the warmin me 
 While I show you the upper side where lonely brings 
 The ice rup on my neck make my body bling 
 Flippin how why you doin' things 
 So tell me what you doin' tonight 
 'Cause we can do it again yo you with it aiight 
 Be, I know you like it when I'm feelin' aiight 
 And tonight I'mma make you feel aiight

 It's been a long time since I put Kelis out 
 I've been in VA puttin' 100 grand beats out 
 Payin' for the all glass, south beach house 
 So you can see me gettin' head from the hottest piece out 
 Ex-dyke dominican say they feelin' men again 
 Ask to me do I wanna sin again so all my hood 
 They's screwin me y'all; watch yo heels girls 
 Don't scratch my Louis Vuitton 
 I deep dog ya, all day a man and when I'm in 
 I touch your chest your girls scream alien 
 She said she feindin for leaves so she can breathe 
 I don't smoke but girl I keep bomb ass weed 
 I change clothes the same hoes who's choppin mangos 
 Gotta pull out my chain slow cause man that thing glows 
 My house no they can't see their look vacancy 
 Virginia is my home of my niggas my ADT 
 See my two dogs dogg knees and therfore like like these 
 And you've never seen diamonds as bright like these 
 I don't visit Jacob my stuff he mailing us 
 So what you think you telling us 
 ---- ---- Is my lawyer so he can better be there 
 I shop in Beverly Hills so we can dress and we kill 
 Watch the E! channel and see how a rockstar live 
 Who's the next girl who wanna see this rockstar crib
