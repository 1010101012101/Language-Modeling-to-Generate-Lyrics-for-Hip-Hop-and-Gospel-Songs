Knockout, yeah, Ray J, Bobby Brackins, yeah 
 143--I'll make you yell it when we sexin' 
 143 is what you send me when we textin' 
 I ball, ba, ba, ball 
 And pop, pa, pop bub 
 I'm just looking for some love in the club 
 143 I la, la, la love you 
 143 I la, la, la love you 
 143 I la, la, la love you 
 143 I la, la, la love you 
 143 
 Ride with a stunna 
 You know that I'm winning 
 Headed to the top 
 I ball, no 9th inning 
 Pop bottles in the club 
 Yes, we can 
 I don't even care if you a lesbian 
 That just means we got some common interest 
 Spark my trees then I'll spark your interest 
 Okay 
 Let's pop some bubbly 
 Tell me you in love with me 
 No golf, but club with me; I'm big like double Ds 
 Poppin' in cities I ain't heard of 
 Let me see your titties 
 Baby, pull that shirt up 
 Lift that skirt up; got buns like a burger 
 Do the most, not the minimum 
 You not a wage worker 
 Call up your local station 
 If you hear this on the radio 
 I'm calling up Ray J thinking about the video 
 If we make a video, I'm a need a scene with dimes 
 In t-shirts that say 143 
 I got my video all on TV (wa' wa' what next, Bob?) 
 We gone drop the E.P. 
 Throwing dubs in the club at the dance club 
 Or at the strip club; it's 143 love 
 Or settle at a playa location 
 Made another hit for the radio station 
 143 to the cutie from the club 
 Stick shift love 143 so clutch 
 143 e e (aye what it do) 
 143 e e (aye what it do) 
 143 e e (aye what it do) 
 When you see me in the club, say I love you 
 My girl's a mack, mack, mack 
 Lambo's all black, black, black in the club 
 With stacks stacks stacks 
 143 stay it back back back 431 
 Sexy, can I fall in love? 
 Sexy, can I run the club? 
 143 ee girl I love you
