She got a one track mind 
 By day, all night 
 She just wanna make love to me 
 She tells me all the time and that's all all right 
 Because I like how she ride with me 
 Calls when she wakes, gives you space in your day 
 Might send a quick message, just to make sure I'm okay 
 And that's all real she cares how I feel 
 I Ain't mad at someday that loves me 
 So... imma keep you 
 I get stress out when every body else shows (shows) 
 I need you through the stress in habit get it, like the way you do me 
 I like knowing the way how she feels about me 
 That's why? she's wifey 
 I love that she keeps it one hundred 
 One hundred (x2) 
 I love that she keeps it one hundred 
 She's out shoppin' in london 
 I trust her, I don't worry about nothin' 
 She keep it 
 One hundred (x2) 
 I love that she keep it one hundred 
 It's not just physical play 
 Real talk everyday 
 We can have fun 
 Laying up at my place 
 When she dress up she got execellent taste 
 I love it when she take down, down to the lace 
 Louy Vitton on her feet 
 Rare breed on her leash 
 My girl only wears gucci when she sleeps 
 I-i-i love how she feels because that's how I feel 
 She ain't the only one keepin' it real 
 So... imma keep you
