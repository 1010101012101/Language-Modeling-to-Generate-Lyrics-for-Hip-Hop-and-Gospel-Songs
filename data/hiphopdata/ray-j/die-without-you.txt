Is it my turn to wish you were lying here 
 I tend to dream of you when I'm not sleeping 
 Is it my turn to fictionalize my world 
 Or even imagine your emtions to tell my self anything 
 Is it my turn to hold by your hands 
 Tell you I love and you not hear me 
 Is it my turn to totaly understand 
 To watch you walk out out of my life and not do a damn thing? 
 If I have to give away the feeling that I feel 
 If I have to sacrifce 
 Oh whatever baby whatever baby 
 If I have to take apart all that I am 
 Is there anything that I would not do 
 'Cause I'd die without you 
 Oh I apologize for all the things I've one 
 But now I'm under water and I'm drowing 
 Is it my trun to be the one to cry? 
 Isnt it amazing how some things just completely turn around 
 SO take every little piece of my heart 
 So take every little piece of my soul 
 So take every little piece of my mind 
 'Cause if you're gone... I'd die without you 
 Chorus out
