Good plan to be successful in the game 
 U need it 
 But liars, snakes and fake friends 
 U don't 
 Banking safe, stash your money 
 U need it 
 20 cars, 20 cribs, 20 kids 
 U don't 
 Get the power while you can 
 U nees it 
 Concieted wannabe body guards 
 U don't 
 'Cause man I dun seen the biggest niggas get beaten 
 But a artist get mugged, shot up and skunked 
 You should get a box of glocks 
 U might need it 
 But west automatics that jam 
 U don't 
 Streets smarts and a cool education 
 U need it 
 Ditching school 'n' getting laid and not paid 
 U don't 
 Ma- braveheart and down for whatever 
 U need it 
 But thinking like a coward being scared 
 U don't 
 You always run to your family when things get low 
 When your friends that was friends, isn't friends no more 
 U need it 
 U need it, U don't don't don't 
 A new way of living your life 
 U gon need it 
 The 19th hundred lifestyle 
 U don't 
 An attourney that'll get you out of problems 
 U need it 
 Â£ Strikes and 25 to life 
 U don't 
 Buy some things to make you happy 
 U need it 
 Buying too much 'n' going bankrupt 
 U don't 
 'Cause man I dun seen the biggest ballers (mistreated) 
 So broke they had 2 come ask me ?? 
 Got a good idea write it down 
 U need it 
 Wasting time gettin' loaded in the club 
 U don't 
 Listen up forget the luck man, make it for real and never will jus be about ice 
 Glistening up 
 Save a couple of bucks 
 U gon need it 
 But friends that set a day 'n' go to the mall man 
 U don't 
 I remember all the night I was off the ?? 
 Just think of how fast all my dogs was gone 
 Your own business to do business 
 U need it 
 But a boss that won't let you be creative 
 U don't 
 Place to get away and jus relax 
 U need it 
 Locked up for the petty crime you did 
 U don't 
 Something to get you going to feel good 
 U need it 
 Don't be stupid though, every drug 
 U don't 
 'Cause you don't wana be the next rich kid od-ing 
 I don't that's why I won't 
 Yo I stay working 
 Yo I get paid working 
 I can go to parties and still get laid working 
 Like car-cop and like R.Jerkins 
 With all the cars he needs 
 I no I don't 
 He be in the lab making hits 
 U need it 
 But wastin the talents that you got 
 U don't 
 It's funny how life jus changes on you 
 When your so-called friends become strangers to you 
 Chorus fade
