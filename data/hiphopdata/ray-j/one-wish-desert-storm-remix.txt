 Fabolous 
 (Ray j what it look like baby, this yo boy fabolouso, got clue on the track) 
 Yeah 
 I ain't the one to be wishing, 
 I'm one to be pushing, 
 The 600 edition, 
 Under the cushion of air, 
 I've been in the sea and I'm done with the fishin' I swear, 
 But you don't see honey your visions impaired, 
 Maybe it's 'cause I'm flashin' brightly, 
 And light the sky up like a flash of lighting, 
 I wish I knew a way, 
 That pushes you to stay, 
 We could play the white house like Bushes for a day

 Bbaabbby, 
 As of a mattter of fact I was the one who said I loved you first, 
 It was about 8 years ago, don't act like you don't know, 
 'Cause you know what I'm talking about we've been through this before, 
 We were sitting at home in your momma's living room, 'cause (momma's living room) 
 Remember how it goes, 
 I would call you on the phone, 
 Your mom said you we're home, 
 But we couldn't be alone, 
 See back then we we're in school, 
 And growing up I was a fool, 
 And I can't lie, I'm missing you, baby baby baby, 
 First one: I would create a heart changing love, 
 Second one: I'll take yours and fill it all up, 
 Third one oh 
 I'll be okay if I get one 
 If I had one wish, 
 We would be best friends, 
 Love would never end, 
 It would just begin, 
 If I had one wish, 
 You would be my boo, 
 Promise to love you, 
 Trust me I trust you, 
 If I had one wish, 
 We'd run away, 
 Making love all day, 
 Have us a baby, 
 If I had one wish, 
 I'll make you my whole life, 
 And you'd be my wife, 
 Make it right this time 
 If I had one wish, one wish, wish 
 (Desert storm)

 Now tell me is this the only way I can get you right back in, 
 If so then searching I'll go, then I can have you fo sho, 
 Then you'll be loving me, 
 Touching me, (uuh) 
 Holding me, (uuh) 
 Squeezing me, (uuh) 
 So girl don't keep saying to me (uuh) 
 What I'm feelin' (uuh) is make believe (uuh) 
 Got me drunk in the club with two - bad ladies and I'm acting a fool 
 But I can't lie I'm missing you baby baby baby, 
 First one: I would create a heart changing love, 
 Second one: stop from wild'n in the club, 
 Third one: oh, 
 Don't need alot of wishes, I'll be okay if I get one, 
 If I had one wish, (if I get one wish) 
 We would be best friends, 
 Love would never end, 
 It would just begin, 
 If I had one wish, 
 You would be my boo, 
 Promise to love you, 
 Trust me I trust you, 
 If I had one wish, (if I get one wish) 
 We'd run away, 
 Making love all day, 
 Have us a baby, 
 If I had one wish, 
 I'll make you my whole life, 
 And you'd be my wife, 
 Make right this time, 
 Lets pop a bottle to this, 
 Fabolous 
 I remember hoping I could bang 
 A girl who was holding like trina in the ass and oprah in the bank, 
 It never came true, 
 But I still came through, 
 With the benz coupe, 
 That's electric stove playing blue, 
 I wish you was in the leather seat on the right, 
 But I made a wrong turn by never treating you right, 
 And now, I'm wishing on a star, 
 I see what's here today, could be gone tomorrow, 
 Girl I was to0 busy chasing models in bikins, 
 Riding them drop top model lambourghini's, 
 Now you got me looking in a bottle for a genie, 
 Just to make a wish, 
 Give me a pretty girl that could make a dish, 
 Some angel hair pasta, with a steak and fish, 
 And I'll be yours 
 Girl I was running wild before, 
 Now you got me riding 'round playing Al B Sure, 
 If I had one wish,(shish) 
 We would be best friends, 
 Love would never end, 
 It would just begin, 
 If I had one wish, 
 You would be my boo, 
 Promise to love you, (promise to love ya) 
 Trust me I trust you, 
 If I had one wish, (one wish, yeah) 
 We'd run away, 
 Making love all day, 
 Have us a baby, (have us a baby) 
 If I had one wish, 
 I'll make you my whole life, 
 And you'd be my wife, 
 Make it right this time, lets pop a bottle to this, 
 One wish, one wish, one wish 
 One wish, one wish, remix 
 One wish, one wish, one wish remix
