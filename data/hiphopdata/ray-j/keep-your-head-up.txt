Whoa, I see you walking with your head down girl, 
 Come here, whoa, lemme lift your spirits up, aight. 
 I got something on my mind I wanna tell you. 
 Girl, when you down and when you out, you feeling low. 
 Keep your head up baby. 
 Girl, I can see 
 You've been going through some things 
 Walking head down 
 Cause you feel so much pain 
 Blaming yourself 
 When it ain't even that way 
 Girl, why can't you see 
 That it's time for a change 
 That's why I'm talking to you 
 I wanna show the way 
 You don't have to 
 Go through this one more day 
 You take control 
 You dunno how far you'll go 
 Girl, listen to me 
 I'm telling you good things 
 Do you understand me 
 I'm talking from my heart right now 
 Start doing things the right way 
 Please do it that way 
 No matter what the world say 
 Keep on doing your things 
 Sometimes it won't be easy 
 But girl I got a message for you 
 Keep your head up to the sky and I promise you 
 Promise you'll get by 
 Baby girl believe me 
 I know you're going through hard times, 
 But you don't have to cry 
 Just keep your head up high 
 Keep your head up to the sky (I promise you) 
 Promise you'll get by 
 Baby girl believe me, 
 When you're going through hard times 
 You don't have to cry 
 Just keep your head up high 
 I know it's hard to 
 To raise a kid on your own 
 I know it takes two 
 You didn't make him alone 
 But his daddy's gone, and we know daddy's dead wrong 
 But you gotta keep 
 Making those ends meet (yes, you do) 
 And girl I know, 
 You can do it by yourself 
 Even though sometimes 
 You feel like screaming for help 
 It won't be long till the hurt is gone 
 Girl I'm telling you, 
 See I know what to do. 
 Do you understand me 
 I'm singing this for you 
 Start doing things the right way. 
 Even though some times won't treat you good. 
 No matter what the world say 
 Keep on doing your things 
 Sometimes it won't be easy 
 But but I'm tellin' you this is what you gotta do 
 I know your buggin 
 'Cause your strugglin 
 Babygirl you can make it on your own 
 You so deserving of some good loving 
 But baby first you gotta get through the storm 
 An once it's over 
 And off you shoulders 
 We will see that a star is born 
 So girl believe me 
 When I say this 
 That you jus gotta keep up this all day long 
 Chorus Repeat 
 Whoa
