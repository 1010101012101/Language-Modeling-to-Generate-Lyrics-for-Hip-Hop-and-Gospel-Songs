(Feat. Lil Crazed) 
 If I had one wish 
 I'd go back to the town 
 To the date 
 To the minute 
 To the second 
 You were mine 
 Cause the love was there before 
 Bet it was blind... 
 God tell me why I lost my mind! 
 'Cause I must be crazy if I'm lettin' you leave 
 Sometimes love's got a price 
 So it won't set you free 
 I'm realizing now that we're just for the beat 
 I din' give it all now 
 Give the rest to me 
 Cause you were the best-YET thing to happen to me 
 Like Picasso with his first master piece 
 Tell me why I let you go, 
 Tell me why I need to know! 
 Why did I take you for granted? 
 I let it manage to damage the only thing standin' beside me 
 I find it 
 That I'll neva see a girl 
 That can whirl 
 Like the one I was eyein' 
 Realizin' 
 I'm cryin' at night, 
 All the time, 
 On the pillow 
 Why I'm lyin', 
 I'm lyin' 
 And I blame myself 'cause I was wrong 
 Headaches lead to heart break 
 And I'm taken it the hard way 
 Cause- it's- hard- to- get- used- to 
 Bein'- so- close 
 -Can't -shine- as- bright - from-that-far-away 
 See cupid, 
 He gave me a gift 
 But I'm stupid 
 Cause of what I did 
 But if you could for-give den dat-ed be it...
