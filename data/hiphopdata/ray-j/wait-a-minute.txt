Neptunes, tell me, Ray J, where you at, come on 
 I been workin' all day (and now it's on) 
 Pull up and don't pay (when the line is long) 
 Girls in the club (you wanna fuck) 
 Ice grillin' these thugs (I wanna thong) 
 Is it 'cause my shine (major ice) 
 I'm talkin' about blind ya (like Vegas lights) 
 Never on the scene (without my team) 
 Cali, sticky green (know what I mean) 
 It's on and poppin', the DJ's rockin' 
 Chickens is watchin', it's on tonight 
 You had a long day yo, but champagne by the caseload 
 Pockets full of pesos, it's on tonight 
 Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute) 
 Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute, hey, hey, hey) 
 Girl wait a minute 
 Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute) 
 Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute, hey, hey, hey) 
 Yo, you know the words (wait a minute) 
 I been workin' all day (and now it's on) 
 Pull up and don't pay (when the line is long) 
 Girls in the club (you wanna fuck) 
 Ice grillin' these thugs (I wanna thong) 
 Is it 'cause my shine (major ice) 
 I'm talkin' about blind ya (like Vegas lights) 
 Never on the scene (without my team) 
 Cali, sticky green (know what I mean) 
 So much you go through, only problems know you 
 Let's party like we supposed to, it's on tonight 
 There's not a righter way, you've had a tired day 
 Let's party the night away, it's on tonight 
 It's on and poppin', the DJ's rockin' 
 Chickens is watchin', it's on tonight 
 You had a long day yo, but champagne by the caseload 
 Pockets full of pesos, it's on tonight 
 Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute) 
 Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute, hey, hey, hey) 
 Girl wait a minute 
 Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute) 
 Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute, hey, hey, hey) 
 Girl wait a minute 
 Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute) 
 Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute, hey, hey, hey) 
 I twist the l-buddha 
 In the black jag cougar 
 You ain't feel nothin' 
 Until the ripper ray do ya 
 I know this I.D. kinda look fake to ya 
 But you know I'm constantly club rockin' and mink coppin' 
 Believe that, my team stay packed like greenbacks 
 And when that dro blows my lex seats lean back 
 And on short notice, I pull out the old lotuses 
 And show up at party icin' like big polar bears 
 From the land of women, sunny days, chrome spinnin' 
 Juice and ginnin', it's on tonight 
 If you feel you're number one, representin' where you're from 
 Sex, you're gettin' some, it's on tonight 
 Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute) 
 Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute, hey, hey, hey) 
 Girl wait a minute 
 Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute) 
 Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute, hey, hey, hey) 
 Girl wait a minute 
 Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute) 
 Oh wait a minute (oh wait a minute, hey, hey, hey)
