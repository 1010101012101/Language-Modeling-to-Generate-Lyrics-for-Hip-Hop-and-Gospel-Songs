(Beat) 
 Yeah welcome to my life (raydiation) 
 City of carson that's where I grew up (yeah) 
 That's where I knew of (the view) that's all I knew of (yeah) 
 In kindegarten until I got out of skoo I started to hang with the fools I went from here to bad news. 
 Then ma sister started to blow up I saw the money just go up but I hardly saw her and my mother I used to 
 Hang round the corner I felt like I was a loner but I got love for my homies 
 I started changin flirtin with gang bangin' had the hook up on ol' skoo so everyday I was out hangin' and 
 Then I heard gun shots they aimin at my head and that's when the fun stopped 'cause next I might be dead i 
 Called my mama on the phone said this is your son I need some help I'm in a whole lot of trouble and can't 
 Get through by myself they shot out a plane and flew me out no doubt I said goodbye to my friends then 
 Disappeared in the clouds they told me ray j you gotta turn yourself around now or throw it all away and 
 Lay six feet in the ground 
 I'm totally focused I gotta move forward I hear my callin this time I just wont ignore it into the future 
 Throw all the past and then you came and you can grow...
