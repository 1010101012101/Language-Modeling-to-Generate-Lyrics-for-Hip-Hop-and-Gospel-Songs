If I told you why, why, why 
 I'd probably lie, lie, lie 
 Can't stand to see you cry, cry, cry 
 All I know is I'll be hurting you if I told you the truth 
 That's why I lie, lie, lie 
 You'd got me thinking my, my, my 
 And it's killing me inside oh 
 I don't want you saying bye, bye, bye 
 Don't understand can't explain what it is 
 That's causing me to, feel the need to explore any more, I have you 
 But when I do there's no truth baby all I do is lie 
 The only truth is that lie 
 'Cause I need you in my life 
 I don't always want you to know where I'm going to oh oh 
 So I sneak out the best way I can for a rendezvous whoa, I've lied enough to know who I can, and can not fool 
 So I cross my heart, swear it's true 
 That I'm loving you whoa 
 I'm doing what I gotta do to keep you 
 There's one thing I swear it's true 
 I don't know what I'd do if I was eva to lose you 
 Please baby believe me 
 And tell me that you'd neva eva leave me 
 I just don't want to you hear you say good bye 
 Oh, oh, oh, oh 
 Hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, oh, oh 
 Whoaaaoh, oh, oh, oh hey, hey, hey, hey 
 Oh, oh, oh
