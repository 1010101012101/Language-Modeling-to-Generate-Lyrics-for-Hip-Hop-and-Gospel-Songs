(Feat. Snoop Dogg) 
 [Snoop:] smokin' smokin' smokin' 
 Smokin' Smokin' Weed 
 Havin' a party (Bring the weed) 
 I'ma invite her 
 I got my lighter (Got a blunt) 
 I'm gettin' higher 
 Smokin' smokin' weed 
 Snoop: 
 Jumped out my bed and I head downstairs 
 Wiped the boogers out my eyes 
 Put some braids in my hair 
 Grabbed my favorite toothbrush 
 And then some crest 
 Rinse my mouth out 
 Now I'm ready for the rest 
 Break it down, roll it up 
 Pass if you had enough 
 You with the big boss dogg 
 So gon and puff puff 
 Real talk 
 Can you still walk 
 Have a seat 
 Have a drink 
 Now rest your feet 
 See that's the problem 
 You think that you can go with me 
 Smokin' cest your whole life 
 Now you wanna blow wit me 
 Go to the store with me 
 And get some swishy sweet 
 And grab a bite to eat 
 Before you fall out 
 I'ma ball out 
 And everday 
 We gon smoke until we all out 
 And that's a promise 'cause 
 We got the bombest bud 
 And you can ask Ray J 
 He know what time it was 
 (Smokin' smokin' weed) 
 In the cadillac 
 With my head back 
 Feelin' real good 
 'Cause it's like that 
 Another 20 sac 
 We got plenty that 
 We keep doin' that 
 Smokin' smokin' weed 
 (La la la la la la la...) 
 Smokin' on these trees 
 Keeps me at ease 
 With these 
 Crazy things I see 
 Smokin' on these trees 
 Keeps me iit seems 
 And I don't just where I'd be 
 Smokin' Weed! 
 Smokin' Smokin' Weed 
 Havin' a party (Bring the weed) 
 I'ma invite her 
 I got my lighter (Got a blunt) 
 I'm gettin' higher 
 Wish you would pass it (guess I'll wait) 
 I'm right beside her 
 I got an ashtray (at my place) 
 Where did my pipe go? 
 Shortymack: 
 So what you got nigga? (knockout) 
 I got the cush and the yerp 
 Packaged in Ps to keep the feds of my chirp 
 Uh 'cause my nerves on alert 
 Paranoid like your boy cookin up the work 
 (Smokin' smokin' weed) 
 Look pimpin' I ain't touchin that dirt 
 I ain't smokin' that shit 
 It make your whole head hurt 
 I got the card for the cataract 
 Doctor say it's legal 
 To twist up green 
 Call it Philadel eagle (shortymack) 
 Knockout pays me my check 
 Silver haze blowin' out the lambourghini air vents 
 I got the blunts and a pound of leaves 
 I been the purp man plus I got that OG 
 Ray J: 
 (I wanna) 
 Roll it, roll it 
 Twist that, twist that 
 (I wanna) 
 Fire it up 
 Then get that, get that 
 (I wanna) 
 Pass it around 
 Get bent back bent back 
 Give it back to me! 
 Slim Thug: 
 (Slim Thugga Muh Fugga) 
 Blaze in the bush of that cush 
 You gotta pull hard then push 
 I blow dro but to each his own 
 And I keep shit fit like Cheech and Chong 
 We can be outta town 
 We can be at home 
 I keep a good connect for that Cali grown 
 Weed so strong you can smell it through the sac 
 Its in the backpack in the trunk of the 'lac 
 It's a buck that's a fact 
 Won't accept nothin' less 
 So you can smoke alone 
 On your sack of stress (yes) 
 Pass the cush 
 Lemme hit that next 
 Slim thugga muh fugga 
 I smoke the best 
 Ha ha it's your boy Ray J 
 You know what? I'ma roll up one right now 
 And celebrate a lil bit 
 You know Raydiation in stores right now 
 Y'all go get it 
 Shortymack comin' real soon 
 It's about to get ugly 
 (Fade out)
