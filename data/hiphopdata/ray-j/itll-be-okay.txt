(Feat. whitney houston) 
 Take a good look and look what you see, 
 Day after day and night after week 
 See people dyin', innocently, it mite happen to b one of ur family 
 Now you stuck in the streets and you can't eat or sleep 
 N wen it seems like ur fallin', get back on your feet yeee 
 Gotta pick up the pieces, put ya life back together 
 Send me sum luvin, take away all my pain 
 Bring me sum fortune, just enuff to maintain 
 I'm lost on a mission, show me the way 
 I'm stuck in the system, so all I can do is pray 
 I pray, it'll b okay, it'll b okay, it'll b okay, it'll b okay 
 But it ain't okay nowww, I just wanna take a break now, 
 Don't put me in water I'll drown, I try to stay up but I'm downn 
 Focus on life and wut it rele means 
 Hold ur family and friends and wuts ur hopes and ur dreams 
 Is it worth all the pain, going through all these things 
 Wen thers nothin' to gain but you hav ur whole life to lead 
 Wen they say you can't make it you gotta prove them wrong 
 'Cause they always keep hatin' that's why I'm singin' this song 
 Gotta pick up the pieces, put ya life back together 
 Send me sum luvin, take away all my pain 
 Bring me sum fortune, just enuff to maintain 
 I'm lost on a mission, show me the way 
 I'm stuck in the system, so all I can do is pray 
 I pray, it'll b okay, it'll b okay, it'll b okay, it'll b okay 
 But it ain't okay nowww, I just wanna take a break now, 
 Don't put me in water I'll drown, I try to stay up but I'm downn 
 Whoa lord ur hearin me call ur name, my mind feels like its insane 
 And my lifes going down the drain 
 Whoa lord ur hearin me call ur name, my mind feels like its insane 
 And my lifes going down the drain 
 (Chorus: till end)
