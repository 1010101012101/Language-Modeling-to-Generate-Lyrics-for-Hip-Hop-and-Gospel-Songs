Dang gurl, got me hooked, 
 Wha you thinkin' about leavin' 
 What what, u goin' away

 Where do we go from here 
 You say you like my kissin' 'n' my huggin 
 You say you like the way that I be thuggin'

 Feel like your apart of me 
 And if you really wana know 
 Jus how far love can go 
 But first you gotta prove 'n' show 
 An what I wana know is

 You tellin' me your gonna be leavin' 
 (Wait a minute)

 Please tell me I'm dreamin' 
 But I really want you to know 
 That I never felt like this before 
 So don't leave me in a world so cold 
 'Cause it will be without you
