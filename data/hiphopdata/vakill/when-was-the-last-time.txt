(Intro Scene) 
 "Chicago!" 
 (Vakill - Verse 1) 
 I breathe through the pain and exhale for, single parent homes 
 Exhale crack addict withdrawls they can't bear alone 
 Exhale smoke from the barrels of those bearin' chrome 
 Exhale for the slums where angels went there to roam 
 Wrote my first verse in a book of Tops 
 That rolled the weed that had the crooked cops tryna book my pops 
 He lived in a bottle, when he drank, I shook the spot 
 Wrote 3 16s for every time he took a shot 
 Took it as a sign of confirmation 
 When Will's brains was blown on the safe, couldn't find the combination 
 Minor confrontations no longer pugilistic 
 We resolved 'em with the hugest biscuits 
 Understand - I seen too much not to address it 
 Held the tools that you got you undressin' 
 And I would exhale jewels and spot you this blessin' 
 Now, take a deep breath, be honest with yourself, and exhale when I drop you this question - 
 (Hook - Repeat x 2) 
 When was the last time you breathed 
 Walked the streets without a vest and gat tucked in the sleeve 
 When was the last time you [exhale] 
 Without the assist of alcohol or twistin' up leaves 
 (Vakill - Verse 2) 
 This is season tickets to my pain, I invite you ingraduly 
 Show me a hero, and I'll, write you a tragedy 
 If there's bullet wounds, I'ma [??] right through it's cavity 
 Insightful and avidly up close and personal 
 I don't draw pictures - I texturize the paint 
 To touch souls of soldiers next to risin' rank 
 That's findin' it difficult to exercise restraint 
 'Cause when it comes to whips, women, and extra pies, we can't 
 Die broke, that's some of our fears 
 Every summer y'all hear shells drops 
 'Cause cats makin' sure they numbers are here 
 When there's a hood, there's a struggle 
 There with knuckles and gats, settle my several scuffles in an appropriate manner 
 And if Soviet hammers, won't hestitate 
 Patience is a virtue, that can six feet dirt you 
 And have your spirit leavin' Earth, and what's even worse? 
 A lot stop breathin' before they mastered breathin' first 
 (Vakill - Verse 3) 
 It goes one for Ken's kite, two for twin light-skinned dykes 
 Three for T-Max with white pinstripes 
 Wish I could send 'em, Lord knows what your life's been like 
 Five years in the beast with no ray of light in sight 
 But I'ma ride till the Good Lord put it in neutral 
 Keep extra clips fuller than usual 
 Cocksuckas that wanna pull it and shoot you 
 I'ma put a bullet in mutual, Channel 32 Fox bulletin news you 
 Speak to Marilyn Manson, crack is viable 
 Where atheists and Baptists rival 
 Home of evangelists and black disciples 
 And two-time felons that's quick to carjack you with an ROTC practice rifle 
 Change the game, same rules to ref use 
 So F you, I refuse to leave until the impact I left's huge 
 This here's a redneck incestuous flow - son of your nephews
