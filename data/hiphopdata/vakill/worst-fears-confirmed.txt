Uh, V to the Izza 
 Chicago, we on the map now 
 A lot of new faces in the game 
 Looks like it's about our time 
 Some of y'all getting ahead of y'all selves 
 Fronting like y'all kings 
 I respect what y'all doing but 
 I air all y'all the fuck out 
 From the eye (?) of the violent storm, darkest cloud on a funnel mission 
 With slugs that travel through barrels with tunnel vision (whoa) 
 Clips too extensive, spit too offensive 
 From the Chi, love don't live here no more, rent too expensive 
 Push weight in a sentence, tell them not to wait on my sentence 
 Am I God's personally weapon of mass destruction or Satan's apprentice? 
 Nice, but I'm hating repentance 
 Coca-Cola killer; twist your shit, leave a prize under every cap, no blatant resentments 
 Look, let the drama come, I'm bent on having it 
 The crowd don't move, whoever intends on grabbing it 
 Is fighting off full blown AIDS with Flintstone tablets 
 Whether niggas feel me or not, regardless (bow) 
 Heartless (bow), spit in front of the hardest (crowd) 
 If they start booing, I'm sticking fans Artest style 
 Recognize bitch, the darkest cloud 
 Motherfuckers, I'm back 
 Guess who's back in this bitch again, full term 
 Yup, your worst fears confirmed 
 You better learn 
 The crowd don't move, wait your turn 
 What else can I si-say?

 (V to the Izza) 
 More ray shitting (?), I'm an asshole with a built-in sniper lens 
 Your top ten rappers top ten got no type of wins 
 I've been nasty sense birth, fuck a jersey 
 The hall of fame retired a couple of my shitty diapers then 
 The truth is my (?) umbilical was chopped from the naval 
 Darkest Cloud didn't go pop but I'm stable 
 Never been dropped from my label 
 I gauged my career to a fat bitch at a buffet and brought a lot to the table 
 The game's less diverse 
 So fuck peace until it left my curse 
 And rookies claiming they the best since BIG's death, that's (?) worst 
 Bitch please, you have yet to spit some shit that could fuck with a Left Eye verse 
 I'm sonning, as long as the one in the sky hung 
 They say the good die young 
 Mostly over bullshit and women that's high-strung 
 But them same bitches throwing me the pussy like they (? ... ?) 
 Guess who's back in this bitch again, full term

 The crowd don't move, wait your turn

 I hold it down for my niggas that's spending they last days in the country 
 And the bitches that's spending them work laced in the brownies 
 For the niggas that's popped jest (?), I'm raising the bounty 
 Till your brains on your moms with the shell casings around me 
 That's real talk with real chalk on ya' 
 Resting in a twin glock coma, the flow is glaucoma 
 Who's seeing me now? 
 Out emceein' me now 
 I went in 106 shitting on the audience with AJ and Free in the crowd 
 And I ain't no fucking mix tape fake thug 
 You'd get AK slugs in that pussy shaped fake mug 
 And it's all right to the show the late greats love 
 But some of y'all riding dicks and don't know it like the date rape drug 
 Catch me with your little niece on the couch 
 Kick her out the house, no blouse, Caprise's on slouch (?) 
 I ain't fuck, I just poked at her throat like a Capri Sun pouch 
 Point blank: I'm a fucking problem, capiche? I'm out 
 And there it is
