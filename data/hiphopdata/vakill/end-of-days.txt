My rep defy injury 
 I set the standard of nice so high 
 Once I'm in Heaven, 144,000 are denied entry 
 Can it be candidly 
 Vakill single handedly amputated hip-hop from humanity 
 Till every emcees are Stan fan of me 
 Let the world catch sleep and it's curtains for the canopy 
 Every time light bulbs pop over my head 
 The roaches running across the dark walls of my sanity, so 
 You're stuck with two options 
 You can swallow your pride and hand me dap 
 Or watch your family clapped 
 Competitions like parking spots 
 Good ones hard to find, everything else is handicapped, homie 
 We vise versa, I'm a nice person 
 They only good for one nice line in every verse they invent 
 Lava ran through my saliva glands with the sole purpose 
 Of turning every hood to ash like the first day of lent 
 The Earth comatosed last time the king feuded 
 Bring units when mandibles sling fluid 
 Y'all can't be serious 
 Vakill's like Colombians sitting in a circle 
 My name has a dope ring to it 
 My reigns one step towards tomorrow 
 A new world order model flower 
 Spitting harder then a boxer with piss in his water bottle 
 The Second Coming 
 With a sperm count so high girls got to chew before they swallow 
 The end of the beginning is Kill 
 Dominion is mine 
 The world don't stop spinning until 
 Who should oppose? I'm bending his will 
 Put ten in his grill 
 (It's not a game) 
 The ending is real 
 The end of the beginning is Kill 
 Dominion is mine 
 The world don't stop spinning until 
 Who should oppose? I'm bending his will 
 Put ten in his grill 
 (It's not a game) 
 The ending is real 
 Some emcees I should have been blazed by now 
 Talking that front page murder 
 You couldn't make headlines with raised eyebrows 
 Traditional hip-hop is beating a dead horse 
 One mark[?] posted on the internet 
 Check your bed for its head when I send a threat 
 Cause hell hath no fury strict as mine 
 Yet disillusioned statements of hypocrisy are the sickest kind 
 It's like sign makers on strike 
 While holding them shits up in picket lines 
 Not everything that's abstract is coming from out the wood work 
 It's ill or deserve the skill 
 The underground circuit or circus's filled 
 With bodies of my meat hanging from trees 
 Like Blair Witch stick figures in Burkittsville 
 I'm above niggas with divinity, I spit the Trinity 
 So you up against trio odds and losing ain't a God or Ms. Cleo cards 
 The sickest emcees is beneath me 
 Snapping under my nuts like leotards 
 I'm [ ? ] and violentest [ ? ... ?] 
 [ ? ... ? ] With straight razors at your trachea 
 Half postal worker, half terrorist anthrax biochemist 
 I'm the sickest pushing the envelope, please 
 Born nice and dying nicest 
 Dionysus-like, I keep a hand full of ass and a wine cooler 
 Most quotable line ruler 
 In a class by myself like a bitched up tutor hiding from Columbine shooters 
 The end of the beginning is Kill 
 Dominion is mine 
 The world don't stop spinning until 
 Who should oppose? I'm bending his will 
 Put ten in his grill 
 (It's not a game) 
 The ending is real
