I pray to God for His blessing to consent slaughter 
 Your seven ounces of brain holds 2 percent water 
 Literately your dried idea belongs under your arm pits 
 Fully armed spit. My palms slick with this engraved 
 Vakill in quotation's the nicest 
 After I come fuck this liquid hell 
 Only hoes that's giving head is getting flotation devices 
 Digest words to kill by 
 Auto-pilot my technique so even if I sleep on my own shit it's still fly 
 I'm Gods only begotten renegade angel; saint-sinner 
 Make anemic hemorrhage, I can draw graphic scenic image with paint-thinner 
 Let the bullshit stop to a screech with hot lead 
 I beseech hip hop heads till the tooth brush is obsolete 
 Many fuck around and catch a reach flip top head 
 I set respectable trends 
 Till the sickest emcees blueprint my testicle skin 
 Don't worry if I write rhymes, I write checks to your chin 
 Bow down to an entity none of y'all nice than 
 Put your tool on safety and a mic in a mic stand 
 Your fight plans now's in Christ's hands 
 Cause the darkest cloud shall roam the rest of your natural lifespan 
 Bow down to an entity none of y'all nice than 
 Put your tool on safety and a mic in a mic stand 
 Your fight plans now's in Christ's hands 
 Cause the darkest cloud... 
 I'm voicing oral crucification with a mouth full of nine inch nails 
 Conceptually blazing in trails, with your skeletal remains and entrails 
 Impaled, snug and cushy 
 My hip-hop status is c-section (why?) 
 'Cause I'm a cut above you pussies 
 My DNA spliced with a Japanese feudal lord 
 Brutal sword lacerations with impartial rhymes 
 Keep a bitch that's a ten 
 Pimping's like Farrakhan with cerebral palsy, 
 I can start a million march of dimes 
 Significant sever uncertain signs salivating 
 Circles around cyphers of a venomous serpent kind 
 Dizzying bitches, merking niggas grizzly and vicious 
 Till they minus flesh and bone like Layzie, Krayzie, Bizzy, and Wish's 
 Who's the sickest shitting this year? 
 And your continuation of breathing all depends on how good's the answers 
 Fuck up and the judge will sentence me so many times 
 You'll have to indent this shit and put it in stanzas 
 Bow down to an entity none of y'all nice than 
 Put your tool on safety and a mic in a mic stand 
 Your fight plans now's in Christ's hands 
 Cause the darkest cloud shall roam the rest of your natural lifespan 
 Bow down to an entity none of y'all nice than 
 Put your tool on safety and a mic in a mic stand 
 Your fight plans now's in Christ's hands 
 Cause the darkest cloud... 
 I don't talk shit, I give shit a second language 
 You ass betting a dyslectic Spanglish 
 Hope for the best but expect the anguish 
 Presently, sleepers dying pissed off 
 And my sole solution for the chronic bed wetting is electric blankets 
 My diatribe merks entire tribes 
 I'm the 13th ghost from (?) 
 So when I make the alphabet perform Karma Sutra 
 The English language'll have to be stapled-stitched back together with stainless steel armored sutures 
 Drunken word techniques for (?) Tequila liqour 
 Shit bananas with a peel and a Chiquita sticker 
 (Heat a clip up?), puts kids to sleep 
 Spitting Korean entrepreneur flows that (push wigs to eat?) 
 Illuminous whip, darkest cloud cumulous (?...?) numerous clicks, cancer tumorous sick 
 Nickel, slick, quick, humorous spit 
 Liquid sword salivation till throats of every consumer is slit 
 Shit. In every recessive state my flows a regal spectacle 
 If I was born with one nut I'll still be ego-testicle 
 And niggas shit-popping more outstanding worth than weight 
 Can't hold a fucking candle to me with Bob Hope's birthday cake 
 I've enhanced the Jordan rules 
 Putting bodies on the mic and watch the fliest nigga leap to his death 
 If the name of my profession is "Fuck You" then basically what I'm trying to say is... 
 Never mind, my work speaks for itself 
 Bow down to an entity none of y'all nice than 
 Put your tool on safety and a mic in a mic stand 
 Your fight plans now's in Christ's hands 
 Cause the darkest cloud shall roam the rest of your natural lifespan 
 Bow down to an entity none of y'all nice than 
 Put your tool on safety and a mic in a mic stand 
 Your fight plans now's in Christ's hands 
 Cause the darkest cloud... 
 Bow down to an entity none of y'all nice than 
 Put your tool on safety and a mic in a mic stand 
 Your fight plans now's in Christ's hands 
 Cause the darkest cloud shall roam the rest of your natural lifespan 
 Bow down to an entity none of y'all nice than 
 Put your tool on safety and a mic in a mic stand 
 Your fight plans now's in Christ's hands 
 Cause the darkest cloud...
