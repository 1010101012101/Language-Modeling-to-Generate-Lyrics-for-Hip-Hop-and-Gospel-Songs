Mya: 
 Is it all right if I want to 
 Fall way way deep in love with you? 
 Would it be safe to say 
 That I'm well on my way-my way-my way 
 I'm scared as hell (yeah) 
 Know heartbreak all too well (yeah) 
 Just gimme a green light baby 
 Just say its okay 
 And To goin' (goin-goin') 
 Baby Can I (Yeah) Baby Can I (Yeah) 
 Baby Can I, Baby Can I 
 Can I tear these walls down now 
 Yeah, Yeah, Yeah 
 Can I tear these walls down now 
 Yeah, Yeah, Yeah 
 Can I tear these walls down now 
 Trina: 
 I miss you, do you miss us? It's so much shit we gotta discuss 
 When you think about me do you get stuck 
 'Cause when I think about you everything just 
 Reminds me of when we had our first Christmas 
 And I've been thinking we should talk about mistrust 
 Cause it cuts and that hurts, 
 If I could I would play it all backwards 
 If you say it then you can't take back words 
 My head pounds, my back hurts 
 When you're going no one really knows 
 But when you're lonely and feeling really cold 
 What that do? Exactly, the same thoughts just keep coming at me 
 You attract me, would that be? I'm not happy 
 Mya: 
 I'm scared as hell (yeah) 
 Know heartbreak all too well (yeah) 
 Just gimme a green light baby 
 Just say its okay 
 And To goin' (goin-goin') 
 Baby Can I (Yeah) Baby Can I (Yeah) 
 Baby Can I, Baby Can I 
 Can I tear these damn walls down now 
 Yeah, Yeah, Yeah 
 Can I tear these walls damn down now 
 Yeah, Yeah, Yeah 
 Can I tear these walls damn down now 
 Trina: 
 Love is danger, I never thought that I would share it with a stranger 
 On a mission really thinking I could change ya, and if I did was I ready for the change up 
 Wouldn't listen when he said remainder, be me, left there with my anger, 
 Mistake, went the wrong way I prepare to have another long day without you, I go in 
 I get mad, I throw things, temper tantrums, I want you, we can do it all again and I want 
 To, What that do? Exactly, the same thoughts just keep coming at me 
 You attract me, what that be? I'm not happy 
 Mya: 
 But I got these walls up 
 They've been here to protect me 
 You say you're all I need now 
 But I'm lookin' at you crazy 
 Cause the last time that I did this 
 Damn near lost my mind 
 And you say that I can do this, but really Can I? 
 Is it all right if I want to 
 Fall way way deep in love with you? 
 Would it be safe to say 
 That I'm well on my way-my way-my way 
 I'm scared as hell (yeah) 
 Know heartbreak all too well (yeah) 
 Just gimme a green light baby 
 Just say its okay 
 And I'm goin' (goin-goin')
