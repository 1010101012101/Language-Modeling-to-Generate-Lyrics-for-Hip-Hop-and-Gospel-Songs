This n*gga be just callin my phone 
 I be like why do you call me I never gave you my number first of all 
 I find it rude for you to call somebody 
 It's like I got ya number from your people, 
 Some people, but I was like well I didn't give you my number so you shouldn't call my phone... 
 Hold on 1 sec. baby... hello? 
 She left you all alone, so take my body home 
 I'm here to make ya moan (reach out, touch me) 
 Now feel some naked sweat bet it'll drip right down your neck, when I talk ya won't forget (reach out, touch me) 
 You want a hella chick lemme sign some other dick, you get the tip to lick n *ooh* (reach out, touch me) 
 Sit back 'n' close your eyes, don't try to take your time, it's gonna be a night 
 (Reach out, touch me) 
 I say G's feel ya ass up, me up on a plasma, is there anything better you can ask for? 
 Ain't nothin' sweeter than a diva named trina 
 Fresh to death like I live at the cleaners 
 I'm so sexy I could kiss myself 
 But why do it when I know that I could get some help 
 Yo take my number, let it marinate, don't even wonder how I turned a winter's night into summer 
 Ponder, in ya mind, this spot it 69, 
 I'll make sure you'll get yours now gimme mine 
 You know, holla at me, throw a thousand to a dolla at me 
 Gucci, miss sixty, to some prada at me (reach out, touch me) 
 Shower me with the finest things, diamond rings, tea cups, ?? and designer jeans 
 I got this call comin' in, I'll hit ya back 
 Be prepared to cross our lines that connect-picture that 
 She left you all alone, so take my body home 
 I'm here to make ya moan (reach out, touch me) 
 Now feel some naked sweat bet it'll drip right down your neck, when I talk ya won't forget (reach out, touch me) 
 You want a hella chick lemme sign some other dick, you get the tip to lick n *ooh* (reach out, touch me) 
 Sit back 'n' close your eyes, don't try to take your time, it's gonna be a night 
 (Reach out, touch me) 
 Can ya hear me nanna? 
 Ya hear me better? 
 Good, I'm ready to seva and down for whateva 
 I'd slid you my digits nah, come pay a visit 
 Your no ("man-chick"), that's just ready to handle business 
 Ooh my bedroom moans louder than ringtones 
 My sexy ninja have ya shoppin' at Queen's Home 
 My girls told me bout your line with a 3-way 
 But this curious cat don't wanna go off what 'she' say 
 So get over to room star 67 
 Where I block the haters and a playa get a piece of heaven 
 Lemme know when you downstairs in mike's kitchen, it's the playgirl's suite 
 Before I change my decision 
 Curve insturctions no disturbance when I nurse on you 
 Off the hook in a lawn waitin in my birthday suit 
 No dis when I give you my hand 
 I'm about to give the limit to plan-goddamn 
 She left you all alone, so take my body home 
 I'm here to make ya moan (reach out, touch me) 
 Now feel some naked sweat bet it'll drip right down your neck, when I talk ya won't forget (reach out, touch me) 
 You want a hella chick lemme sign some other dick, you get the tip to lick n *ooh* (reach out, touch me) 
 Sit back 'n' close your eyes, don't try to take your time, it's gonna be a night
