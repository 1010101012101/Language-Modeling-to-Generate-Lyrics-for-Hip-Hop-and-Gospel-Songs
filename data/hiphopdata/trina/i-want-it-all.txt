You must have it twisted or have a shortage 
 I ain't even empty handed, I beg your pardon 
 If I'm departing, I'm taking everything 
 'Cause I'll be damned if another bitch wore your last name 
 Put your hands up ladies if you want it all 
 Put your hands up ladies if you want it all 
 Put your hands up ladies if you want it all 
 Say, I want it all, say, I want it all 
 I want it all, I want it all 
 I want it all, I want it all 
 I want it all, I want it all 
 I want it all, I want it all 
 I went looking for your phone when I shouldn't have 
 'Cause I found just what I was looking for 
 A new number says it's Kelly 
 Should I call it or should I just ignore? 
 Now I'm sittin' here wondering when you're coming home 
 Then I thought about it everything that's going on 
 I gotta leave this relationship but I'm not leaving here 
 So let me get my list out 
 What do I want other than this house? 
 First of, let me put your bitch out 
 Call me crazy if you want her but I don't care 
 Now back to my list 
 Gotta have the house, check 
 Do I want the car, check? 
 Do I want the money, check? 
 Gotta have it all, check 
 And I deserve it, hope it was worth it 
 And I don't think that I'll be needing your service 
 I need his house, I need his car 
 And then the bank, I want it all 
 I gave you all my love and got nothing in return 
 So now I want it all, I want it all 
 Gimme the house, gimme the car 
 I want it all, I want it all 
 I want it all, I want it all 
 If I'm gonna have to hurt, you gonna feel it how I feel it 
 Play the cards how I deal it, you know I was the realist 
 'Cause the way you going 'bout this like I never meant shit 
 Now you want the other bitch 'cause we had an argument 
 Okay, roll the dice, I'ma show you how it go 
 And since you wanna do it dirty, watch this fire crack a blow 
 This ain't no tit for tat shit, it's all about the principle 
 How you expect to leave me without a comma or decimal? 
 Pay me for my pain, pay me for my time 
 Nigga, you can say the bullshit 'cause everything is mine 
 From the house in West Pond to the yacht in Burlese 
 You can keep your sad face, baby, hand me them keys 
 'Cause the shit you said it, did it, threw me way off track 
 But when a woman is fed up, no, it ain't no turning back 
 Only thing gonna make me smile is if I feel my satisfaction 
 Is seeing you hurt is fuckin', you suffering while I'm relaxing 
 So now I need his house, I need his cars 
 And then the bank, I want it all 
 I gave you all my love and got nothing in return 
 So now I want it all, I want it all 
 Gimme the house, I need the car 
 I want it all, I want it all, I want it all 
 Put your hands up ladies if you want it all 
 Put your hands up ladies if you want it all 
 Put your hands up ladies if you want it all 
 Say, I want it all, say, I want it all 
 I want it all, I want it all 
 I want it all, I want it all 
 I want it all, I want it all 
 I want it all, I want it all 
 I need his house, I need his car 
 And then the bank, I want it all 
 I want it, I want it, I earned it 
 You're a liar you're a cheater, gimme what I need 
 I'll leave you alone if you gimme what I please 
 Oh, I want it all, oh, be a man about it 
 Put your hands up ladies if you want it all 
 Put your hands up ladies if you want it all 
 Put your hands up ladies if you want it all 
 Say, I want it all, say, I want it all 
 I want it all
