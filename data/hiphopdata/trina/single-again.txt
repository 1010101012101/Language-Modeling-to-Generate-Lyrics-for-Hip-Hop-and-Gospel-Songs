 Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya

 I'm single again, 
 Back on the prowl, 
 I thought it was perfect, 
 I don't know how, 
 I'm single again, 
 Back on the prowl,

 And never will you find another bitch like me, 
 And I don't care what your friends say 
 What we had was like jay and beyonce, 
 Or was it all a dream, 
 Backseat in the phatom, 
 Sippin that lee, 
 We party like rockstars, 
 We sex like pornstars, 
 I sing to a million bars.

 If you find watcha lookin' for back under my pit, 
 Lets agree to disagree, 
 Don't explain shit to me,

 There's nobody, 
 I need I need I need my own space, 
 I'm single again, 
 Whos who I'm minglin wit, 
 Ball players wit the seat the game, 
 Ring size still doin' my thing, 
 Changed my number, 
 Switched my cars up, 
 6 months since you messed your cars up, 
 It all started so promising, 
 Got my own diamonds, 
 Got my own damn promise ring. 
 I'm single again,

 Hold up, 
 Wait a god damn minute, 
 It ain't over till I say we finished, 
 Till I get my half, 
 Then I sit back, relax, and just laugh, 
 At the times we shared like flying over a B-More high in the G-4 
 Smokin' on cali bud, 
 That's how real G's show a bitch cali love, 
 Sex in the cop pit, 
 No love I was just another object, 
 You fell in love for my ass, 
 King magazine you fell in love for my ass, 
 20 g's in the prada bags, 
 And I'm bout to fall out, 
 Had to get my mind right, 
 I'm back in the limelight, 
 Like fellas!
