Da bitch is back 
 I say da bitch is back 
 Yeah da bitch is back (I got da keys I'm fen to drive come on let's ride) 
 Back seat Phantom 
 Dark tents rolled down 
 Didn't want to see her look at me now 
 Say she couldn't rap but I'm still here standing 
 The baddest bitch is what the fuck they yelling 
 She's not real 
 That one's fack 
 I step in da booth kill a track one take 
 Trina one break I'm so heavy weight 
 Look at the map, I'm from the gun shake state 
 Don't ne bitch want it 
 Bitch tighten up 
 Only bitch with a deal 
 Slip 'n' slide what 
 Swam across the Atlantic, back stroked back 
 Just mark my words I'm a take that back 
 Gon burn des charts 
 Stack ev'ry lock 
 Gon grace ev'ry cover 
 Dis bitch here hot 
 To give you all a lesson 
 Let me put it on the dresser 
 Where I put my damn shoes I will not lose 
 Y'all gon learn to respect the queen yestrday it was all a dream [x2] 
 I'm still da baddest bitch ah [x2]
