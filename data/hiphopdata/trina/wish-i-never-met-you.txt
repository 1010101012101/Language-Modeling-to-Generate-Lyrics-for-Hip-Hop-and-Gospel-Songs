 I wish I never met you boy 
 And its killing me to know that I can't have you in my world. 
 I wish I never met you boy 
 If I can turn back time, then I'll make it so that you were my boo. 
 I wish I never met you boy 
 Every time I'm with my man, all I do is sit and think of you. 
 Don't wanna feel the way I feel about you. 
 (Trina) 
 When we first got together, I saw us chillin' forever. 
 A lifetime, best friend for worse or for better. 
 Then you switched up the weather, sunshine to clouds. 
 I found a condom in ya dresser, and you know how we get down. 
 You fucking clown now I wish I never met cha. 
 I shoulda listened to mama, she said you wasn't nothing special. 
 So now its to the left, to the left 
 And everything you own is on the porch 
 Nigga step and tell me 
 (Shonie) 
 What would you do if you were in my shoes? 
 Would you make it go go or would you wanna choose 
 Between the one you love and between the one you hate 
 'Cause that's just how it is 
 I wish I never met you boy 
 And its killing me to know that I can't have you in my world. 
 I wish I never met you boy 
 If I can turn back time, then I'll make it so that you were my boo. 
 I wish I never met you boy

 (Trina) 
 Maybe I'm trippin', oh I just can't figure you out. 
 One night you say you love me, the next you flippin out. 
 But you can bounce, u know I don't need a man 
 I'm sorry I met u. I could do bad by my damn self. 
 I can't let you disrespect me ima queen. And all my real 
 Boss chicks know what I mean. 
 I bet you still trickin, you ain't learned ya lesson. 
 Now let me check ya text messages now tell me ... hahaaa

 Picture me and you together. 
 Everything about you make my whole body shiver. 
 It's you I want in my world, it's you that I adore. 
 I said I picture me and you together, 
 Everything about you make my whole body shiver. 
 It's you I want in my world, it's you that I adore.
