Boosie badass 
 When you miss somebody, you miss somebody 
 That's how it is (straight up) 
 I'm a send this out to the few women I was in love with (wassup) 
 Why do I feel so lonely in a major way? 
 You know this shit was real and you know it baby 
 I didn't wanna baby, And it drive you crazy 
 Even though you gotta man you forever my lady 
 I miss sipping on your daiquiris 
 I miss your macaroni and cheese, yes indeed 
 With no care, I hit you bare, you know wassup 
 Knowing your body would nut, I taught you everything 
 Make you cry, make you smile, at the same time 
 Dumb shit, baby girl I miss your tongue kiss 
 Miss laying in the bed with you 
 Miss your people and the soul food they fed a nigga 
 Most of all I miss you, I'm having flashbacks 
 Of you coming across the track with your hair wrapped 
 Miss talking on the phone till the early morning 
 Making love off Keith Sweat songs 
 No one can do me like (you) 
 I miss kissing on you 
 You know I miss kissing on you 
 I miss kissing on (you) 
 Miss touching on you baby 
 I miss touching on you 
 I miss touching on you baby 
 I can't stop thinking about (you) 
 I can't stop thinking about you girl 
 I can't stop thinking about (you) 
 I can't stop thinking about you girl 
 It's no mistake that I'm amazing 
 You kissin' touch in lovin' my body, the things you do to me 
 You keep it true to me, all this shit ain't new to me 
 I been messing with ballers kept me lace in top jewlery 
 A hood nigga like you yeah I like that 
 Your swagg on point and you keep it coming right back 
 When you text I right back, yeah right back 
 I know you like that, that's why I handle that 
 Bedroom lights off, we kissin' slow to a track 
 It ain't even 'bout the sex, I crave the gangsta way you act 
 When you all up in that, you so smooth with it 
 That's why I never hesitate to say "daddy come and get it" 
 I got my Vicky's on and my Diamond Princess perfume 
 I can't help but think about the thing we do up in the room 
 When it's just me and you 
 A fantasy come true 
 I can't describe Ooh 
 (I miss kissin' on) 
 I miss kissing on you 
 You know I miss kissing on you 
 I miss kissing on (you) 
 Miss touching on you baby 
 I miss touching on you 
 I miss touching on you baby 
 I can't stop thinking about (you) 
 I can't stop thinking about you girl 
 I can't stop thinking about (you) 
 I can't stop thinking about you girl 
 I swear to god I miss it all 
 The way that you would call 
 Beating up your pussy, knocking pictures off the wall 
 In the studio thinking to myself, "I got one song left, and I'm coming home to you" 
 Love it when I hit you from the back and you look back at me 
 Our sex attractive like metal to a magnet 
 Turn that T.I. On, that's her shit right there 
 Get drunk, now she hollering, "that's her dick right there" 
 I send this off to the ladies who had my head grown 
 A pretty black girl, a couple red bones 
 I guess we learn from each other 'cause we're stepping-stones 
 With kids now like "damn, that's how it is now" 
 Riding to New Orleans, laughing the whole time 
 Living life without a care, walking down Canal 
 I remember how you smell, the polish on your toes 
 Remember the first time you went down low 
 Nobody did it like (you)
