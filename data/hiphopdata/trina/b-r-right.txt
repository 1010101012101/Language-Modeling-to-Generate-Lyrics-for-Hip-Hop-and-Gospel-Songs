 Get pissed and throw my dishes, 
 Y'all niggas know just who this is, 
 Woo woo, and the head so vicious. 
 With me, this shit gon cost, 
 You short? then thas yo lost, 
 You know this ass is soft, 
 Make a nigga go to breakin off. 
 Tell me that you love me baby, 
 Get hot and fuck me crazy, 
 Get a towel and wipe me off, 
 You want a bitch with no type of flaws. 
 My girls be shoppin' hard, 
 These hoes be buyin cars, 
 In the club buyin bars, 
 Nipples hard in designer bras. 
 From the niggas who gettin' cheese, 
 Throw back in the crispy g's, 
 More wet? Christ don't freeze, 
 Laugh at the tab, cause this on me. 
 Me and Luda in the Cut Supreme, 
 Doin' things jus to touch the creme, 
 So many names wanna fuck the queen, 
 I live a life like its jus a dream. 
 (LUDA) 
 Get it right beother, jump, 
 Gimme the beat then imma make it bump, 
 Tell 'em wutcha wana hear, damn, let's get cam, 
 Trouble witcha man, imma pop my trunk. 
 You ain't seen no chicks like mine, 
 You ain't seen no flicks like mine, 
 Bet I make you cum next to the sub woofers and my 6x9's. 
 Tell me that you like it raw, 
 Tell me that my dick is plump, 
 I might make you famous, and buy you watches by Marice MC. Craw 
 Tell me if its new or old, 
 Tell me if its hot or cold, 
 Let me know if its black and bold, 
 Say Ludacris 6 million sold. 
 See I ain't got no time for games, 
 And I ain't got no times for lames, 
 How you lovin' my southern slang, 
 Ooh eee walla walla bing bang. 
 So anytime you need me call, 
 Whether summer, spring, or fall, 
 It doesn't matter come one come all, 
 Either get dropped or drop them draws. 
 (Trina) 
 Diamond princess, 
 Just mind your business, 
 These rumors are senseless, 
 Your whispers are endless. 
 We livin' ghetto fab, 
 We spendin hella cash, 
 This girl is hella bad, 
 Your choice is trailer trash. 
 Too much taste for whores, 
 You saw me grace the stores, 
 Your saw me work the vibe 
 Bitches I works for mine. 
 One time, for these divas, 
 Two times, for these visas, 
 Third time I come I'm breezin, 
 The ice... just keeps on freezin. 
 Hold up imma keep it goin', 
 Back to back imma keep on blowin', 
 Platinum plaques, keepin' it hood, 
 Wet sex, keepin' it good. 
 Look girl, you don't know my angle, 
 A hundred thou with a platinum bangle, 
 My niggas'll slow your roll, 
 Pussy power, we in control.
