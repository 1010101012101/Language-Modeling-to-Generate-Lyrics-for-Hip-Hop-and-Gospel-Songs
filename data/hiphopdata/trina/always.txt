All right, he my little running back 
 But he know I'm running it 
 He love that I'm from the bottom 
 I be all on top of it 
 Yeah, he buy me Louis 
 I buy him Gucci sneaks 
 I got his homies saying I got homie 
 (On a leash) 
 I'm thinking I want this forever like Drake 
 'Cause I'm his nurse, and he my Dr. Dre 
 I'm in Bahamas drinking Nuvo straight 
 I told him I'll be sick if you go, stay 
 Just 'cause there's nobody else 
 That can do the things that you do 
 I promise I'll always be true 
 And when you feel the need to love 
 Let me be the one you're thinkin' of 
 But I will make it so right 
 Forever and ever 
 Baby, I will always be there for you 
 Boy just run to me 'cause 
 There'll never be another, no 
 There'll never be another for me 
 I will always be there for you, baby 
 (I promise) 
 I'm riding with him like Obama 
 'Cause he don't give me drama 
 And his bank account say comma, comma, comma 
 Comma, comma 
 I can't be no calmer 
 It's a honor, take him to meet my momma 
 'C-c-'cause he the best I be all up in his chest 
 He undress me with his eyes when I'm getting dressed 
 I'd be so impressed, other niggas can't impress 
 These are the only words I say when I can't express 
 'Cause there's nobody else 
 That can make me feel the way you do 
 Forever, I'll be there for you 
 And when you feel you need to love 
 Let me be the one you're thinkin' of 
 'Cause I will make it so right 
 Forever and ever 
 Baby I will always be there for you 
 Boy just run to me 'cause 
 There'll never be another, no 
 There'll never be another for me 
 I will always be there for you, baby 
 (I promise) 
 When I met you on the first day 
 Wouldn't never knew that you'd always have a chain on my heart 
 But I gave you a chance, and we're moving, making plans 
 Now all I think about is you 
 'Cause of you and I been through the worst weather 
 And you know love can't get no better 
 You were everything, and everything is you 
 And I'm never leaving, baby I'll stay 
 Because there's nobody else 
 That can make me feel the way you do 
 Forever, I'll always be there for you 
 When you feel you need to love 
 Let me be the one you're thinkin' of 
 'Cause I will make it so right 
 Forever and ever 
 Baby I will always be there for you 
 Boy just run to me 'cause 
 There'll never be another, no 
 There'll never be another for me 
 I will always be there you 
 (I promise, forever)
