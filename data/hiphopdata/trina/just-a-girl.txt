I really need you boo I really need you... sike I thought that we could work it out but I was wrong, I thought that you was the one but I was all wong but now that you are gone I ask myself was it worth it, all the tears I cried to you and all the lies you told to me, we had some good times and I guess all of those good times were all filled with lies, you left me for her, what does she have that I don't, what does she do that I won't... did she feed you the same game you fed me, or did you get tired of me just because it was me... now you wanna be friends I can't have that, I can't be a friend to a man that I love bad... my mind is faded now no nigga ever played me the way you played me . I can't understand what I done wrong, so now that you're gone, I guess you think imma be alone... sike..'briona stay on hers... so know this every time you think of me, know what you let go and not what you had... because Briona will never return to a played toy...
