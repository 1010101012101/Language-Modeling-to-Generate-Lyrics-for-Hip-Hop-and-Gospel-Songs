 You gotta make a nigga bad, make him really want it 
 And once you got him believing that he gonna get it 
 I guarantee you he'll spend a little money on it 
 See, I'll shake a lil' back for a nigga with your hundred stacks of dollars 
 Have him hittin' the mall, comin' back with the Prada 
 Having him leave the stores with the bag full of gifts fo' me

 Diamonds on the wrists, pose up for the pictures 
 Hair and nails did and the heels so vicious 
 Gotta get the dough, gotta, gotta get the dough 
 It don't matter how you get it, girl, you get it and you go 
 When you close to hit it, you better let a nigga know 
 Throw up your middle fingers if you killin' them other hoes
