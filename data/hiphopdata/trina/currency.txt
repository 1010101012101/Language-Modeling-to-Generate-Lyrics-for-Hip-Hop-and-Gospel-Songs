 (Verse: Rick Ross) 
 I'm not a five dolla nigga, I'm a billion dollar entity 
 All I chase is money, only bad bitches interest me 
 Dade County nigga, diamonds come from Tiffany's 
 Bought the prototype, it'll hit the streets eventually 
 Toss my dolla bills. Toss my dolla bills. 
 All I ever wanna do, toss my dolla bills 
 All I talk is cease, u could hear the breeze 
 When the bitches realizin that I'm throwin' hundred beez'--ROSS 
 Twenty, Tens, and Fives (CURRENCY)[x2]

 (Verse: Trina) 
 Twenty's, Fifty's, Hundred's on my bed; I sleep on pay-pah' 
 Pillows made of thousand dollar bills, can you break-hah'? 
 Million Dollar carpet, then I'll fuck it, keep the change 
 I keep a lenin closet of some fresh sheets of "what's his name?" 
 I got Mr. Willdrow Wilsons hit the stock exchange 
 And they know what I want, they sent the money for I came 
 Spend it on the chain; blow it all at the bah' 
 Weezy baby comin' through, and yes it's at TRINArockstarr -- YaH

 (Verse: Lil Wayne)

 Stuck on the bendges like Benjamin Button
