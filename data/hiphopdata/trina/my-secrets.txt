You're my lil secret 
 That's the way we should keep it 
 Yeah, you got a man 
 He ain't really got to know 
 Yeah, I got a girl 
 She ain't really got to know 
 We can keep it private 
 And keep it on the low 
 You're my lil secret, that's how we should keep it 
 I won't tell my friends 
 Don't nobody gotta know 
 Whateva that you need boy, you can come to me boy 
 See I'm independent and I make my own dough 
 We can do whateva 
 I can do it better 
 We can take a private flight and get away and go 
 You can call me baby, I can be your lady 
 Soon as you get ready, won't you let your girl know 
 'Cause baby if you won't tell, I won't either 
 Take this trip with a rock star diva 
 You don't need her and I don't need him either 
 I promise if you do it, you'll be wishin' you could leave her 
 You're my lil secret 
 That's the way we should keep it 
 Yeah, you got a man 
 He ain't really got to know 
 Yeah, I got a girl, she ain't really got to know 
 We can keep it private 
 And keep it on the low 
 I got trust in the world when I'm thinkin' of you 
 Yeah I got a man, but I'm thinkin' 'bout you 
 He don't know how to get it wet and do the things you do 
 I can't put it in no other words 
 I'm so open with you 
 We both know its wrong, I think that's why we do it 
 We can't stay long, so we get right to it 
 We do it 
 Pillow talk and get back to it 
 The bed be so wet, I just love the way you do it 
 Ooh-wee-baby when you touch my body, I go crazy 
 I be bout to lose my mind, on the daily 
 Reminiscin' on the love you gave me 
 You're my lil secret 
 That's the way we should keep it 
 Yeah, you got a man 
 But he ain't really got to know 
 Yeah, I got a girl she ain't really got to know 
 We can keep it private 
 And keep it on the low 
 'Cause you're my secret 
 I won't tell nobody 
 How I give you my love, kisses and hugs 
 If nobody knows, they can't break us up
