The things you do, girl 
 For my lovin', for my love 
 She would cheat on her man with me 
 At the[unverified] time just to get all my love 
 Take a vacation girl 
 You know my location 
 Just to get some of my love 
 Fly to Jamaica 'cause she love me art flavor 
 'Cause she can't get sick of my love 
 When I'm given her the touch 
 She caught me in a rush 
 She pourin' into my love 
 The things you do, girl 
 For my lovin', for my love 
 The things you do, girl 
 For my lovin', for my love 
 For my lovin' 
 VP perfume on my wrists 
 Trips from Miami down to Atlantis 
 Chris, make me wonder why my body like this 
 I want you to myself, I guess I'm so selfish 
 The queen with the crown 
 Drop it to the ground 
 Pop the [unverified] 
 And turn it upside down 
 When you look me in me eyes 
 And you grind on me thighs 
 Make my blood pressurize 
 Say, she just the right size 
 Wayne Wonder sing 
 I know what you want 
 I got what you need 
 I'm a beast in the bed 
 But a lady in the streets 
 I know a little spot 
 Where the beach is the bluest 
 Baby, we could do this 
 And carpul sayin' Lucas 
 You know what I'm about 
 Now show me what you got 
 I party like a rock star 
 On the deck of the yacht 
 We could sail on the seas 
 Make a stop in belize 
 If you got Trina what else do you need? 
 Wayne Wonder sing 
 The things you do, girl 
 For my lovin', for my love 
 The things you do, girl 
 For my lovin', for my love 
 She would give her man bun 
 Just because I'm more fun 
 So she keep coming back for my love 
 From she get a push 
 She pours her emotions 
 Excessive morn for my love 
 Deep in her thoughts 
 She get lost 
 Thinking about my love 
 Even if she get puss 
 Just because I get floss 
 Still gonna press for my love 
 The things you do, girl 
 For my lovin', for my love 
 The things you do, girl 
 For my lovin', for my love
