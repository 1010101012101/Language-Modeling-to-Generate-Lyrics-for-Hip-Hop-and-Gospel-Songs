 (Intro: Trina) 
 Welcome to wonderful sexy wet world of trina 
 I got a problem (I love to fuck) [x8] 
 (Verse 1: Trina) 
 Head fire pussy good and plus I stay wet 
 Just fuck me earlier in the morning baby that's the best 
 Just keep it hard for me nigga and let me do the rest 
 I wanna feel it in my stomach push it my chest 
 And pin my legs back and make my toes touch my neck 
 Want you stand up in this pussy and don't you nut yet 
 I'm a let you work me out gon fuck me make me sweat 
 Don't take it out just lay in it if you need rest 
 I got a problem (I love to fuck) [x8] 
 (Verse 2: Plies) 
 I wanna lock her up in the crib and fuck her all day 
 And fuck ya on the couch and eat ya in the hallway 
 And walk around naked and put the cell phones away 
 Whenever you want this dick just look at me and say bae 
 Whenever that pussy get soaked we can call it today 
 I wanna catch ya on that look and put it on ya ass 
 And pin yo lil ass up and fuck ya like a mass 
 I wanna finger you first make ya wanna fuck me bad 
 Soon as I feel that pussy get wet step on the gas 
 And I'm a fuck ya from the back but I'm a do it last 
 I want you to ride me first while I squeeze on ya ass 
 Whenever you feel that nut comin' want you to fuck me fast 
 I got a problem (I love to fuck) [x8] 
 (Verse 3: Trina) 
 Don't just fuck me in the bed do me in the shower 
 And don't you tease me with that dick want you to fuck me for hours 
 And when you put me on my side it make me holler louder 
 And you don't want me to soak up the bed you better fuck me on a towel 
 'Cause I got so much of this good juice built up inside 
 And we can do whatever you want I just wanna feel you baby 
 Just thinkin' you 'bout you inside it it got me goin' crazy 
 And whenever you get out this pussy bet you'll call me a lady 
 And let me lay on my stomach get in yo favorite positon 
 I might just kiss ya in mouth before you start lickin' 
 I got my legs spread ass up waitin on the dick and 
 And can't nobody out fuck me I need some competition 
 All over the house we gon tear it up (hey) 
 In the kitchen on the countertop knockin' over stuff 
 The livin' room the den or even on the stairs (oh) 
 In the morning when we dress we can't find our underwear 
 You got that ooh wee wet as a raindrop the feelin' that you give 
 If my toes pop up 
 So don't get mad at me girl if I come quick you got to understand you got good shit 
 I got a problem I love to fuck [x8]
