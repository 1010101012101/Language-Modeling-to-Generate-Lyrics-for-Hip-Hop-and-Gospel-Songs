Hey... 
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 No, no, no, no, no, no 
 It's been too long and I'm lost without you 
 What am gonna do 
 Said I been needing you; wanting you 
 Wondering if your the same and who's been with you 
 Is your heart still mine I wanna cry sometime 
 Off to college, yes you went away 
 Straight from high school you up and left me 
 We where close friends also lovers 
 Did everything for one another 
 Now you're gone and I'm lost without you here now 
 But I know I got to live and make it somehow 
 (Come back to me can you feel me calling hear me calling for you) 
 'Cause it's been too long and I'm lost without you 
 What am I gonna do said I've been 
 Needing you wanting you 
 Wondering if your the same and who's been with you 
 Is your heart still mine I wanna cry sometimes 
 Now I'm sitting here 
 Thinking 'bout you and the days we used to share 
 It's driving me crazy I don't know what to do 
 I'm just wondering if you still care 
 And I don't wanna let you know 
 That it's killing me 
 I know you got another life you gotta concentrate baby 
 (Come back to me can you feel me calling here me calling for you) 
 'Cause it's been too long and I'm lost without you 
 What am I gonna do said I've been needing you wanting you 
 Wondering if your the same and who's been with you is your heart 
 Still mine I wanna cry sometimes 
 I miss you... 
 Ayi yi yi yi yi 
 Ayi yi yi yi yi 
 Ayi yi yi yi yi 
 Ayi yi yi yi yi 
 I can't think no more since you went away 
 I don't really feel like talking 
 No one hear to love me 
 Baby do you understand me 
 I can't do a thing without you 
 It's been too long... 
 And I'm lost without you 
 What am I gonna do said I've been needing 
 You wanting you 
 Wondering if your the same and who's been with you 
 Is your heart still mineeeeee
