 He ain't never see a five star looking like this 
 He ain't never had me, I'm as good as it gets 
 Got a small thick frame, I spit a lot of game 
 305 representer off glass off the chain 
 I'm in the flyest fashion, 3-6-5 
 And ain't no doubt about it, yeah, I'm all the way live 
 See, I push a brinks truck so I'm always on full 
 I ain't waitin' on those lies, 40 acres and a mule 
 The boys see me coming, you should see them make it rain 
 They get wild with them hundreds, they know 50's ain't my thang 
 Cute face, nice ass with a lot of class 
 Them birds stay jealous 'cause they back do trash 
 Rearview in the past, never lived to see it coming 
 They know I'm in the swap when the crowd start running 
 I'm carried by the Ferros, new home out in Melrose

 Told him, "Show me what you got, you a man or a mouse?"
