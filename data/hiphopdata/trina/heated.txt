 (Trina) 
 Bad bitch from the south keep shit locked 
 Any bitch run her mouth will get dropped 
 See me ride in six, dropped 
 You ain't heard, my nookie so good it could ressurrect 'Pac 
 Trina ride on a track, never take a pit stop 
 You only on the radio 'cause you fuckin' disc Joc 
 It's Saturday, let da 'cris pop 
 Me and lil' Bre, Von Dutch, head to the Flip-Flops 
 Hop out of the G-5 and on to the jet 
 You in that Nissan, that's why you ain't get respect 
 Everywhere I go, I got cameras flashin' 
 You the preview, I'm the main attraction 
 Yes ya man is watchin', you gettin' all mad 
 Ya' heart beats fast every time I walk past 
 My hand real hard, but I got a soft ass 
 I play the sweet role 
 Don't make me get off glass 
 Pick it up 
 U don't wanna see me heated y'all (pick it up) 
 U don't wanna see me heated y'all (pick it up) 
 U don't wanna see me heated y'all (tell me why girl) 
 Bitch I'll fuck yo ass up 
 Pick it up 
 U don't wanna see me heated y'all (pick it up) 
 U don't wanna see me heated y'all (pick it up) 
 U don't wanna see me heated y'all (tell me why girl) 
 Bitch I'll fuck yo ass up 
 (Trina) 
 Shit can't stop, crickedy jeans wit' da Matchin' tanktop 
 Tell me I ain't hot 
 If you think not lanm hoe catch shots 
 Dis niggah think' I'm sweatin' his Rolex watch 
 You need more than that, to get in my thighs 
 Car that flies, maybe a house in the sky 
 I know you wanna beat it up right quick 
 And I was the first bitch Kobe cheated on his wife wit' 
 Tight shit, Diamond Princess 
 Don't be the first name, on my hitlist 
 Trust me, that's not a good look 
 Imma Vet', you a Rook', hoes better get shook 
 Bitch go and read a book 
 Find something to slob 
 You workin' my nerves like a part time job 
 5 years in the game, still undefeated 
 We can do the damn thing, don't get me heated 
 Pick it up 
 U don't wanna see me heated y'all (pick it up) 
 U don't wanna see me heated y'all (pick it up) 
 U don't wanna see me heated y'all (tell me why girl) 
 Bitch I'll fuck yo ass up 
 Pick it up 
 U don't wanna see me heated y'all (pick it up) 
 U don't wanna see me heated y'all (pick it up) 
 U don't wanna see me heated y'all (tell me why girl) 
 Bitch I'll fuck yo ass up 
 (Trina) 
 Miss Trina, ahead of the game 
 Act up hoes better get ready for pain 
 No talk, I don't let 'em explain 
 Off the chain from' the city in the south 
 Where da weather da same 
 Drunk niggas in the club, stay spittin' they game 
 He wanna make sweet love 
 But I'd rather the brains 
 Better eat it till I can't walk straight 
 And if Chingy ever tried, he'll prolly talk straight 
 I'm that bitch that you hate, gettin' paid to rap 
 Bust forgot his rhymes when I made it clap 
 I'm the first girl that put daid on the map 
 I touch my toes, ya' man came in his lap 
 Hypno and 'cris might have you fuckin' tonight 
 And if you can't feel this, you ain't touchin' it right (shhhit) 
 I know Cali got my back 
 And when you turn it up 
 Then hit the lights, bitch watch ya' back
