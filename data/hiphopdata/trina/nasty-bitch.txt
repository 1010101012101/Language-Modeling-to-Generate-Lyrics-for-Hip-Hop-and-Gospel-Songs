Trina: 
 Get involved with a nigga 
 Slob on a nigga 
 Take all his dough, then I dodge the nigga 
 'Cause I'm a nasty bitch 
 I leave a nigga dead broke 
 Snatch your bread and cop a brand new coach 
 I'm the jazzy type 
 And I only let you in if you ask me right 
 My coochie mad tight 
 With more juice then a grape when you peel the skin 
 But you it ain't no fun if your tongue ain't in (woa now) 
 This is where the madness stops 
 Nigga fuck me with your tongue till you lick the spot 
 I got a body like a coke bottle watch me walk 
 So nigga work your mouth and don't talk ow 
 Roll like game must say I don't sweat 
 No tired ass nigga I sign my own check 
 I'm the diamond princess 
 Dutchess of all walls 
 Pussy stay tighter and wetter then all ya'lls 
 Money Mark: 
 You nasty bitch you nasty (uh-huh) 
 You nasty bitch you nasty (uh-huh) 
 You nasty bitch you nasty (what) 
 Trina you so nasty 
 You nasty bitch you nasty (uh-huh) 
 You nasty bitch you nasty (uh-huh) 
 You nasty bitch you nasty (what) 
 Trina hurry subduct him 
 Fat back with a real slim waist (what's wrong) 
 Can't talk with a pussy in your face then 
 Keep me sprung with the tongue like 
 Make me cum till I'm numb oh yes 
 Rub my chest make me wet 
 Doggy style do it just like the best 
 And lick the sweat it tastes just so sweet 
 When I pop my cock and make it drop to the beat like 
 Nasty bitch make a nigga sell his dick 
 Just to buy me shit 
 And to keep me lookin' raw in all the finest shit 
 And if ya with me girlfriends shake your hind to this 
 'Cause I roll like game must say I don't sweat 
 No tired ass nigga I sign my own check 
 I'm the diamond princess 
 Dutchess of all walls 
 Pussy stay tighter and wetter then all ya'lls 
 Broke ass niggas can't roll with me 
 And even rich niggas can't get a hold of me 
 Never backed up fuck game long and strong 
 Coochie so good break up happy homes 
 'Cause I roll like game must say I don't sweat 
 No tired ass niggas I sign my own check 
 I'm the diamond princess 
 Dutchess of all walls 
 Pussy stay tighter and wetter then all ya'lls
