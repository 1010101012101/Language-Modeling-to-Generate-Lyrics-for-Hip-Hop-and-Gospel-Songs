Loyalty 
 It's the code of the streets 
 The words we live by and die by 
 You know, the way we survive this life out here 
 It's no other way 
 The only way 
 Is to be loyal till the end 
 Loyalty 
 The code of the street 
 The word I live by and die by ain't nothin' sweet 
 Rap star goes Hollywood from the street 
 And the only word that I know is loyalty 
 See I know the difference, separate the bullshit from the business 
 Feel me? listen 
 I am past driven 
 Nothin' was given 
 I can't remember of days I had livin' 
 Trust nobody keep your enemies close 
 Where your friends when you need them? when you need them the most? 
 Most times that you need them most of them are ghost 
 Even though they unloyal, still give them a toast 
 Trust nobody keep your enemies close 
 Who know your dark secrets what you doin' the most? 
 You know that hot shit ?? bout to promote like rappers talking bout guns and don't even tote 
 Yeah 
 L.O.Y.A.L.T.Y 
 Loyalty 
 Loyal till the day I die 
 That's the code of the streets 
 That's the way I ride & I'ma ride like that 
 Some friends got the best of me, 
 Shitted on me along the way 
 But I wonder was it all for the destiny? 
 Now there's a difference see? 
 You ain't gotta rob a man, or take nothin' 
 You can use your own energy 
 See I depend on me 
 Bless the child with its own 
 Grab my own glass say bless and you hold it into me 
 See ain't no killin' me 
 I know you feelin' me 
 I blast the speakers with the truth 
 Hear the chemistry 
 Trust nobody, keep your enemies close 
 Where your friends when you need them? when you need them the most? 
 Most times that you need them most of them are ghost 
 Even though they unloyal, still give them a toast 
 Trust nobody keep your enemies close 
 Who know your dark secrets? what you're doin' the most? 
 You know that hot shit ?? bout to promote like rappers talking bout guns and don't even tote 
 L.O.Y.A.L.T.Y 
 Loyalty 
 Loyal till the day I die 
 That's the code of the streets 
 That's the way I ride & I'ma ride like that 
 X2: 
 He say, She say, Tell somebody 
 Can you keep a secret? don't tell nobody 
 It's your loyalty, pill, will you switch for money? 
 When your shit hit the fame will you think its funny? 
 Trust nobody keep your enemies close 
 Where your friends when you need them 
 When you need them the most? 
 Most times that you need them most of them are ghost 
 Even doe they unloyal still give them a toast 
 Trust nobody keep your enemies close 
 Who know your dark secrets what you doin' the most?
