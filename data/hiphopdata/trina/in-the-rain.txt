I wanna spend all night with you, in the falling rain 
 In the rain 
 I wanna spend all night with you, 
 Have you screaming out my name 
 Screaming out my name 
 Spend all night with you, in the falling rain 
 In the rain 
 I wanna spend all night with you, 
 Have you screamin out my name 
 I can't wait to take my clothes off 
 Let me be your Night-quill, 
 You can take me till you doze off 
 I need your front and your back stroke 
 Not no one minute man 
 A real pro 'cause I don't play jokes 
 I need it hard, I need it bad 
 Please don't argue me, just come and take it like you're mad 
 I need it good, I need it hood 
 I've been a naughty girl, so discipline me with that wood 
 Now keep this ass jumpin', like you do 
 We ain't near stopping, till we through 
 I hear you say you love me, I love you 
 Just give me loud moaning, like Ooh Ooh 
 I wanna spend all night with you, in the falling rain 
 In the rain 
 I wanna spend all night with you, 
 Have you screamin out my name 
 Spend all night with you, in the falling rain, 
 In the rain 
 I wanna spend all night with you 
 Have you screamin out my name 
 Screamin out my name 
 Light all the candles, pour the wax 
 Tongue down my body, down my back 
 Pull on my hair babe 
 I love that 
 You got me open, that's a fact 
 I hope they can't hear me, when I scream 
 Know how to give me, what I need 
 When I be fiening 
 I'm a fien 
 Where am I floating in this dream? 
 Now keep this ass jumpin', like you do 
 We ain't near stopping, till we through 
 I hear you say you love me, I love you 
 You give me loud moaning like Ooh Ooh 
 I wanna spend all night with you, in the falling rain 
 In the rain 
 I wanna spend all night with you, 
 Have you screaming out my name 
 Screaming out my name 
 Spend all night with you, in the falling rain 
 In the rain 
 I wanna spend all night with you, 
 Have you screamin out my name
