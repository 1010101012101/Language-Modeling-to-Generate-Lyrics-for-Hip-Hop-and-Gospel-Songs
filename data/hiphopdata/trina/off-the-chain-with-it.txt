What time y'all?? Ball off tha chain 
 (Trick Daddy) 
 You off tha chain wit it, 
 You do your thang wit it 
 Tha way you talk, tha way you walkin' 
 You on tha road lil' momma 
 Girl you slang wit it 
 Outta control lil' momma 
 Never know dis b'4, but damn you swole lil momma 
 (VERSE 1: Trina) 
 Like I said before, you don't nann hoe 
 Who off tha chain like me, you understand hoe? 
 I got tha niggas at me, I got tha bitches at me 
 Slow your roll hoe, Lil' Momma strictly dick 
 I'm the bitch that got you lame hoes poppin' shit 
 At the shows dyke hoes blowin' kisses at me

 Lil' Momma gettin' plenty g's and I got 'em hollerin 
 (VERSE 2: Trina) 
 Ain't no secret baby 
 You know lil' momma shinin'

 Nigga let them g's loose 
 You know lil' momma play 
 Or rob that bank playboy 
 Peel them g's loose 
 You know lil' momma baddest bitch on tha south coast 
 I got these buck niggas trickin' of their house note 
 'Cause I'm off tha glass wit it

 Pretty face, slim waist, phat ass wit it 
 (VERSE 3: Trick Daddy) 
 You off tha chain wit it, ha, off tha chain wit it, 
 See I can tell by your smile,

 Got on these strap up heels, and your P thangs on 
 You got your hair all done 
 You off tha chain wit it 
 Somebody ta watch your son 
 You slang your than you makin' change wit it 
 For a lil cash

 For a lil' this 
 For a lil that

 I'll be up supportin' your cause 
 Flirtin' all week long

 (Trina)

 Uh, now I'm makin' hits again 
 Last year y'all remember how I came wit it 
 Got you hatin' hoes sick again

 And them niggas hollerin'
