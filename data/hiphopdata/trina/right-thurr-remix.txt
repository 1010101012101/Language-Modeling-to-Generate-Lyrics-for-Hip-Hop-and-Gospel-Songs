(Trina) 
 Ms. Trina make the ballas wanna starr 
 Hoza-Notie boots lined with the fur 
 Walk with a switch pull it over make it twerk 
 I'm'a flirt till it hur in a throwback skirt 
 I'm dat bad bitch, foxy and Don Blaze 
 Rocks on my wrist like pink lemonade 
 I'll take ya watches and ya rings 
 Tell them other girls, lil' mama rockin' strings and Chanel pearls 
 I'm back fo my crown, fake bitches bow down 
 Dis the remix what you wanna do now? 
 I know you like the way we do this ova herrr 
 Get loose in the club like we just don't carrr (carr)
