 Verse 1: Trina

 The way he make me scream when he give me that thang, 
 Throw my face in the pillow now, hey. (x2) 
 Call him when I wanna f***, say he give me luck, 
 When he throw me that pipe, I just pack them stacks up. 
 Throw ma face in the pillow now, hey. (x2) 
 Dang so damn hood, dang a lang so good, 
 Like a foot long sub, eat it all if I could. 
 Stomach like a jerk, do his six pack good.

 Verse 2: Trina 
 His dang a lang so pretty, 'bout 12 inches, 
 So I let him meet kitty, now they best friends. 
 I am made good and plenty. 
 All I want to do is feel that dang a lang in me, 
 Make him drive it live in me. 
 Till I smoke like a chimney. 
 Real hard in me (voice over) 
 I make him slim jimmy, 
 Even better on the remy, 
 I know the neighbours hear me 
 They probably standing ear to wall and what's he doing to me 
 Verse 3: Nicki Minaj 
 Excuse me, can I see your dang a lang, brother? 
 I mean, ya know, juggle ya balls like the Wrangling Brothers. 
 I'm the Harajuku Barbie, 
 I ain't tripping on your change, 
 I mean look I got the sports package on my range. 
 I just dip in the pink for the pink effect. 
 D-D-D-Diamonds on my neck for the link effect, 
 And I was wondering if I could lip sync on that, 
 You know my name ring (ting), 
 Ring tinkle bells. 
 Wa-Wa-Wa-Watch (That) 
 Chain (Check) 
 They be on a rain check 
 I be on the move, 
 They be reachin' but they can't catch. 
 I'm with the Baddest B**** 
 On the island styling 
 Black Miley Cyrus, 
 Playing hide the pirate. 
 I be singin' them ballads, 
 When he tossin' my salad, 
 When I pet my parrot, 
 All you see is colorful carrots. 
 I be singin' them ballads, 
 When he tossin' my salad, 
 When I pet my parrot, 
 All you see is colorful carrots.
