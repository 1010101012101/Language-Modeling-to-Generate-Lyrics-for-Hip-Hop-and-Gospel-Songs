 ...Get ya mutha fucker, smoke listening to shot day 
 I love my pain and ... why can't you see she's my way, 
 You want that lonely highway, 
 My cost ...on the drive way 
 Feels like I'm dying slowly, feels like ...what can I say 
 I made you face your fears, I think we could have made it 
 Thought I told you I love you, maybe we should have waited, 
 How could you ever doubt me when I stood by you properly 
 I would have gave my last breath, now you can breathe without me. 
 ...In the club, all you think is about you baby 
 ...In the club, all you think is about you baby 
 Baby I want you to need me, I need you to want me, 
 Baby I want you to love me forever. 
 Baby I want you to need me, I need you to want me, 
 Baby I want you to love me forever.
