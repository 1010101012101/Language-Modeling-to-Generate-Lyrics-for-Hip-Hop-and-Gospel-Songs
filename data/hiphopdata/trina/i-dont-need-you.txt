 See I don't need Nann Nigga 
 Jockin' me, slowing me down 
 Or stoppin' me 
 Climbing all on top of me 
 If he ain't gonna fuck me properly 
 It's got to be, possibly 
 A dick that ain't too soft for me 
 Nigga get your ass up off of me 
 Besides your dick to small for me 
 I gots to be fucked right, sucked right 
 In the butt right like a slut like 
 In the bright lights, every day all night 
 Now talk to me, why you fuck me violently? 
 Calling me names that don't apply to me 
 Cummin' all inside of me 
 Don't lie to me, now tell the truth 
 Is the pussy good for you? 
 Gripping you, good and tight 
 But full of juice 
 Why wouldn't you? 
 Why shouldn't you? 
 Scream while I am riding you 
 Over you making this pussy stroke for you 
 Like your bitch supposed to do 
 Close to you and I'm feeling most of you 
 Deep for me, we can meet 
 Fuck me till I fall asleep 
 Nothing less than three nuts for me 
 Or get your ass up off of me 
 Ol' tired ass nigga besides you ain't even all that anyway 
 Fuck you! 
 (Trick Daddy) 
 Bitch I don't need you 
 No way, no how, not then, not now 
 Uh-uh, bitch 
 Repeat (3x) 
 (Trick Daddy) 
 Oh you done blowed 
 Bitched you done showed out 
 And I got no beef 
 If this was my house bitch 
 You would've been thrown out 
 And why'all bitches better hold up 
 Simmer down and get the fours up 
 Mouth all tored up 
 All this is swolled up 
 Why'all bitches better show some love 
 Or your licking these nuts saying that freaky stuff 
 And you ain't gotta have the best head 
 But bitch it better be close enough 
 See I don't need ya, I don't see ya 
 And I really won't want to be ya 
 If head is nappy and you boppin' me 
 Young bitch then that's illegal 
 You always braggin' and beggin' 
 Talkin' 'bout what the last nigga gave ya 
 See everybody ain't able 
 But why'all bitches so ungrateful 
 You need to ask questions about douching 
 'Cause I hate the smell of stank pussy 
 And you're under arms a little musky 
 I was gonna spare ya but you had to push me 
 Repeat (4x)
