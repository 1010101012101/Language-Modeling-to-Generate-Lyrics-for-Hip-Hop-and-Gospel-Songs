 Party like a rock

 T-T-Totally Dude! 
 I rock my body like a rockstar 
 Live like a moviestar 
 Play like a allstar 
 Fuck like a pornstar 
 Baby I'm a superstar 
 You can call me Pamela 
 Anderson plus I rock the stage like Marilyn Manson 
 No hands, no skirt 
 Look at me- I'm a flirt 
 I'm in the club poppin' bottles 
 Lookin' like a supermodle 
 Plus my girls are hella pretty 
 So dem bitches real sadity 
 Attitudes sometimes shitty 
 Rockstar chicks run tha city 
 It's tha rockstar extraordinaire 
 Throw ur hands in tha air 
 Wave 'em like you just don't care 
 Patron shots everywhere 
 Crash a party anywhere 
 If you don't like me, I don't care 
 I know you lookin', gone stare 
 I got haters everywhere 
 Plus I'm tha fast car 
 Kinda like Nascar 
 The boys screamin' Trina stop 
 But Trina screamin' Kidd Rock 
 Just found out I got a stalker 
 Ow my God it's Travis Parker 
 Told you I'ma superstar 
 Come party with a rockstar 
 Yeah-it's tha rockstar extraordinaire 
 And I wonna shout out all my motherfuckin rockstars 
 All over tha world 
 Rockstars in tha building 
 I see you 
 El Boogie I see you
