(Intro - Ace Hood) 
 Chea 
 Gutta 
 See what you have is that movement my nigga 
 It's Flo Rida 
 Ace Hood homie 
 (Chorus - Flo Rida) 
 You know my, face good while they ask me on deck 
 Flo Rida and Ace because the ghetto got next 
 My face good, my face good in the hood 
 My face good 
 Yeah 
 You know my, face good while they ask me on deck 
 Flo Rida and Ace because the ghetto got next 
 My face good, my face good in the hood 
 My face good 
 Yeah 
 From the streets, to the block, to the trap, to the hood 
 I never got a problem let me get you understood 
 My face good, my face good in the hood 
 My face good 
 Hey 
 (Verse 1 - Ace Hood) 
 Chea 
 1988 momma birthed a fucking G 
 I tell her fuck a bottle give me Hennessy to drink 
 The only drink allowed to put me in my deeper sleep 
 Wake up in the morning on the corner ain't no school for me 
 Nigga bought them peaches that be preaching 
 Serving work and trees, had a Visa card, hella stacks 
 And only seventeen, my face is good in the hood 
 I was serving beans 
 A real nigga they salute you when you getting green 
 The youngest niggas on the block toting .17s 
 The AR is tucked in side of my denim jeans 
 So show your past or get stretched like a flat screen 
 I'm certified and born to ride, I am the streets 
 (Verse 2 - Ace Hood) 
 Chea 
 I'm in that butter pecan Beamer creeping through the hood 
 Got to keep it gutter, motherfuckers knew a nigga would 
 But I got a pass courtesy of me and face good 
 In the streets of my city, block in my damn hood 
 Where niggas take your life for free like a canned good 
 I'm certified, me and Flo Rida remain hood 
 Better state your presence when you stepping through a man's hood 
 Or you get caught up with them choppers, leave you dead holmes 
 Because even in the middle of the hood you got a dead zone 
 Red zone, fake face do your head gone 
 I'm from the city niggas die to pay a cell phone 
 It ain't right, that's life, get your bang on 
 (Verse 3 - Ace Hood) 
 Chea 
 And I was the low key nigga posted by the front door 
 Young dreadlock niggas rocking them Dickies and a torch 
 Got a house of red band, forced to keep me on the porch 
 Well look, I don't give a fuck because these crackers show no remorse 
 Trying to serve a nigga murder but never heard of the source 
 They ask me where I got the weed from 
 Then I serve and feed some 
 Trying to put my finger prints all on a clean gun 
 A real nigga never born to be a snitch 
 Never knew I'd be rich 
 But the streets made ki's 
 And since legit a nigga stayed in the mix 
 Never snitching on a bitch 
 So the FEDS know shit 
 Payed my dues to the real, I was good with the bricks
