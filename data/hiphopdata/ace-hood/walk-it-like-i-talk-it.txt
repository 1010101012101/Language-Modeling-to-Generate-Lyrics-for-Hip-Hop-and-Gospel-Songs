OK, I stepped off in this motherfucker bank roll on me 
 Feelin' myself, got a couple chains on me 
 See I think I'm the shit and you should think the same 
 I'm swagging with them all bet them bitches know my name 
 'Cause I walk it like I talk it, play it how I say it 
 Them other niggers starving, I'm out here getting fed 
 'Cause I walk it like I talk it, walk it like I talk it 
 Want it then I cop it, it's no longer on the market 
 OK now, more money more problems 
 Just bring me my dollars 
 See I'm 'bout my 'fetti, paper chasing scholar 
 Got them diamonds on my wrist, more off from my collar 
 Swag is on that ugh, talking Chewbaccaa 
 I pull up in that Gallardo, hoppin' off with the models 
 Hand ?, they might have some type of choppers 
 I just tell you how to play it, watch what you be sayin' 
 Walk it like I talk it bitch I'm focused on the Benz 
 I pull up to any club, you already know 
 There go mister hood, just don't check your methadone 
 Got that bumper label on, oh I think I'm fly 
 Bitch you know I is, that's exactly my reply 
 OK, I'm too raw for you bitches snitches 
 Living what you wishing 
 Kid gon' keep that pistol, swear one day it meet you stitches 
 You should see me when I'm locking, sipping on my lil potion 
 Have them bitches bugging, yeah I'm talking roaches 
 'Cause I walk it like I talk it, cop it if I like it 
 Wanna bet I get her whether super straight or dykin' 
 Swangin' off in that Jag with the top peelin' back 
 Just to make them mad, just another paper tag 
 I'm so down for the talking, that's just if you cash 
 What you say? what you say? 
 Ok, we ain't talking about paper 
 You can kindly kiss my ass
