A old school Chevy, big motor pipes, twenty six flo 
 Get your money right, a hundred for the chain 
 Twenty for the ring, the bitches know the name 
 My watch and chain like, hello, hello, hello 
 Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello 
 Hello, hello, hello, I'm in this thing like 
 Chea 
 Ace Hood! 
 I'm in this motherfucker, so what it is? 
 And what it do though? 
 You keep the two, I be riding in that four door 
 I hit the club let them hoes take a photo 
 I'm getting more dough, trunk full of white snow 
 Just hit me on my TMO, I get your price low 
 Hot up off the press, call it espresso 
 I'm getting Starbucks 
 That's twenty five a show 
 I'm getting Starbucks 
 That's twenty five a show 
 I'm getting Starbucks 
 That's twenty five a show 
 Sorry I got to go, I'm on my money shit 
 If you ain't talking dollars, holler "That's irrelevant!" 
 I'm watching aliens, it ain't from this planet 
 You see the bright lit bezel, haters can't stand it 
 My neck on froze, call it the North Pole, my pockets on swole 
 I'm good to go, hello! 
 I got it jumping like Jell-O 
 Bitches heard the Chevy call that bitch Donatello 
 Chea 
 And yes sir, it is I again 
 Bang bang let me in this motherfucker 
 Now we headed to the V.I.P. section 
 You heard him in your town you better send your text in 
 You see the necklace, talking when the light hit 
 Barack Obama chain, copped it for election, you try to snatch mine 
 Baby it's chopper time, you catching twenty nine 
 So pussy nigga 
 Hello! 
 Yeah, and I'm a fool like LO 
 See me on the L.O., moving bricks by the L.O. 
 I pull up in that Charger, something like San Diego 
 Sitting in a deuce tre O, money out of the window 
 Chain telling them, hello! 
 Little momma what's your name? 
 I know she see the frames, she hypnotized by the ring 
 So I walk up in this thing, I'm sure to get me some brain 
 I'm sure you know the name, when I'm pulling up in this thing 
 And uh
