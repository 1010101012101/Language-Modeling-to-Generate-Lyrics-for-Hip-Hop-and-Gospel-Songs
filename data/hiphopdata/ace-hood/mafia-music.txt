See the streets got a feeling what I'm speaking is the truth 
 These other niggas lying they defying in a booth 
 I just picture B.I.G. and resurrecting him with juice 
 And hoping Heaven got a ghetto for a nigga too 
 That's worded from the D.A.C. you need to see the truth 
 I was only seventeen serving after school groups 
 A menace to society, variety I'm proof 
 Some go for that eleven, yeah that's at for twenty two 
 I missed a lot of sunny days, they kept me in a room 
 That's why I copped that coupe, and chopped the motherfucking roof 
 So everyday I ride and I can get the love the view 
 I watched my money stack while I minajed in a pool 
 The same damn Ace that they decided was a fool 
 Remember in high school me couldn't ball was the news? 
 I just switched to different views, put them haters on snooze 
 I just had to renegotiate and calculate the moves 
 I went from show and telling nigga to the show improved 
 And now it's three whips, with a mansion and a pool 
 Louis Vuitton don sipping coconuts a cool 
 See the diamonds in my shades that's a rich nigga's soos 
 Give a fuck about a hater because I'm back in round two 
 Now that is what it do, now tell me who is you? 
 Only Benjamin alive, so you better show your use 
 See We the Best the mob, and the future's in the booth 
 Imprinted in my life and I can show you niggas proof 
 D.A.D. full of goons beg them niggas not to shoot 
 Because while them pussies creeping, they be peeping on the roof 
 They hating what I'm making leave you vacant by the two 
 And snitches die slow, them sucker niggas uninvited 
 And celebrate by lighters, hit the kush to get us higher 
 The heartily unit us just bring me women like Titans 
 The best to ever speak it from a real nigga Bible 
 Ruthless
