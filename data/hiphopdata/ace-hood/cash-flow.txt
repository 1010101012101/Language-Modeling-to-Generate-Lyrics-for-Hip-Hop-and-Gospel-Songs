We the best def jam 
 I introduce you to ace 
 Ace let's get money 
 Cash flow... (haha) 
 It's too easy nigga (bankroll) 
 We don't count money no mo 
 We weight that shit 
 (Adlibs: Rick Ross) 
 Let's get it... 
 (Verse: Ace Hood) 
 Eh knock knock, bang bang 
 Where the cash at 
 If you ain't got it leave you bloody like a tampax 
 Come up swinging at you thugs aflac 
 Then I fall in the sway back may back 
 See I'm back for da money like I left dat 
 See I be runnin' on the route where da cash go (where da cash go) 
 And any nigga interfering with the cash flow so he can get pumped on like Citgo 
 Make his body bounce bounce like a 64 
 Tall clips chrome lips see the big gold 
 I'm a duffle bag boy like I move coke big crack threw tha music so the flow dope 
 I keep my money ova bitches till da door close 
 I need money like a bitch need dick mo 
 I'm tryna c it like a muhfuckin castro rubber bands in my pants and a swift bankroll 
 (Chorus: T-Pain) 
 I'll tell ya one thang don't play about mine 
 I be bangin' on your front door with da nine 
 I'm a come see ya (see ya) 
 I'm a come see ya (see ya) 
 I need all my dough not a dolla short 
 And if you don't have it den you gotta go 
 I'm a come see ya (see ya) hey hey we put our hands 
 In da sky let 'em know dat we bout that 
 Cash flow... I need it on time I'm 
 Talkin' bank roll my money my money my money 
 Cash flow... I need it 
 On time I'm talkin' bank roll my money my money my money... 
 (Verse: Ace Hood) 
 And where my money young niggaz gotta have that 
 Rubber bands by the grands in a big bag 
 Pockets fat like I'm carrying a backpack 
 A couple grand for the louie band napsack 
 Understand I'm the man who you can't match 
 Moneyman minivan full of brown bags 
 Better grand anyman never top that 
 Cause money and the gat pop those straps 
 Getting loot in the top drop right back 
 I ain't playin' creep ya avenue and I'll blast 
 Bust shots like a new year day blast 
 And I ride all day like a buss pass 
 Grindin hard for the bread and the cash flow 
 Kick doors wave 4's where da cash go (where da cash go) 
 I'm trying to see it like a mutha fuckin' castro 
 Rubber bands in my pants and a swift bankroll 
 (Chorus: T-Pain) 
 I'll tell ya one thang don't play about mine 
 I be bangin' on your front door with da nine 
 I'm a come see ya (see ya) 
 I'm a come see ya (see ya) 
 I need all my dough not a dolla short 
 And if you don't have it den you gotta go 
 I'm a come see ya (see ya) hey hey we put our hands 
 In da sky let 'em know dat we bout that 
 Cash flow... I need it on time I'm 
 Talkin' bank roll my money my money my money 
 Cash flow... I need it 
 On time I'm talkin' bank roll my money my money my money...

 Big money in the dope hole 
 See the beamers when ya pull up in the dope home (my money)

 Running green nigga living like nino 
 Ridin' clean wax sittin' for the c note

 Momma dead broke daddy fucked up 
 I'm a make them come and hit me with the recoup 
 God dammnit I'm still in the dope spot 
 Why the fuck you think I pull up in a dope car 
 Gold shoes stepping out with a dope bitch cartel 
 So she gotta suck four dicks I d me v I p DJ khaled m o b 
 Girls so hot ace so cold takin' bets ace won't fold
