I'm just good 
 Can't you see what's up? 
 Good girl gonna fucking bad 
 I guess she fuck me good I guess she ask where the party at 
 She beautiful so she get away with it 
 And all of this is all amazing 
 Beautiful girl 
 No matter who you are 
 Rather I'm superstar I think you're ... 
 You know I love you girl 
 Is this one ... 
 Is this one ... 
 Is this one ... girl. 
 I think I met her by a year ago 
 Calish girl she was ... 
 Had a child bet 'em all work in... foe 
 ...Fine ain't lie hear me though 
 Soon walk around ...to my hate ... 
 She reclaim what is ... I say the name ... 
 Very conservative if I load that 
 Sweety jeans rocking jaze in the snap back 
 Yeah but I can see that she would kill a girl 
 See you how the nephews ... you'd better get it girl 
 And you the ship she don't' know yet 
 Turn it realgot a blossom with your mama ... 
 Cause all I wanna do is thank her 
 I'm using beautiful ... in the same verse 
 I swear I'm trippin' you just got me open 
 And hope we can get it ... 
 Beautiful girl 
 No matter who you are 
 Rather I'm superstar I think you're ... 
 You know I love you girl 
 Is this one ... 
 Is this one ... 
 Is this one ... girl. 
 And I just hope that got you motivated 
 That's cause your body got me cultivated 
 Seeing you're fine that's a loan I just can tolerated 
 And all your friends say on a doubt every conversation 
 Mad cause you smile them all on the daily bases 
 Tell me why they hate and everything is a... 
 I'm just searching for your love but I'll be very patient 
 True story has a fin before we start dating 
 Say she never heard beautiful so many times 
 Silly guys approaching with all wrong lines 
 That's a reason for being a single a long time 
 And all the roses I think the pleasure is all mine 
 Yeah women are beautiful in many ways 
 Comfort is to stay never let it to wipe away 
 What's a man without a woman I'm just here to say 
 Yeah I'm just here to say 
 Beautiful girl 
 No matter who you are 
 Rather I'm superstar I think you're ... 
 You know I love you girl 
 Is this one ... 
 Is this one ... 
 Is this one ... girl.
