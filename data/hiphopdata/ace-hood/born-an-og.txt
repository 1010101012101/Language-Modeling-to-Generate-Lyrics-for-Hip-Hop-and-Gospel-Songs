I wake up and got 4 or 5 bitches in the bed 
 Smokin' weed, drinkin' liquor by da keg 
 I was born an OG if y'ain't heard about me 
 I put 4 or 5 bullets in ya head 
 Yeah, Luda, as if the gilatene chopped off my noggin 
 I got my head gone, got the pedal to the metal 
 And my Lambo poppin' in the red zone, speedin' 
 Like keenen is breathin' heavin' and breathin' hard 
 But I roll with heathens that just, just don't seem to believe in God 
 I'll whip yo head boy, put ya body in the bottom of the ocean 
 Mean while Ludacris is in the MIA with Ace Hood somewhere smokin' 
 Got a pound of the purp and the smell on my shirt 
 So I'm lookin' like roll it up, I be swimmin' in a pool of blood 
 'Cause the AK super soke it up, ha, ha, ha, ah 
 Fuck that, I'ma come back with it like this 
 Come back with it, ha, ha, ha, ha 
 Nasty Ludacris on the track with it 
 Got enough ammo to blow you out of proportion 
 And put a muthafucka on his back with it 
 I'm so wrong, I'm so Gudda, I'm so dangerous, ain't I? 
 I'm so gone off these suckas but the flama's will bang ya 
 'Cause I'm a solid aima, the fat lady got a song to sang ya 
 Mean while I stashed all yo bricks in more hookers 
 Than a hundred airplane hangers 
 I'm so high, I'm so fly, that is a fuckin' shame 
 Smokin' weed by the bush with that kush 
 And you so fuckin' lame 
 I wake up and got 4 or 5 bitches in the bed 
 Smokin' weed, drinkin' liquor by da keg 
 I was born an OG if y'ain't heard about me 
 I put 4 or 5 bullets in ya head 
 I wake up and got 4 or 5 bitches in the bed 
 Smokin' weed, drinkin' liquor by da keg 
 I was born an OG if y'ain't heard about me 
 I put 4 or 5 bullets in ya head 
 In ya head nigga, Young Gudda, Ace Hood homie 
 And I'ma ball like a dawg and I'm never gone fall 
 You can call me jollin', baby in a Lamborghini drop top 
 And I can't stop myself from stuntin' lately 
 And I'm stickin' to my dollas that's my motto 
 You can follow and I'm holla tell 'em it's fuck you pay me
