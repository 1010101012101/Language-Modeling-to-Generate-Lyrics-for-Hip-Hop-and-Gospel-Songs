(Intro - Ace Hood) 
 Ace Hood, homie 
 Gutta 
 Gutta 
 Ace Hood 
 Brisco, let's go 
 (Chorus - Ace Hood and Brisco) 
 (Ace Hood) 
 Because I got my cash on check 
 My swag on check 
 Bitches all on my dick 
 And these niggas ain't know shit 
 Rolling on them thangs 
 Another one's next 
 Hater blockers is on, they can't tell me shit because 
 (Brisco) 
 Because I don't see y'all 
 Because I don't see y'all 
 Because I don't see y'all 
 Because I don't see y'all 
 Nigga get on my level! 
 (Verse 1 - Ace Hood and Brisco) 
 (Ace Hood) 
 A to the C to the E to the H double O D 
 Bitch I'm raised up in the streets 
 Keep it G-U-T-T-A 
 For my niggas serving yay 
 Moving weight and serving packages that pack it in the crate 
 We don't count that cash every duffle gets weighed 
 Big money I'm paid, bitch I'm feeling myself 
 You can tell I'm getting money Louis Vuitton belt 
 And I wish a nigga would make a move himself 
 (Brisco) 
 See I get money 
 It's coming out my ass 
 And I don't fuck with hoes if they ain't about cash 
 Opa Locka goon, four Chevys and a dirtbike 
 I open up my trap 
 But took it back on the first night 
 Catch me in a Porsche 
 Or maybe on the porch 
 And we don't get jailed because we don't go to court 
 Yeah, nigga stunting 
 Your homeboy fronting 
 Talking that shit but 
 He ain't about nothing 
 (Verse 2 - Ace Hood and Brisco) 
 (Brisco) 
 I'm looking for a hood rat, call her Stacy 
 She cuss real bad, and she steal from Macy*s 
 I want her so bad, please someone pace me 
 Try and say a hater will soon come hate me 
 Bocce boy, bocce boy, these chopps hit is bocce boy 
 Bag his ass up E-Class, keep the party going 
 Yes sir, I'm certified 3-0 
 Till I die, tell them niggas come and see po' 
 (Ace Hood) 
 And I'ma come see him blast like an airbag 
 Make his body bounce, bounce, twenty five shell count 
 Pussy nigga listen you don't listen you get hit with fifty missiles 
 Leave you living with the dead, understand that? 
 I got some bitches and niggas that wanna bandwag 
 I double up with the jewels and let my pants sag 
 A hundred stacks in the bag, now where the cash at? 
 Yes, I'm blind so you haters like a cataract 
 (Ace Hood and Brisco - Verse 3) 
 (Brisco) 
 What it do, what it is 
 See I don't talk to police and I don't play with kids 
 I'm home gutter, gangster, projects 
 I know the block hot, but I'ma open up regardless 
 (Ace Hood) 
 Yeah, and damn right that coupe going topless 
 Vacant on the I, we do a 105 
 Me and Bris about cash we let it blow in the skies 
 Not let's blow money, never had more money 
 (Brisco) 
 Now I'm the shit, believe that (Whoa!) 
 I know I got paper I just want a little more 
 I know you bitches talking, so just talk a little more 
 Because baby I'm me, and y'all niggas hoes 
 Let's go 
 (Ace Hood) 
 And I'm gone, my nigga you know I got them 
 See, I am just a product, receiving all profit 
 See niggas want to hate, tell them "Silly rabbit, stop it" 
 See, me and Bris stars outer space like Martians
