Yeah, all around the world 
 (Around the world) 
 I done been all around the world seen all kinds of girls 
 But ain't none like you 'cause you are wifey material 
 You know that I'm in love with a girl 
 But ain't none like you 'cause you are wifey material 
 Oh, oh, oh, wifey material 
 Oh, oh, oh, wifey material 
 Tjeah, I live my life like a vivid dream 
 Of living lavish I done perished of the triple beam 
 (Triple beam) 
 My momma told me but I couldn't see 
 So why you plot?, my economic mind to the streets 
 Ace, I tell you life is never promised if you fuck with him 
 You get fucked every night that's a promise 
 (Promise) 
 A nigga real let you're friends hatin' 
 Fuck them ho's bet me and you escape 
 (Escape) 
 And I ain't gotta talk it 'cause I live it, girl 
 I like to welcome you to my exquisite world

 But ain't none like you 'cause you are wifey material 
 You know that I'm in love with a girl 
 But ain't none like you 'cause you are wifey material 
 Oh, oh, oh, wifey material 
 Oh, oh, oh, wifey material 
 I wake up mornings and I picture what I've been through 
 Five siblings gotta live in three bedrooms 
 Now it's big cribs, whips and them blue pooch 
 Beautiful broads and they all wanna do who? 
 Ace Hood 
 Pleasure P to set the sex mood and once I sex you 
 Just forget the next dude beats I few lingerie see through 
 She say I'm so hood rubbing on my tattoo, you ever been to Cancun? 
 I can take you, I feelin' like B.I.G when he wrote juice 
 Fruit loop cush livin' like the chest mood 
 Yeah, they hate 'cause we doing they can't do

 But ain't none like you 'cause you are wifey material 
 You know that I'm in love with a girl

 Oh, oh, oh, wifey material 
 Oh, oh, oh, wifey material 
 Tjeah and I grind every 21st 
 Always love the day and pray to see the 21st 
 Kiss my mommas and I gotta go 
 Married to the dough all pre-nuptial 
 Ace, tough baby, know that it's a G-thang 
 Beat game while I'm taking off your G-string 
 (G-string) 
 Take a look into the pink frame we pick everything 
 Have it your way 
 I done been all around the world seen all kinds of girls 
 But ain't none like you 'cause you are wifey material 
 You know that I'm in love with a girl 
 But ain't none like you 'cause you are wifey material 
 Oh, oh, oh, wifey material 
 Oh, oh, oh, wifey material
