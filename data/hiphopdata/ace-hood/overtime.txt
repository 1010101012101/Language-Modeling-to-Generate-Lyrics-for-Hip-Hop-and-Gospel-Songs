Ace Hood, it's do or die, gotta go for it, overtime 
 Yeah 'cause it's now or never 
 I'ma put it on the line, I gotta win so I'm gonna bribe 
 Put it overtime, overtime, overtime, overtime 
 'Cause I got money on my mind, give me every penny, every dime 
 Put it overtime, overtime, overtime, overtime, overtime 
 'Cause it's now or never, put it over time 
 Well, I'm sittin' on the goal line, starin' at the game clock 
 Facing a hundred years, me and Jordan got the same shot 
 Carolina blue, California green 
 Jump for the white, getcho frilly sheets 
 Ace Hood, they go crazy when I'm in your city 
 Ace Hood, that's what they sayin' now in every city 
 I put my team first, it's never rehearsed 
 We the best franchise 'cause we squeeze first 
 I signed a life long deal to the G-co 
 Drafted outa high school then I hit my free throws 
 You see them free shows, we call them free throws 
 Now it cost 'em 20 stacks to witness me flow 
 It's do or die, yeah, gotta go for it, overtime 
 Yeah 'cause it's now or never 
 I'ma put it on the line, I gotta win so I'm gonna bribe 
 Put it overtime, overtime, overtime, overtime 
 'Cause I got money on my mind, give me every penny, every dime 
 Put it overtime, overtime, overtime, overtime, overtime 
 'Cause it's now or never, put it over time 
 Yeah, on the role with riches and diamond rings 
 Real niggers do real things 
 I say hangin' with the bitches is the song I sing 
 Real niggers do real things 
 I'm listenin' to block but it's a human being 
 If you're tryna win the trophy then you gotta do it big 
 Louis on every bag, bitches I keep it fly 
 We don't need a see the tag, we just see it and then we cop 
 Balling out of control, put it out on the line 
 I'm in the city with Khaled before I hit a triple dime 
 Now hold down onto your seats, I'm about to double mine 
 Ace Hood, Konvict and we put in overtime 
 It's do or die, yeah, gotta go for it, overtime 
 I'ma put it on the line, I gotta win so I'm gonna bribe 
 Put it overtime, overtime, overtime, overtime 
 'Cause I got money on my mind, give me every penny, every dime 
 Put it overtime, overtime, overtime, overtime, overtime 
 And I can't slow down for nothin', see I, gotta get overtime 
 'Cause I'ma stay on my grind, 'cause money stays on my mind 
 I feel like 24 hours just ain't enough for me 
 If you feel me put your hands up for me 
 This is over grind, I'm goin' for mine, I'm over mine 
 Because I'm putting overtime 
 I'ma put it on the line, I gotta win so I'm gonna bribe 
 Put it overtime, overtime, overtime, overtime 
 'Cause I got money on my mind, give me every penny, every dime 
 Put it overtime, overtime, overtime, overtime, overtime 
 Ace Hood, Akon, we the best one time
