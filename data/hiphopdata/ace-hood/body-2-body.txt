(Ace Hood) 
 Yeah, Ace Hood 
 What's up baby? 
 We the Best huh 
 So I had a few things in mind 
 And I was thinkin' uhm... 
 (Chris Brown) 
 Baby, you don't have to try to read my mind 
 Cause you know I wanna get it in 
 And tell me why would we just think about it 
 If you want it then I got it 
 We can be body to body 
 Body to body 
 I don't mean to rush you girl but, 
 We should be body to body 
 Body to body, body to body 
 (Ace Hood) 
 Uh, picture your body soaking, bath water 
 No panties on, come up out them leg warmers 
 Wrap up your hair, leave on your heels 
 Kissing you while I whisper, shawty how it feels 
 Let ya mind wonder, oh you're thinking dirty? 
 I was thinking you can ride me, Miss. Kentucky Derby 
 I dream about it, let's take advantage 
 My body on your body, hope that you can manage 
 Gotta moan it, damn-it, feels good 
 Pulling on her hair to let her know I'm still hood 
 Damn right, serve her the real 
 This year of the Ace, bet you that she know the deal 
 (Chris Brown) 
 Baby, you don't have to try to read my mind 
 Cause you know I wanna get it in 
 And tell me why would we just think about it 
 If you want it then I got it 
 We can be body to body 
 Body to body 
 I don't mean to rush you girl but 
 We should be body to body 
 Body to body, body to body 
 (Ace Hood) 
 Uh, so quit ya contemplating, skip this conversation 
 By the way you biting on your lip just gave me confirmation 
 Was that Chanel 5? Very sexy fragrance 
 Are those your real eyes 
 Can tell you're partially asian 
 But I know your body got me focused, I'm just so sedated 
 And I guarantee I do you better than your past-n-latest 
 Body to body, wet as Dasani 
 Bet if I hit your spot, I'll make you tsunami 
 Change up the sheets, no time to sleep 
 Asked what she's thinking, she replied that I'm a beast 
 Yeah she replied that I'm a beast 
 Got it locked between the sheets and even in the streets 
 (Chris Brown) 
 Baby, you don't have to try to read my mind 
 Cause you know I wanna get it in 
 And tell me why would we just think about it 
 If you want it then I got it 
 We can be body to body 
 Body to body 
 I don't mean to rush you girl but 
 But we should be body to body 
 Body to body, body to body 
 We're making love on the floor, you're kissing my tattoos 
 I'm pulling your hair you scream my name 
 Call me daddy, baby I got you 
 Go get in your bed and lay down, down, down 
 Girl, are you ready, 'cause I'm gonna want you face down, down, down 
 Right now, you fuckin' with a real freak! 
 Baby, you don't have to try to read my mind 
 Cause you know I wanna get it in 
 And tell me why would we just think about it 
 If you want it then I got it 
 We can be body to body 
 Body to body 
 I don't mean to rush you girl but 
 We should be body to body 
 Body to body, body to body
