(Chorus - Schife) 
 Spent thirty in the mall 
 Going loco with the cake 
 Five cars sitting tall 
 Going loco with the cake 
 Ten on some Cali' bud 
 Going loco with the cake 
 Then I hit the strip club 
 Going loco with the cake 
 Glittered up my wrist 
 Going loco with the cake 
 Went and Guccied up my bitch 
 Going loco with the cake 
 Repping five with the pimps 
 Going loco with the cake 
 I put on my whole team 
 Going loco with the cake 
 (Verse 1 - Ace Hood) 
 Aye 
 You don't want to start a food fight 
 Get your attitude right 
 Before I put this cake all in your face and have your crew like 
 Who that is? Ace Hood 
 You ain't know that's Ace Hood? 
 Ask around in every project they say that boy face good 
 Put the Range Rover on them 24's I skate good 
 Especially with the paper ice, all over my Ace Hood 
 Chain, fuck a dummy I need hoes to educate me 
 Good brain! 
 Take the package up the temple come back home and get, paid! 
 Seven days up out the week a nigga got to get, paid! 
 Quit your hating, get on your job, and hoe you can get, paid! 
 Like Ace, like who? Like me nigga 
 That's why every bitch you trying to fuck like me nigga 
 (Verse 2 - Ace Hood) 
 I rep this pot like it's chemistry 
 Got an F in chemistry 
 Took the white and turned it green 
 Now that's what I call chemistry 
 That's what I call, Enterprise 
 Call my work, The Enterprise 
 Twenty junkies beaming up to Scotty in my Enterprise 
 Smoking in my spaceship, floating through the galaxy 
 They calling me a shooting star, leave hoes off through your calvery 
 Gangsters, goons, and killers only niggas on my salary 
 They all got charges pending 
 Murder, burglaries, and batteries 
 Niggas trying to battle me, end up finding they tragedy 
 Laided out on the floor and breathing fast and looking up at me (Up at me) 
 Play me in your Chevy when you scrambling 
 Ruthless than a motherfucker with hundred grand on me 
 (Verse 3 - Ace Hood) 
 Aye 
 You can call me Mister Cash Flow 
 Money out the asshole 
 Thugging getting paper, what you think that Louis bag hoe? 
 Pull up in that stoopid whip 
 Hundred for the stoopid wrist 
 Stoopid this, stoopid that, loco with the money bag 
 Lamborghini Murcielag', girl you got to stoopid that 
 Gucci this, Louis that, riding with them paper tags 
 And my bitch she bad as hell, Juicy, Louis, Gucci bag 
 All my niggas love to swag, Bentleys, Phantoms back to back 
 Twenty grand I'll show you going low and tell them holler back 
 Pain you a dummy, blow about thirty on a whip and then 
 Swing on them 30's 
 I drop the top on them verties 
 Switch lanes, on them haters, I'm throwing paper to make them spend
