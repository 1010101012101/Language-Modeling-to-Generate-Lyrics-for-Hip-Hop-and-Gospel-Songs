Mama can finally smile 
 Pray for a better life 
 Just to see me to the tuff nice 
 Spoke to my mama just the other day 
 I told her only god can make a way 
 I'm here in... runnin' down to face 
 So she fed up with the struggle each and every day 
 My step... in the way, too many biz my mama gotta pay 
 But know I got it no doubt about it no penny grave 
 They tell us about it my... made 
 And I just wep me like under... 
 I pray that one day you see me speak at the vma's 
 And me and... back back in the ladies things 
 ... Read the fucking game 
 Hard work pays off go and get it days off 
 I know they all remember me they recognize the name 
 I was that... my niggas deal... carry in the flame 
 And everybody say I wouldn't take a walk a shame 
 Though about you haters when I got my pinky... 
 Live your reality and used to be a gray dream 
 Hustle hard 8 day getting money five way 
 Say no shit just a different way, out to try to get it 
 I'm out here get the pay 
 I'm out here get the pay 
 I'm out here get the pay 
 Mama can finally smile

 Bad bitch top down 24 see a... on the whip now 
 I'm just living life hope you do the dame 
 Keep a bust real nigga so I never change 
 Look at me now, look at 'em in, I'm from the... 
 I'm taking... I'm making... now I'm thinking big 
 I got what... niggas do to win see we the best the less 
 Is war time hope you niggas brough the vest 
 Got plenty women we're from the... 
 Fuck e on that gucci... she come in a minute 
 You're loving... I'm just tryin' to will it 
 ... My nigga... life... I'm from the bottom came from the mud 
 Was given nothing no love no... big smoke, no hubs back again showin off 
 I'm the definition in the blowin' up 
 Look in my niggas eyes better know what's on us 
 You'd better know what's on us 
 'Cause I gotta sowing up

 'Cause I gotta sowing up 
 Mamma can finally smile
