Now I dun been so talked about and laughed at, 
 Doubted by my family, 
 Reachin' for them favors but nobody giving hand backs, 
 Came back, anthrax, spitting like a automac' 
 This is where it started at, way before that We The Best, 
 I was back in Deerfield, giving momma heart attacks, 
 Calling but no answer she jus wonder where her son was at, 
 I was in the studio, you was moving work and blow, 
 I was thinkin' bigger shit, they just want some 24?s, 
 Me I'm dreaming millionaire, I don't think they hear me though, 
 Slidin' with my brother them, what you think that rental fo' 
 Livin' at my momma house, tellin' me to watch my mouth, 
 Workin with that 9 to 5, hated it without a doubt, 
 F-k that job and left it there, met with DJ Khaled them 
 Couple months I'm outta here broward county pioneer, 
 Walking with no kinda feel, passed up on them scholarships, 
 Mr. Broward county in the flesh remember I am him, 
 And I play the game how I'm 'posed to got my name all on Them posters I ain't boastin I'm jus' stating facts, 
 And I'm taking over f-ck you loners, 
 Tell yo owner I pulled over like my Rover may have caught a flat 
 I am f-cking back, like yo spinal cord, 
 All you lames extinct, to many dinosaurs, 
 Flow is super sick, I'm talkin' herpey sores 
 Biggest shit in years, I'm talkin' jersey shores, 
 Ya, and like a cheeto I remain the same, 
 Gotta let the world know wat my f-ckin name, 
 That's why I hustle like I'm ten of y'all, 
 And they don't believe me check my protocol 
 I'm mista, keep a bad bitch, Louis V frames 
 I jus' hope you get the picture 
 Man a nigga starvin marvin and no time to bargain, 
 None you niggas pose a threat, y'all ain't in my target, 
 Swingin' to the top spot you can call me Tarzan, 
 Walking over lames, they can clearly play the carpet, 
 Hot shit, arson, murder scene caution, 
 They don't want it with the kid, gladly get abortion, 
 See you niggas pocket watching, you won't get a portion, 
 Think I'm really slippin tho, bullets to yo organ, 
 Yeah you niggas supa ducks yeah I'm talkin' oregon, 
 Ride the beat no choruses, like I'm in some foreign shit, 
 Kayko told me murder dat, so I went and bodied this, 
 Ballin like I'm by the rim, I deserve a scholarship, 
 This is where I'm at today, you should come and follow him, 
 I be on my planet tho, come and see my mother ship, 
 F-ck the game and let it go, there is no more sportsmanship, 
 3 years with that We The Best, sorry I don't see the rest, 
 I don't care who comin' next, you won't see me break a sweat, 
 Better than yo next effects, greater than yo thoughts can get, 
 It's me I am in the flesh, and this as good as it can get, 
 Man you niggas never pose a threat.
