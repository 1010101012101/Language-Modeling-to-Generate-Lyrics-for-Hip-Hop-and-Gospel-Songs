Take a look at me now, I'm from the gutta but I made it, I made it to the top of the world, 
 Nothin' holdin' me down, I told them haters I would make it, I made it to the top of the world 
 Congradulations all you fakers as you see I graduated, heres a favour for you haters, kiss my anus boiiii, I made it out the ghetto, I made it out the gutta, but still I keep the street and now I'm hot as every summer. They said I couldn't do it, but who are they to call, I started rappin' and ended chances of playin' ball. And now the doubted, but young is sproutin above them all, straight out the ? county gutta skippin metaposs. No homo I keep it solo but I will never fall, now every call I get the money is so involved, 2 stacks of betta is easy cheddar to hit the mall. I get the money to throw 'em so every day I ball, 
 And yes I made it, you can't mistake it, I know they hate it, they see my face in the paper next to they rappin' favorites, I am so amazing I am no one like I'm in the matrix. And I made it mama, and don't stress your problems imma get us out tha, forget the drama that people holla just follow godda. And he will lead you right through the problems I promise mama, and I swear that to the day I parish, tell 'em khaled I will bury every nescesary cat who said I wouldn't homie. Look at me now yeah I'm laughin' at you non believers, screamin gutta while I'm ballin err fuckin' season, I use to pass my CD me and fo fifth in 80, I use to bag 'em to listen but they were not believing, GO 
 And as I rap I create a classic, who would imagine, that I would inherit all the traits to be the greatest homie, the world is mine and everything, let's get the money, see tony montana said it best, yes it's quoted truly, so add this song to your list of greatest and classic movies, and imma roll the credits, just in second, just get this message, shout out to everyone who supported me from past to present, and I wanna thank khaled because without him there will be no sessions, and I wanna thank fam 'cause wit them they taught me this lesson, and I wanna thank god 'cause without him there will be no message, and I wanna thank all of my fans 'cause they are a blessing, this for BET reference, I got my speech ready,
