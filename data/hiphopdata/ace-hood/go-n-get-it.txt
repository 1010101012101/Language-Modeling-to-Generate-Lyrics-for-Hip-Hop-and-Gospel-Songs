I do it 
 Blood, sweat, tears 
 Ace Hood 
 I do it 
 Another day, another dollar 
 Every 24 I'm thinking money in the power 
 Bills too, money runnin' low 
 Plus my cousin lost his mind and had an overdose 
 Way too many problems 
 Got me stressed up 
 What you're doing? 
 You've got seven days to move out 
 Go n' get it, go n' get it, go n' get it 
 I'm out here chasing green 
 Go n' get it, go n' get it, go n' get it 
 Get it by any means 
 Money the root of evil, guess I'm the devil then 
 Bag full of dead faces like Afghanistan 
 Honey, pay your better, custom made Beretta 
 How about that pay for cheddah? How about that Beamer leather? 
 Tell 'em get a load of this bezzle 
 Bitch face, gonna rock some pebbles 
 Don't grind, and a nigga don't shine 
 Fuck y'all, gotta get mine 
 Big dog, big money, you're mine 
 Runnin' light to the sun uprise 
 Money, it never sleeps 
 Got bags up under my eyes 
 Just know I gotta get it 
 Mama very sickly 
 Plus I'm expecting twins 
 That's just what heaven sent me 
 God fearing nigga 
 'Cause I am in the flesh 
 Hope I don't let my people starve 
 God bless my soul to rest

 Go n' get it, go n' get it, go n' get it

 Go n' get it, go n' get it, go n' get it 
 Need it by any means 
 Okay, now ridin' 'round with that rocket 
 Niggas try to steal my flow, though 
 Thank you for the promo 
 We're the best deal be that logo 
 Okay back up on to my dough shit 
 Slidin' on to 'em 2-6 
 Lights do, hard to know 
 Baby sees, thus ring 
 Nigga just know that I'm out-shield 
 Thought my night was outfield 
 Won't shoot niggas' pussy 
 Yeah I'm talkin' pap smear 
 Don't doubt me as my day go 
 Tryna get my mom off payroll 
 Wanna put her in that Benzo 
 Get kinda hard when the funds' low 
 I'm sick and tired of her cryin' 
 Tired of nickel and dimes 
 Look at her in her eyes 
 But I know your son gonna rot 
 'Cause I'm a God-fearin' nigga 
 'Cause I am in the flesh 
 Not gonna let my people starve 
 God bless my soul to rest
