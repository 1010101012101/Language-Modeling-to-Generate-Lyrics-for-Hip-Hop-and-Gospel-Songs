Well alright 
 Only if you niggas could walk in my shoes homie 
 This is "The Statement" 
 Look in my eyes there's nothing mediocre 
 Can't see the beast into my inner soul ah 
 Welcome to my building, come and meet the newest owner 
 Out a coma, I'm a different type of organ donor 
 Different breed, come and see why they be hating on him 
 Hundred thousand dollar jewels, need a sweater thermal 
 Bitch I'm paranormal, hot as fucking Arizona 
 Rep my city, play the bass like I was Sammy Sosa 
 Uh, I'm taking over, that's my inner motive 
 Smell the money odor, trying to meet my monthly quota 
 Dopest nigga around, minus all that baking soda 
 Heavy roller, hear me motor, Giovanna floaters 
 Sick and tired of being cried, now that shit is over 
 Hot as early morning Folgers, I'm with twenty soldiers 
 Blacking out, just like the album, deuces up to H.O.V.A. 
 Brush the hate up off my shoulders, welcome me again 
 Got my CD on my collar like a violin 
 Broward County, nigga run it like a Titan 
 Newest artist with a hundred grand investment 
 Gave my bitch a couple bands for enhancement 
 Ha, so what the fuck them niggas talking about? 
 I am the only shit they talking about 
 A lot of rumors but I'm getting guap 
 Busting bladders, laughing at them as I see the top 
 Ha, rather backing me to the fucking block 
 I swear they hate when niggas getting guap 
 But I'm addicted to my chain and watch 
 Balling like I'm Chris Bosh, never would I stop 
 Uh, I see them staring with they looking ass 
 Quick to judge a nigga, haters wish I'm doing bad 
 Got me mad so I went and got a paper tag 
 Like the Benz but I went and did another Jag' 
 Yeah, and I am young and arrogant as hell 
 Do it for the real niggas, hope for posting bail 
 I welcome y'all to "The Statement" 
 Only trill niggas play it in your tape deck 
 Uh, and that's word to my only city 
 Only fucking if she got a pretty set of titties 
 Told my niggas that I got to stay fucking with me 
 Murder everything, make Obama come and get me 
 Bang, bang from a clip that hold a buck sixty 
 This is my world, you are just a bug in it 
 Dead body if I ever put them slugs in it 
 You don't really want to fuck with it 
 I built this motherfucker from the floor 
 Twenty two and getting money all a nigga know 
 The next big shit I put that on my nigga Fo 
 I'ma show you to the front door
