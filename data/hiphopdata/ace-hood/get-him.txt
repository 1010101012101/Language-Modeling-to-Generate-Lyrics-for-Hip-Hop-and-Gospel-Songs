You ain't coming around here talking all that shit 
 Talking about look at all them bricks 
 I'ma have to come around your way 
 Nigga I'm real you all too fake 
 Ain't no pistol where your mama stay 
 Act like I don't know where you lay 
 Better act right before I get uptight 
 Act up I'ma let the automatic spray 
 Get them 
 Boy there he go 
 Get them 
 Boy there he go 
 Get them 
 Blocker, blocker, blocker, blocker 
 Boy there he go 
 Get them 
 Boy there he go 
 Get them 
 Boy there he go 
 Get them 
 Blocker, blocker, blocker, blocker 
 Boy there he go 
 Hold up, where they at? 
 Khaled, dog let me get them 
 Gun cocked, where his children? 
 No talk, time to get them 
 Fake niggas going to make me kill them 
 Make his body shiver like he naked in a river 
 Matter of fact I'ma leave him in the river 
 Come and get him when it's winter, nigga holler back 
 I'm gutter, I told you that 
 Roc boy, bitch Hova back 
 Tell you we moving them slabs of crack 
 See nigga you a lie like Pac is back 
 Bend you niggas all cramped, and your homie won't last 
 See you something like paper tags 
 Don't make me slide them MACs 
 To save one blast and get his ass 
 Now let me get him when I walk up in the place 
 Put the pace in your face, tell them give me that cake 
 Fuck niggas and I really don't think 
 That I know where they lay, duct tape they face 
 Pop pop, unload that K 
 Then we leave them and we find them in a couple of days 
 Pussy niggas know where you lay 
 Acting like I don't know where you stay 
 Running out your mouth that you niggas too fake 
 Telling other niggas that you rule them thangs 
 (What?) 
 You ain't about that lie 
 (Huh?) 
 You ain't got no stride 
 (Nah) 
 You really grind 
 Leave them in the streets till the D-boys find them 
 Dumb niggas and the honking on the grind in the middle of the town 
 We gon' g-g-get them 
 Now who am I motherfuckers want to know 
 When I pull up in a Rover, they know that it's over 
 Big hold and your body like coasters 
 Creep, creep we deep with soldiers 
 Black hoes that'll carry that toaster 
 Hot head now they calling me Folgers 
 But still creep in Adidas with them heaters and them meters 
 When I see where your family at 
 Pop pop, just call me Ace 
 Slump niggas I'ma call you dead 
 Click clack, now your T-shirt red 
 Hand them a tampon 
 No batteries included, know that the clip be hands on 
 And I take your man's arm 
 Leave his body slumped in the damn yard
