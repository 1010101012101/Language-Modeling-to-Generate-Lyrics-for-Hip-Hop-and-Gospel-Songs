(Chorus - Sean Kingston) 
 I'm addicted to this lifestyle 
 Blowing all my cash, in the strip club, trying to find me some ass 
 I'm addicted to this lifestyle 
 Shorty I can't change because that's just who I am 
 I'm addicted to this lifestyle 
 Buying four cars, buying out the mall, baby I'm a star 
 I'm addicted to this lifestyle 
 Shorty I can't change because that's just who I am 
 My conscience always say 
 Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go in the mall 
 Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go buy it all 
 Money ain't an issue, got to let you know this is who I am 
 (Verse 1 - Ace Hood) 
 Beachside view, white girl coupe, make believe top 
 Thought you seen the roof 
 White flip-flops, designer shades Louis 
 Big face blockers, Family Guy Stewie 
 I'm so addicted to it, my bitch she shop and touring 
 Them niggas wish to do her, just know she so manure 
 Who you lame fucks? 
 She got her game up, twenty four inches, Rover Range truck 
 This is my lifestyle, I live my life wow 
 Four or five bitches, pipe down 
 Money cars and clothes, all a nigga know 
 Dedicated flow 
 (Verse 2 - Ace Hood) 
 And I'm addicted to this life, I would never ever change it 
 Looking back on life, I swear to God that it's amazing 
 Riding in the flyest whips, now I'm eating Cajun 
 Thousand dollar Louis, couple hundred for the fragrant 
 Momma I made it, yes I did 
 Used to live with seven, three bed crib 
 But now I got my own, and now I'm riding chrome 
 These women love the money, so they becoming showns 
 I see these niggas hating, but they can't be what I'm on 
 Give my chick a couple stacks, then I ship her off to Rome 
 So bye-bye you, hit the mall and buy it all, baby it's the truth
