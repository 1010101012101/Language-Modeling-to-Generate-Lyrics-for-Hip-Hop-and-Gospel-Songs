Well all right 
 Turn me up 
 I try to told em 
 I try to told em 
 I do it 
 I do it 
 For the Sport 
 Oh yeah 
 Mo Money, Mo problems 
 Just bring me the paper 
 Yo Problems are petty 
 I'll tend to 'em later 
 I'm busy with business 
 No time for them bitches 
 I married my pistol 
 Devoted to snitches 
 I honor my father 
 Hope Lord'll forgive me 
 The devils be watchin 
 I'll send 'em ya message 
 I'm seein dead people 
 They thinking I'm trippin' 
 My wrist is a beast 
 I swear it's a villain 
 They say I'm crazy hoe 
 A couple screws loose 
 She schemin she fuckin' 
 What's this fruit juice 
 Bitch I'm hater proof 
 Soakin in that 22 
 Brand new 750 
 Let's see what it can do 
 I know I'm the shit 
 I hardly piss 
 My money in bags 
 ? 
 Get what I wish 
 Get what I want 
 It's we the best 
 Welcome home 
 I do it 
 Yeaaa I do it 
 And I do that shit well too
