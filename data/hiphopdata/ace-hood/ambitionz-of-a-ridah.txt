 Well I'm an intercity gangsta 
 D and D soldier 
 Venom is what pistols I spit them shells like a cobra 
 I don't give a fuck got that pistol grip in the hosta 
 I don't give a fuck got that pistol grip in the hosta 
 I don't give a fuck got that pistol grip in the hosta 
 Run up on yo house and shoot everyone on the sofa 
 Fuck negotiation I detinated the toster 
 I'm designated to hold up bout 50 count that and roll up 
 So I pull up I roll up an ounce of that California 
 50 rounds in the barrel you ready for rolla coasta 
 100 rounds in yo body you niggas ever approach us 
 Can't identify the local we have 'em looking like to-fu 
 EWWW! 
 Now that's nasty bitch niggas I'm fast speed 
 I'm on the level telescopes can't even see me 
 I am a rebel definition it describes me 
 I am a beast you see the features in the new breed 
 I'm all about that green guacamolli seaweed 
 And if you seem to have a problem you can see me 
 Just ask for the young beast in the east wing 
 See bry county is my city that's where I be 
 You ever play or disrespect and see an IV 
 Give you the D. and hope you pussys see the I.E. 
 You think I give a fuck, pussy boy try me 
 I leave you dead you'll see your head where your kins be 
 And when that letter reach sincerely Westley 
 I only fuck with thick bitches, that's my pet peeve 
 I'm gatorade cool, why you niggas sweat me?
