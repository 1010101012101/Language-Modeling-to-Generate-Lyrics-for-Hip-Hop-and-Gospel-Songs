I'm Mister Hood (Well alright) 
 Ahem 
 Okay, now welcome to my gutta show 
 Pockets on Geronimo 
 Creeping in that Beamer black, call it Maya Angelou 
 24's on the toe, cut the top like Amber Rose 
 And I'm with a bad bitch, you can see her camel toe 
 Tities like a cantaloupe, and she got that super throat 
 Man I'm getting laptop, call my bitch a Vaio 
 Beat it like she stole the dough 
 I made her catch the Holy Ghost 
 Deuces to you, adios, like Chris Brown and Tyga hoe 
 Damn, let me take it slow 
 Teach me how to dougie though 
 Fuck it, bags of money flow, I am such a nympho 
 Benjamin my kinfolk, we go back like '64 
 Talking about Nintendo, but I don't play no games hoe 
 I'm a movie role, you're an episode 
 I'ma live in color, like a Arsenio 
 So what the dealio? I get the member loaps 
 Six figure checks, that's when you're winning though 
 I'm an asshole, stuff it till the bag swole 
 I run my city homie, you can call me Castro 
 Hundred thousand dollar chain make my neck glow 
 So she suck it till she start to get a strep throat 
 I'm in beast mode, tell me what is info

 I say, get the Pepto 
 Okay, because, I be on some money, I be, I be on some money shit [X3]
