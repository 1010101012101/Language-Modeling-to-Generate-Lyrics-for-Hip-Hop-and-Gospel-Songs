Leave my heart to the ghetto 
 Rubber bands stuffed all in up 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah, get money 
 (Get money) 
 That's the motto, hustle all day 
 Then we do the shit tomorrow 
 I'm in the ghetto 
 (Ghetto) 
 I'm in the ghetto 
 (Ghetto) 
 Gotta get it 
 (Gotta get it) 
 That's the motto, live for today 
 You might never see Tomorrow 
 I'm in the ghetto

 See I went straight to the pros 
 Who done done it like me, breakup 
 The flow now they holla 'He a beast' 
 From the city where there's Killas and dealas 
 And street beef, and them crackas on the corner 
 Every avenue and place and my homies servin' hard 
 'Cause they livin' by the day, see I do it for my family 
 And hustled by the way, now I'm back up on the block 
 Ya see, I'm cooler than them othas 
 Certified colored sneakas, keep a fitted for the club 
 When I step out on the scene all them hoes be showin' love 
 They know I'm that dude that be ringin' through the block 
 Ace, Ace, Ace, Ace, yeah fool heard it right 
 I done been down to the bottom now I'm bound to see 
 The top, my hood 
 Leave my heart to the ghetto 
 Rubber bands stuffed all in up 
 Oh yeah, oh yeah, get money

 Ay, get me, get me 
 I got 'em a couple triple beams about an ounce of bakin soda 
 I Got that revenue that's hittin' colda than Sammy Sosa 
 [Unverified] ya' see growin' up, I seen alotta things 
 I weren't supposed so growin' up I lost alotta people 
 That were closa that's why I stay up on my grind 
 And only roll with soldiers, I hit the block 
 And serve 'em everything away from soda 
 Don't fuck without the soda, sellin' coke 
 Without the cola, my clientele is strictly rock 
 You can tell it by the odor, I keep that nino 
 With the mac hid underneath the sofa 
 So if you ridin' slngin' tricks I suggest a coma 
 Them pussy niggaz want me dead so I suggest and dopa 
 Leave my heart to the ghetto

 Ay, get me, get me 
 Yeah, I wake up in the ghetto tryin' dream a couple mill 
 I'm forced to get, momma shootin' up and poppin' pills 
 Daddy on the porch with no remorse he sittin' still 
 This be the city that never pity they would rather kill 
 I wipe my eyes and check my clientele who by yaself 
 I grab the pots and bakin' soda, yeah that odor smell 
 This be the hood, I got connections like a phone cable 
 So watch where you work 'cause a mistake can be fatal 
 'Cause crakas searchin' for that person tho I'm undertable 
 Can't find no witness, fuck them snitches 
 That get snitches popped, another day just talkin' on the block 
 With a million on my glock and a half off in my sock 
 Leave my heart to the ghetto
