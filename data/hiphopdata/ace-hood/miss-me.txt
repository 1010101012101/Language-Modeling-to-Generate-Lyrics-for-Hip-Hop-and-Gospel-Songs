Yeah 
 I'm Mister Hood 
 Okay I'm stacking dead presidents 
 Out there to my testament 
 Trying to get my money long, Yao Ming measurements 
 Sorry for my absences, Khaled they been asking him 
 Where your youngest problem been? 
 I been grinding trying to win 
 Studio, the money flowing, Rosay in them bucket Benz 
 Back up on my luck again, cut off some disloyal friends 
 Added me a bitch that's super thick I call her Medicine 
 I hate to exaggerate, her head is Excedrin 
 My flow is some syphilis, that's what makes me different 
 See me as your militant, yeah I'm on some other shit 
 Step back in this motherfucker, still in lead I'm resting it 
 May not have the hype but I'm the topic that they want to trend 
 I'm just doing me, that's the story, let the shit begin 
 Got two albums out and they ain't chilling or arresting it 
 Killing everything, come arrest me then 
 Bitches do each other, yeah they lesbians 
 Let them meet the dick, introduce a friend 
 Who would have thought that I'd do a double set of twins 
 They only fucking because the emblem on the whip a Benz 
 I'm coming for the top and sparing niggas, that depends 
 And they hear me talking about an album and they faces grin 
 You thought that hating would've worked, here we go again 
 And forgive me Lord if ever that I had to sin 
 I'm inspired off of life and not what a nigga did 
 Had visions of doing it big since the age of ten 
 I know they missed me I will never make them wait again 
 No disrespect but it was never safe to let me in 
 May 11 '88 I've been a problem since 
 Nigga 
 Tell me 
 Tell me what's really going on 
 Gutta back up in this bitch I'm ready, what's happening? 
 What's happening? 
 What's happening? 
 I'm back again 
 And I'm in a Benz 
 What's happening? 
 What's happening? 
 Gutta back up in this bitch, I'm ready 
 Indie what up nigga?
