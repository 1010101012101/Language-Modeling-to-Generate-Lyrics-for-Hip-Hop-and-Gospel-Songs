Take the ride with it, take the ride it 
 And it was just the other day everything was so good 
 Living like yesterday we were chillin' in the hood 
 Dreaming the bigger things that a younger niggas should 
 Wanna take care of the fam we just wishin that we could 
 Other day in the dollar stayin chasing the 
 Studios went for hours ...like a piranha 
 Only was... but loyalty with the honor 
 Grind round in the bubble for drama 
 Man I put that on my life that's my motha fucka dough 
 Anything I will... that's the nigga I will call 
 Just don't need come and running with that shit clear 'em all 
 Talking he play me and 
 Brothers turn like we ain't done it all 
 They went then in the studio that's when I got the cope 
 And it was all night when I lost ym dough till these days 
 I love my niggas see the pain still remain 
 No you watching from heaven now for you nigga came 
 So I tell you that you lane show you I'll never change 
 Still remain my nigga... 
 Don't get a I'ma push my love 
 Few head it so too long 
 I got more circle oh yes you trust 
 Me and my dogs all we got is us 
 Poor little nigga get about the 
 My niggas in the so the sky is 
 But I'll be got the money, the power and the fame 
 Shit don't change now we're running memory lane yeah 
 Is just me and my doughs runnin' down 
 Memory lane and when we lie 
 Is just me and my niggas we're runnin' down memory lane 
 Got memory lane, talk about runnin' down memory lane... 
 And I just gotta keep it real I'm telling you how I feel 
 Talking before the deal when I was back in the field 
 Nigga we used to chill let's my nigga dale 
 And in the school let's do it for a sale 
 We visit in this crib a couple days and we bale 
 In a couple of clubs and a couple of girls got damn my nigga 
 In the motha fucker days lord just tell em 
 Why you had to take my dough 
 They just wanted this car, they just wanted to bowl 
 They just wanted to leave frightened by wha he saw 
 I was off in the room waiting my nigga call 
 When it's the last time that we would even talk 
 I told 'em to be safe in the my dough 
 A acouple hours later got an unexpected call 
 My homie he was crying I knew that it was bad 
 He told me damn gone, you're lying at your ass 
 I call it cell phone but nobody hit 'em back 
 They say that he was shot down to make it right 
 He died on the scene that's when I hit my knees 
 Begging the lord please heavenly father please 
 So listen t the dream tell me how could it be 
 Probably because of me, my homie wanted to see 
 Then a couple years ago when I lost my dough 
 It's tears till this day it's tears continue to foe 
 I love my nigga see the pain still remain 
 Now you watching from heaven I'm falling nigga 
 So watch out that your name is show you I'll never change 
 But that shit on my chain is like a flame... 
 Don't get a I'ma push my love 
 Few head it so too long 
 I got more circle oh yes you trust 
 Me and my dogs all we got is us 
 Poor little nigga get about the 
 My niggas in the so the sky is 
 But I'll be got the money, the power and the fame 
 Shit don't change now we're running memory lane yeah 
 Is just me and my doughs runnin' down 
 Memory lane and when we lie 
 Is just me and my niggas we're runnin' down memory lane 
 Got memory lane, talk about runnin' down memory lane... 
 Gone but never forgot it 
 I had to live my life...
