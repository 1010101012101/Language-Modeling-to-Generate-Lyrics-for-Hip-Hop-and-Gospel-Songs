Hey, ever since I can remember I been balling like a bitch 
 Private plane, champagne, bitches gettin' switched 
 Ever since that money came, they been on the D 
 Them fine supermodels always in up on my lease 
 What is he in for, fuck what that pussy cost 
 I blow up 20 thousand enemies just to piss them off 
 Bitch, I'm here to set it off, I'm here to set it off

 You niggas buy the bar, I buy the club out, My condo on the beach 
 Call it my club house, LMAO, what the fuck they hating for 
 Stay in some sneakers that don't drop until the mouth's out 
 Every time I ride I keep my nine, I'm talking Romo 
 Niggas runnin' they mouth, I get to snapping like a photo 
 You fall in love with all these bitches, that's a no-no 
 You pillow-talking with these hoes, you's a homo, stick to the G code

 If I'm spending money, she officially my freak ho 
 And I keep them thangs, they go wherever that we go
