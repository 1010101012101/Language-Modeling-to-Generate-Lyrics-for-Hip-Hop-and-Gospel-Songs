(Chorus - R. City) 
 We come from a city where the young die 
 So why don't we get to use and put'cha guns high 
 About to lose that's the reason why we must try 
 The streets hot from the night till the sunrise 
 Ooh wahoooo, ooh (And this is what it sounds like) 
 Ooh wahoooo, ooh (Came up from the ground like) 
 (Verse 1 - Ace Hood) 
 Pummy yummy yummy, mom addicted to money 
 Grab a clip of them hundreds, and half a ounce of that scummy 
 Ready to hit the block try to seek them coming for that tummy 
 If I don't make it home tell my momma to pray for me 
 I'ma get it because I got it, came up from the bottom 
 Pussy nigga get shot up, so shut up and give me profit 
 Niggas they want me dead and I swear that there ain't no stopping 
 I'ma go out and get it, just watch me pop off your socket 
 Play the eighth for you haters, they see me on corner trapping 
 We the Best that's the lesson I'll take you pussies to college 
 Imagine me I'm gutta, now be the best it's of Heaven 
 I swear that till I perish I keep these pussies in panic whaa 
 (Verse 2 - Ace Hood) 
 Now watch me move through the city, gutta be my religion 
 Only vision to get it is take it without a witness 
 They say they want me dead and it's fuck them that's my decision 
 (Fuck them) Fuck them with middle fingers 
 Them pumps in the penitentiary, walk the block with this energy 
 Give a mug at my enemies, tell them who they 'posed to be 
 Hang them up like a poster be, play them like Monopoly 
 Till the end of my time I be G-U-T-T-A, Mister H-Double-O-D the prodigy 
 Tell them they can follow me, only cabbage and celery 
 Getting money heavily, smoking up on that broccoli 
 Ain't no vegetarians, play with me and you burger meat 
 Better have a pass to hit my streets with the currency, nigguh 
 (Verse 3 - R. City) 
 Live from the ghetto we be re-e-al 
 People only recognize the re-e-al 
 Cops hate because we don't sque-e-l 
 But we don't give a fuck about how they fee-e-l 
 See ain't nobody stopping with, tell them fosie back oh with 
 (Incomprehensible) What them blockers say 
 Let them know we do not play 
 Taking over soon some day, (Incomprehensible)
