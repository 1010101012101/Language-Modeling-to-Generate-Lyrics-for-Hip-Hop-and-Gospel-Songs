Ooh na na 
 What's my name 
 Ooh na na 
 What's my name 
 Ooh na na 
 What's my name 
 Ooh na na 
 What's my name 
 Ooh na na 
 What's my name 
 What's my name 
 What's my name 
 I'm on top 
 Missionary 
 Say my name 
 Three times 
 Like bloody mary 
 And I'll be there 
 In a flesh girl 
 Love it when i 
 Use my tongue 
 As a gesture 
 Just to 
 Let you know 
 My taste buds 
 Look nice 
 Now I wonder 
 Do you taste good 
 And I mean that 
 In the best way 
 Say my name 
 Like god 
 On a Sunday 
 Champagne 
 Set the mood right 
 No clothes 
 Leave your panties 
 On my nightlight 
 Looking for the plumber 
 I can lay the right pipe 
 No keyboard 
 Shawty just 
 The right type 
 Plus you outta this world 
 You so sci-fi 
 I'm just being real 
 Shawty tell me 
 Why lie 
 I bet the neighbors 
 Know my name 
 And you know why 
 Yeah you know how 
 Specially when you 
 Scream out
