Ace Hood (Aye, get them up) 
 Gutta (Aye, get them up) 
 (Aye, get them up) chea 
 (Aye, get them up) Gutta, Gutta, hey 
 I got my drop top rolling and I'm heading to the mother land 
 Gripping on that steering wheel, passenger's a duffel bag 
 Hundred in the Louis, don't confuse me with that other cat 
 Engine in the trunk jack, push it like a super pack 
 Automatic button pad, just to keep the top back 
 Ruby red insides, Lamborghini fruit snacks 
 .22, that's what I shoot, you know them bitches got a MAC 
 Back to the back of the 'Lac incase them pussy niggas wanna jack 
 Know I keep that .45, turn you into Cabbage Patch 
 Hit you right between the eyes and leave you like an alley rat 
 Hundred for the bracelet, attract them I'm like a magnet 
 Hit them with the gutter swag, swinging with the Louis rag 
 Say I maybe gave a damn but I never gave a fuck 
 Rep your city like a G then put your middle fingers up 
 I got the Eastside rolling, and the Westside holding 
 Southside rolling with me, and the Northside gon' 
 Get them up (Aye, get them up) [x7] 
 You rep your city nigga, gon' throw it up 
 And it go, eenie meenie mini mo, catch me slipping never though 
 Know I keep that full clip, come and get your super soak 
 Call me Mister Cinemax, shoot you like a movie role 
 Hundred on the highway, let's see how fast the coupe can go 
 New edition fit the kid, they ship the shit from England 
 Catch me in the foreign whip, climbing like the Ring-A-Lings 
 Yes, I'm on some other shit, don't know who you fucking with 
 Yes, I keep that .45, you better keep a body guard 
 Benz is in the parking lot, so you know the block is hot 
 Tell them we don't give a shit and motherfuck the other side 
 Bitch you know I'm born to ride, H.B. on some murder minds 
 Open up the suicide doors, call it homicide 
 I got my black flag swinging, and I'm banging on some gutter shit 
 Just got me a spaceship, took it from the government 
 White on white drop top, call that bitch the Cool Whip 
 Had to blow the brains out, yeah I keep it ruthless 
 Know you niggas mad but tell them haters I does this 
 Better quit that fussing, don't know what's in the pulpit 
 .45's a motherfucker, hit you and your cousin 
 Think I give a damn, but I never gave a fuck 
 Got that oven heated up, and bitch you looking like lunch 
 Take them heaters to your gut like it's a million uppercuts 
 Then I dip off in the cut, and throw it up, who give a fuck? 
 Got that vodka in my cup, bring my gangster to the front, what's up? 
 Gutta
