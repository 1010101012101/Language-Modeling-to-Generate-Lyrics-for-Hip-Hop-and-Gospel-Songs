Ace Hood, Rosay 
 We the fucking best, Maybach 
 It's so incredible 
 I do it for the thugs and the motherfucking gangstas 
 I do it for the strippers and the bitches put their ass up 
 I do it for the haters that them never put their hands up 
 I do it for the hustlers and this bitch throwing their grams up 
 Nigga, get nigga, get money nigga 
 Get money nigga, get money nigga 
 I'm like fresh outfit, blunts stay lit 
 And a nigga out in bout who don't buck a shit 
 Yeah I gave you a classic in my debut 
 Cashflow for the hoes I bought 
 (Straight to) 
 You wanna ride you can't be acting like Dre foo' 
 N.W.A, I bet you Ace played you 
 Hollywood, Hollywood, I see the big lights 
 And I'm with my big homie, Ricky, nigga, yeah right 
 Every minute that my heart pump blood 
 Fuck what you heard, momma raised a fucking thug 
 Money on my mind, imagine what's up in the trunk 
 And it get 10-to-life that's why I'm driving slow as fuck 
 On the other ridges feeling like a billionaire 
 A got a couple mill, a couple more an' I'm really there 
 Haters talk around me fuck 'em like I really care 
 When we handle all our business, sorry, they were never there 
 I do it for the thugs and the motherfucking gangstas 
 I do it for the strippers and the bitches put their ass up 
 I do it for the haters that them never put their hands up 
 I do it for the hustlers and this bitch throwing their grams up 
 Nigga, get money nigga, get money nigga 
 Get money nigga, get money nigga 
 Money ain't a thing I remain blinged up 
 Hundred on the chain, bitch, I think I'm King Tut 
 A nigga, young and rich, I feel I can't be touched 
 Fourty stacks for these shades, no, I can't see much 
 Unless it be the dollars, still talking cash flow 
 Thousand dollar bill, President Fidel Castro 
 Nigga with a attitude .50 and a mac-10 
 Ross cool as Ice Cube, dicky and the black chef 
 I'm in a heli chopper staring at the boat docks 
 Good weather, good weather means more flux 
 Look in my eyes, you can tell I'm seeing so clear 
 I get them bitches a prison an' feeling no fear 
 More money means more Louis, carry on 
 When I touch your city you should see how hoes' carry on 
 Bitch, what's my name? 
 Ace fucking Hood, ain't a damn thang change us 
 I do it for the thugs and the motherfucking gangstas 
 I do it for the strippers and the bitches put their ass up 
 I do it for the haters that them never put their hands up 
 I do it for the hustlers and this bitch throwing their grams up 
 Nigga, get money nigga, get money nigga 
 Get money nigga, get money nigga 
 Shit, shit and I'm a getting money ass, nigga 
 Fast with the duffle bags with the cash in it 
 White squares that's equivalence of mo dough 
 I hear my nigga, Ricky, selling on my promo 
 I make it rain hoe better wear your poncho 
 Just hit me on my TMO, I get you mo slow 
 The good life beats side of my condo 
 You know the name ask Jermaine on cut though 
 Wooh, you talking funny, but you fucking with the franchise 
 I decide how much you form the shit we let ride 
 I gave niggas your first startup 
 Showed you how to dress, made the hood be a part of 
 Maybe I should have kept my guard up 
 It's all good, need a hit, hit the guard up 
 Now you shit looking garbage 
 You's a rat, never build for this mob shit 
 I do it for the thugs and the motherfucking gangstas 
 I do it for the strippers and the bitches put their ass up 
 I do it for the haters that them never put their hands up 
 I do it for the hustlers and this bitch throwing their grams up 
 Nigga, get money nigga, get money nigga 
 Get money nigga, get money nigga
