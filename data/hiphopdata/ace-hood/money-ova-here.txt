Fresh Louis V. jeans and a fitted cap 
 A brand new old school with the top back 
 See ain't another getting money so clear 
 We got money over here, kick it with a millionaire 
 Because I look like money, I smell like money 
 My swag one hundred, system full of that scummy 
 I ball like a dawg seven days of the week 
 They don't get it like this, tell them get like me 
 We got money over here, we got money over here 
 We got money over here, we got money over here 
 See you chilling with a lame baby he ain't got change 
 Ain't no money over there, kick it with a millionaire 
 Fresh on the scene a hundred grand in the jeans 
 Bet you can't get these, spent a grand for the Visa 
 Let my pants hang and you know I'm on lean 
 Rolling with some O.G.'s, and they all tote beams 
 I'm the man in my city tell them get like me 
 I'm the man in the club blowing stacks every week 
 Ask your chick about the kid bet she wanna do me 
 And I let her put the donk, plus the stacks and the ki's 
 Give her drank in a Louis V. type things 
 We got money over here, we got money over here 
 See the jewels too loud baby girl I can't hear 
 Trash bag full of ones, throw the money in the air 
 We got money over here, you can tell by the wrist glow 
 Cash flow, nympho, see me in a '64 
 Pants hang low because the dough got me Krypto 
 Drop straight cash while you crabs at a rental 
 Eighty for the Jag', paper tags, what is info? 
 Money out the ass I don't brag I just get more 
 Say you getting cash, trying to flash I don't think so 
 Pull up in the jalapen Lamborghino 
 Up on a truck bet you've never seen those 
 With a hot little momma named Jalapeno 
 Drop stacks in a bag got to keep it G-code 
 There ain't no money over there, and she already know
