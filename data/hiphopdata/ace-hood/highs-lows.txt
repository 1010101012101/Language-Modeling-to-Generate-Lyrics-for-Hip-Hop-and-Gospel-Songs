My lows (Yeah) 
 Gettin' high to disguise my lows 
 My lows (Aeh) 
 Gettin' high to disguise my lows (I remember dat. Well all right) 
 A, moment of silence for this ceremony 
 And for whomever wishin' bad on me 
 Bet you wish you was here, a ha homie 
 And to the women who dis me, kiss da kicks on me 
 Now I'm doing it big, I tried to warn y'all 
 While they was hatin' and contemplating my downfall 
 I was in offices making offers on phone calls 
 While they would rather see me under like a ground hog 
 I'm about to blast off, feeling like NASA 
 I couldn't picture this, how much the frame cost 
 Remember hard times, momma can't walk 
 I used to sit in my room to cry the pain off 
 I'm aiming for the highs, made it through the lows 
 Left my old team, made it to the pros 
 Momma look at your son he got this kinda' glow 
 You just be ready when I come and tell you it's time to go 
 Gettin' high to disguise my lows 
 Gettin' high 'cause it's all that I know 
 Gettin' high to disguise my lows 
 Every night fly high and it glows 
 My highs, my lows 
 Gettin' high to disguise my lows 
 Yeah you could say I'm comfortably numb 
 Pen and paper but the paper's usually for the bud 
 Forget the moments when I find myself at loss of love 
 Chasing this money got me dancing to the Devil's drum 
 Drinking the Devil's rum, set up to lose but one 
 Except along the way I ended up where I begun 
 How imma be the type to up and run 
 When everything I am is deep inside the lyrics that I forge in blood 
 To some I'm simply scum, others a lazy bum 
 I'm everything you want but nothing to you all at once 
 Some o' y'all faker than a hipster with some gold fronts 
 Don't say I blame me or you ain't the only one under their thumb 
 Roll it up to light it up 
 Closing my eyes, soon as I feel high enough 
 Feel like I'm safer blowing smoke then givin' a fuck 
 That's how it goes when it's time to feel it stop 
 Gettin' high to disguise my lows 
 Gettin' high 'cause it's all that I know 
 Gettin' high to disguise my lows 
 Every night fly high and it glows 
 My highs, my lows 
 Getting high to disguise my lows 
 Paratrooper training parachutin' out in Paris 
 Clouds underneath my DC's, I'm livin' lavish 
 Skywalking like the world don't matter 
 Till my chute won't open, now my dome's all shattered 
 Ego on that G6, falling down on me quick 
 Was eagle on that steep cliff, now Nemo feelin' seasick 
 This game a vain thang, so many can't hang 
 I seen em' hustle hard and end up hearing bang bang 
 This trip gon take a while, kids pack your sodas 
 Some nights I'm strapped to go 
 And others feeling acrophobic 
 Roll it all up and now I'm on my Wiz Kalifa 
 You bring the house down and I'll call you Queen Latifa 
 Find yourself a heaven and an angel you can hold 
 They say the world is ending but we really never know 
 I trust the ground below me but it's always moving slow 
 So in case you need me now I'm 
 Gettin' high to disguise my lows 
 Gettin' high 'cause it's all that I know 
 Gettin' high to disguise my lows 
 Every night fly high and it glows 
 My highs, my lows 
 Gettin' high to disguise my lows
