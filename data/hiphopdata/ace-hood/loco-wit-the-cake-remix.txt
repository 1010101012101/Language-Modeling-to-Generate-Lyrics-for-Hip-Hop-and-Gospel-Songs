(Chorus - Schife) 
 Spent thirty in the mall 
 Going loco with the cake 
 Five cars sitting tall 
 Going loco with the cake 
 Ten on some Cali' bud 
 Going loco with the cake 
 Then I hit the strip club 
 Going loco with the cake 
 Glittered up my wrist 
 Going loco with the cake 
 Then I Guccied up my bitch 
 Going loco with the cake 
 Repping five with the pimps 
 Going loco with the cake 
 I put on my whole team 
 Going loco with the cake 
 (Verse 1 - Ace Hood) 
 Now hold up, wait a minute let the bad boy in it 
 I been off for about a minute 
 Now it's minutes on this grizzy 
 Where you been? 
 To every city, stacking money to the ceiling 
 Rubber bands, twenty grands in my pants, fuck with me! 
 I am Ace to the double O D, and I got to O.D. with all this cream 
 Going in loco, hello fellow yellow off Camaro 
 They know who it is! 
 Switching gears, boy you see what's in his ears 
 Piece of freezer on my chest, think my jeweler made a mess 
 Got me twenty chains on, you can't even see my neck 
 Always on the phone with money, boy they know I'm so obsessed 
 Underrated in the game, but I die for my respect 
 We the Best, Ace Hood, cut the motherfucking check nigga 
 (Verse 2 - Yo Gotti) 
 I'm going loco with the cake, I think I lost my mind 
 Get Emmitt on the phone, because I can't see the time 
 He put diamonds in the face, he done tricked a nigga again 
 Talked me into buying a necklace when I could've bought a Benz 
 I'm going loco in the hood, you local in your hood 
 I got four mojos in the trunk, a 502 under the hood 
 That's a hundred grand Cutlass, a five star bitch 
 And if you think I ain't thugging, I go loco in this bitch 
 Thirty two shot Glock, clip hanging out the bottom 
 Let off, but I missed and my young niggas got him 
 Yo Gotti fuck nigga, you think you go harder? 
 Just rein script off Galveston, we loco with them choppers 
 (Verse 3 - Young Dro) 
 Sniper boy, rifle boy, piper boy, Spyder toy 
 All my rims Eiffel boy, kush I need a lighter boy 
 Ether G, GSG, P$C, BAD, OMG, TTG, CTE, we be deep 
 P.O.L.O. PRP, AR he, they are we 
 SRT, SRG, Sergeant Dro, yes I be 
 Plus I got that vest, Bankhead you can't flex on me 
 Westside bitch I'm in the club, I got that TEC on me 
 Extra deep, TECs on me, swinging nothing less on me 
 Spending twenty at the bar, whole club, that's on me 
 Hunt it out, call it out, count it up, ball it out 
 I'm turning up, I'm turning up 
 Dro that what they talking about
