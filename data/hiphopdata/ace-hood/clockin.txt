(Intro - Ace Hood) 
 Yeah 
 Yay, straight up like that there B homie 
 Free Weezy! 
 Yay, let's get to the money my nigga 
 Mister Hood 
 Money to be made best believe a nigga clocking 
 Money to be made best believe a nigga clocking 
 Money to be made best believe a nigga clocking 
 I run it myself like a quarter back option 
 (Verse 1 - Ace Hood) 
 Okay there's money to be made 
 Let's go get this guap 
 And I'm fresh up on the block 
 Rubber band in my pockets 
 Nigga run it like I'm shock it 
 Balling like John Stockton 
 Couple stacks in my pocket 
 What the fuck is a wallet? 
 Nigga show me what you need oh 
 Call me the Young Nino 
 All I see is the C-notes 
 Triple digits and zeros 
 Nigga keep it on the D low 
 While I'm stacking the Fritos 
 I get the shit by you know 
 Send it to Puerto Rico 
 Nigga never move by two though 
 Tell them that's what it do though 
 Just bring my money back 
 Yeah I'm talking Polo 
 Nigga money to be made 
 That's money to be made 
 And if this ain't your shit 
 Then nigga you ain't getting paid 
 (Verse 2 - Ace Hood) 
 Okay now hundred thousand dollars 
 That's around my collar 
 Nigga I should see a doctor 
 Addicted to them dollars 
 Nigga holler (Holler) holler (Holler) holler (Holler) 
 Fuck off with you cowards 
 Just feed me with the money nigga 
 Watch how I devour 
 Nigga it's raining money 
 Watch I take a shower 
 All you niggas lame 
 Nine to five scholar 
 Nigga you be picking flowers 
 My hand is so tired 
 Counting for an hour 
 My accountant cannot follow 
 Nigga money to be made 
 All my niggas paid 
 Fresher than a mug in the latest fucking J's 
 And your bitch be on my dick though 
 Wet as fucking Crisco 
 As soon as we be done nigga, back onto that cash flow 
 (Verse 3 - AC) 
 You ain't got to tell me 
 But now the kush in my Louis V. duffle 
 Bet a nigga smell me 
 You little nigga, I'm better nigga 
 If any nigga tell me, that money ain't here pronto 
 Then I bet them chopper shells be arriving at his front door 
 I got to step up on my guns so 
 I see you from a distance 
 I'm in love with all this money 
 I ain't see some for you bitches 
 I do it because I want to 
 Clueless because I'm under 
 Influence of this Goosey but my fooleys make me wonder 
 Are they really hustling? Look at all these bundles 
 Are they really human? They eat you like piranhas 
 Look at my G-shock and you can tell a nigga clocking 
 I know them hoes watching but it's
