Hustler 
 Ruthless 
 Struggle 
 Real nigga radio 
 I been on my grind, I done hustled for green 
 I done hustled for days just to go and get paid 
 And I done been on them blocks, I done ran from no cops 
 And I done sold them rocks but at the end of the day 
 I got to get paid. 
 Well I'm a Broward County carnivore 
 Get it like I got a boy 
 Money what I hustled for, grind to the fucking core 
 Ever since that I was born, street nigga I was sworn 
 Made nigga fuck a whore, M.O. be the preacher boy 
 Either I'm the features meet the heater millimeter toy 
 Love to go and meet a boy, bang nice to meet you boy 
 Yeah, you a dead nigga comin' soon 
 Young Gutta I was born without that silver spoon 
 Pen and pad, Dad sniffing in the living room 
 Messing up his innertubes, rule number one to move 
 One supply you never use, that's the code I'm sticking to 
 Money is my institute, drug is my prostitute 
 And I call this my interlude, rappers they identi' fools 
 Grinding since I been in school 
 Eating without that fork or spoon, money man sticking to it 
 Money man you should do it, yappa chopper sticking to it 
 Thugging in my blood fluid 
 And momma taught me always told me "Get your money youngin" 
 Just don't amount to nothing 
 Always seemed to reach for something 
 I took her word in vain and claimed to keep that paper coming 
 Them case a hundreds keep them cloudy days away from sunny 
 But long nights a paranoia let them take it from me 
 So I toss and turn, blow and burn till my eyes turn 
 That yappa ferm pop a germ if any concerns 
 I got them goons lurking haters murder paint it perfect 
 That's dirty work and let my killers do unrated versions 
 Because I'm a hustler, so 954 
 Black tee from the neighborhood corner store 
 Thugged out, went south when I was just a boy 
 I figured money was my only institution ward 
 Was never crazy, fuck you pay me, never was a maybe 
 You ever play me, miss your lady, kiss your baby bye 
 Was only sixteen with pistols in my toolbox 
 I got to get paid 
 I got to get paid
