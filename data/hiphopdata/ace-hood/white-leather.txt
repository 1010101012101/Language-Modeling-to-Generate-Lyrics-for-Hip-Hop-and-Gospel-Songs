White leather, hot new pair of rims 
 Brand new pistol with a trigger like a hair pin 
 Well I just copped that mini Bentley four door 
 Always see me golow, oh I'm in it so low 
 My fitted sitting so low, put that black tee there 
 Fresh in my Polo, pistol under seat, only use that bitch for promo 
 Bad yellow broad, and she sucking on my zo zo 
 While I'm counting Euros, turned it to a funeral 
 Dead pres' is everywhere, money out the derriere 
 Yeah I'm doing very well, holler when you see me there 
 Boy I wish a nigga would, try me like I ain't hood 
 Over here we all good, run up if you think you could 
 You could meet my poster, leave you in a dumpster 
 Blast till my thumbs hurt, yeah nigga shooting first 
 Now that's nasty, you should see the Caddy 
 Cash money addict, I'm stunting like my daddy 
 Ace Hood swagging, but I'm kind of embarrassed 
 Walking like I'm pigeon toed, pockets full of cabbage and I'm sitting 
 And yeah, you see them choppers 
 And they chopping on that pearl Benz 
 They like a whirl wind, it'll reel your girl in 
 No baby momma drama, you can bring your girlfriend 
 So come to momma, hop in that dropper topper 
 Don't worry about your man that's why I carry the chopper 
 It go blocka blocka blocka b-blocka blocka blocka, yeah he going to need a doctor 
 I dump his ass off in Broward, tell him I holler holler 
 I dip off in that Impala, them rims still spinning 
 I did my best to stop them, I get them from the boarder 
 Across the water I order, this Tommy Melanoma 
 Diamonds kept in the cooler, ordered them from the mula 
 I hit up Kevin the jeweler 
 You ever try to play me I let you meet with the Ruger 
 That little body movement, them 26's a tumor 
 Put stripes on the Jag', I call that bitch in the Puma, this twenty two suited 
 And I'm sitting on that
